Use the arete, the face and the seam between the two vertically stacked blocks to work your way up the short first face. Once you start moving through the hole, use holds and chimney techniques (using both front and back faces) to work your way up. The easy top-out is to use the 'V' between the two rock faces above the hole. For a better top out, continue up the vertical face on the same side as the starting holds (i.e., on your right when facing into the cave).\n\nThis is one of the few problems in the area--maybe the only one--that's both novice-friendly and has a relatively clean fall zone.\n\n\n\nAt the back of the cave, near the left-hand side of the Lakeside Boulders area. The primary climbing face is on your right as you're looking into the cave.\n\nThe fall seems fairly clean, although there is a small tree at the bottom."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"yanZlEtVW+2bdO4WyrYXow==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.35087,62.44761]}},"createdBy":"Ayut1jrMVo6TUy8Gu8f47w==","_change":{"user":"Ayut1jrMVo6TUy8Gu8f47w==","historyId":"64142e23f0cf00832960bec1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:08:51.595Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,aba839bd-f3e7-59f6-8a5f-ce5cba6c17e7,ec7daec3-967f-5a4a-a48b-a2c1dbb8e15f,d65dd4fb-cb81-52af-9fd4-ffae47145b11,c9a9d994-4b55-5bed-9b74-ee16cab617a3","pathTokens":["Canada","Northwest Territories","Yellowknife","Tin Can Hill","Lakeside Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"v0"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.35087,62.44761]},"bbox":[-114.35184211320508,62.44716033981813,-114.34989788679492,62.44805966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"yanZlEtVW+2bdO4WyrYXow==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.35184211320508,62.44716033981813],[-114.34989788679492,62.44716033981813],[-114.34989788679492,62.44805966018187],[-114.35184211320508,62.44805966018187],[-114.35184211320508,62.44716033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"A boulder-height cliff and some talus that's split off from the hill, right at the edge of the lake. Looks like there are some burly lines here, including some possible serious V-hards with very little for your hands and feet. Almost nothing in this area looks like it's at the easy end of the spectrum.\n\nTo the right of the first few boulders, there is a wall covered in orange lichen. It gets a lot of moisture, so the rock is very chossy and not currently in a climbable state. But if you bring a hammer or pry bar and a lot of patience there might be some good lines hiding under there.Â \n\nEven farther to the right, the rock gets solid again.\n\nThe landing zones are generally not super clean, so spotters and a collection of pads are definitely recommended. Some potential lines are very close to the water and may not be safe to climb when the water is high."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142e23f0cf00832960bec1","prevHistoryId":"64142e21f0cf00832960beb9","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:08:47.063Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:16.081Z","updatedBy":"Ayut1jrMVo6TUy8Gu8f47w=="}
