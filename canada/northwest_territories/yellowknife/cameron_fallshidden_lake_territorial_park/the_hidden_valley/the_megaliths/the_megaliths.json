Geographically, it's the longest and largest of the areas and has several distinct sub-areas that are more separated from each other than features within the other areas.  The scale of it is also different.  Nothing is large enough to merit roped climbing or fixed gear, but the key boulders and areas are very large. \n  \n I've generally been avoiding subdividing areas here so that you don't have 40 subareas for every boulder or face with two routes each, but the features here are large and far enough apart it would be hard to navigate without sub-areas, so I've done that here. \n  \n This area is also still under construction and I'll be putting up material over the next week."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142d72f0cf00832960b63c","prevHistoryId":"64142d6ff0cf00832960b62b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:05:46.756Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:57.390Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
