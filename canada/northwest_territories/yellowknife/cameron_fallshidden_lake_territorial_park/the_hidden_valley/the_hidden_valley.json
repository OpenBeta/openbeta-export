Tucked far back in the Cameron Falls area, it has somehow evaded notice until now - the most evidence of other people I've seen anywhere near it is an old fire ring completely overgrown with caribou moss.  There are several sub-areas, but they all follow what appears to be an old watercourse of the Cameron River. \n  \n This area has more bouldering than anything else, but it also is the first trad-oriented crag in the area.  Whether the trad problems are that or spicy, tall highballs with bad landings is up to you.  But I'd recommend bringing some gear. \n  \n Since this is a newly discovered area and human impact here seems to be totally new, take care not to trample the flora anymore than you have to.  A lot of the routes are over muskeg and the rock is still quite vegetated.  I'm working to establish the \"standard\" ways of walking around the area to minimize impact, but it's easy to get diverted and step all over the plant life.  Try to stick to walking right in front of the obvious rock bands and the path of least resistance to get in."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142d7ef0cf00832960b6dd","prevHistoryId":"64142d7bf0cf00832960b6cc","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":11,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:04:37.225Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:57.435Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
