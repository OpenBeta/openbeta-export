It is short and far back enough that you can't see it from the established trail at all, and you have to get about halfway through the bushwhack before it suddenly sticks out of the forest.  Once you see it, it's easy to navigate off of it and the smaller bouldering areas.  This area is all the way at the very back of the Hidden Valley area. \n  \n The main face of the cliff consists of short (30-40') trad routes.  The bouldering starts on the detached blocks right in front of it and goes to the left around and up the granite knob the main face is on."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142d65f0cf00832960b5b2","prevHistoryId":"64142d60f0cf00832960b583","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:05:11.075Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:05:12.097Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
