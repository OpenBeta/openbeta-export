Bob Seger jammed some \"Old Time Rock &amp; Roll\" on a bejeweled jukebox in the background. Halfway through a batch of chips and salsa, I told him I was looking for a unique climb to do as far north as possible that included good, unclimbed rock, culture, and wildlife.\n\nHe smiled, took a sip of local brew and began to tell me about \"The Phoenix\" a 2,600-foot wall of perfect granite that had been climbed but not free climbed. On top of the climb was an untouched ridge of porcelain snow and ice leading to Peak 2451, also unclimbed. All in all, a 3,500-foot vertical route on one of the big remaining un-free-climbed features in North America. It was love at first bite.\n\n\"There's a caveat, though,\" he whispered. \"If you want to go, you gotta go with me.\"\n\nSip. Smile. Handshake.\n\n18 months later, I am writing from a fishing lodge in the Yukon, a few scabs on my hands and a devilish smile across my face, again eating chips and salsa. Over two days last week, we sent the route mostly onsight, minus a few sections of gratuitous mud removal. The climbing surprised us all by being moderate but consistent, splitter but exciting, with only a few pitches being easier than 5.10+ for over 800 meters. For some of the route, we followed an unfinished line called After School Special (5.9 A2) put up ten years ago by Tyler Stracker and team.\n\nMaster camera pilot James Q Martin joined us for the trip, snapping shots and film along the way. Ultra-cool-headed-ninja-chameleon climber Jeff Achey from Newcastle, Colorado joined also, and we made a great team. Notable pitches include a 40-foot roof offwidth squeeze a la Harding chimney and a 55-meter clean-enough-to-eat-off-of corner crack starting at ten inches then tapering to fingers by its terminus.\n\nAfter a 12-hour all-night descent in the freezing rain, the splitter dream weather decided to bid us adieu, and now we are working off our escape helicopter ride by swinging hammers, pick axes and shovels at the fishing lodge. Easily more effort than the climb itself.\n\nPat's wildlife promise didn't disappoint. We have seen wolf, grizzly and black bear, the northern lights, grayling, all sorts of birds, caribou, and southern red-necked dirtbags in their natural habitat. Our helicopter pilot Bruce says he has flown climbers around the area all summer long, and notices that no matter what country they are from, they, \"all have the same sparkle in their eye, and passion in their voice. It is bizarrely consistent. Surely you guys know something the rest of us don't.\"\n\nWell, I know one thing. This climbing thing is not too bad, when it's good. And when it's bad, well, it's still pretty good. * See Topo for route details.Â \n\n\n\nThe Northeastern wall of The Sundial/Mount Dracula massif. Multiple lines have been put up on the prominent face using similar crack systems including aid and stopping at various heights. The Phreenix is the only current free line to the summit.\n\nFULL MOUNTAIN RACK. very little fixed gear. Rappels are fixed pins and nuts. A light hammer could be useful. If going to the mountain summit, consider lightweight crampons. The FA got lucky and didn't need them after a particularly warm season."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"O5dkfUyTWXGSrOPiC53sJQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-127.98697,62.22199]}},"createdBy":"S4HdP9r7UtSWt1KORG9KNQ==","_change":{"user":"S4HdP9r7UtSWt1KORG9KNQ==","historyId":"64142cfff0cf00832960b124","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:59.959Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,aba839bd-f3e7-59f6-8a5f-ce5cba6c17e7,7b109cf8-744b-5eac-99ad-7d410b1bf113,f6b83bfb-cbee-59df-aa8f-4f4b0a66f555,3b97647d-4c93-5971-92ac-e3e20b9dec25","pathTokens":["Canada","Northwest Territories","Vampire Peaks","The Sundial aka Mt Dracula","The Phoenix"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-127.98697,62.22199]},"bbox":[-127.98793483848166,62.221540339818134,-127.9860051615183,62.22243966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"O5dkfUyTWXGSrOPiC53sJQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-127.98793483848166,62.221540339818134],[-127.9860051615183,62.221540339818134],[-127.9860051615183,62.22243966018187],[-127.98793483848166,62.22243966018187],[-127.98793483848166,62.221540339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"The 2,700 foot northeast face of the Sundial was first climbed in 1998 by Matt Childers, Harrison Shull and John Young who subsequently dubbed this feature the Phoenix."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142cfff0cf00832960b124","prevHistoryId":"64142cfef0cf00832960b11e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:57.784Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:15.200Z","updatedBy":"A0eXwIlJVGmA4TTBQ4iJaQ=="}
