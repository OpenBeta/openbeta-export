The White Tower climbs the left side of the same pillar. It seems a number of routes in the Cirque were named after magazines that were left for \"male entertainment\" in Fairy Meadows. Light in August was named after a book by William Faulkner.  \n  \n Start as for the White Tower and climb two pitches of loose uninspiring rock to the base of the thin crack on the right side of the white pillar. 5.6 \n  \n Pitch 3: Climb thin, highly technical cracks up a steep white wall to a fixed belay station. 5.12- \n  \n Pitch 4: Follow a widening crack into a strange, strenuous chimney that defies a free climbing rating (5.10+) and belay on a huge block. \n  \n At this point, it is possible to contine up the right side of the pillar up a grungy-looking right-facing dihedral. Light in August heads left up steep cracks in the center of the pillar.  \n  \n Pitch 5: Climb a steep hand crack through a number of roofs until you can arrange a gear belay at a less than vertical stance. 5.11 \n  \n Pitch 6: This is a short pitch and could be combined with the previous one. The hand crack becomes a thin flared, bottoming crack and splits a roof. Make cruxy moves over the roof and belay on a good ledge. 5.11+ \n  \n Pitch 7: Follow the crack, which becomes easier as the rock becomes more featured, to the huge ledge 100 feet from the summit. 5.11- \n  \n Pitch 8: Move the belay to the right along the big ledge and climb the big left-facing corner, 5.8. A difficult mantle move guards the top. 5.10+  \n  \n Descent: Rappel The White Tower, which tops out about 30 feet to the left of Light in August.\n\nStandard rack. Two ropes for the rapping."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"wUn5CRB+Uo2IWG7q0ipTtA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-127.5235,61.9939]}},"createdBy":"LlOT/EHRVCy8nyQAQE/76Q==","_change":{"user":"LlOT/EHRVCy8nyQAQE/76Q==","historyId":"64142ce1f0cf00832960afa6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:29.091Z"},{"_id":"Owxce1pVSvyyIOeQ7gARNQ==","name":"The White Tower","grades":{"yds":"5.11a"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Paul Freiburg, Kurt Blair, 1997   FFA Jay Knower, Yan Mongrain, August 2001","length":273,"content":{"description":"The aptly named White Tower climbs up the left side of the prominent white pillar on the east face of Terrace Tower. This route has become a popular (for the Cirque) day route as it is relatively uncommitting and holds great climbing on good rock. The first two pitches are throw-away, but the next four pitches up the steep wall more than make up for the bummer start. \n  \n Pitches 1 and 2: Follow a weakness up and left to the base of the white pillar. 5.6 \n  \n Pitch 3: Climb a wonderful crack in a left facing corner formed by the left side of the white pillar. This pitch has no real crux but the endurance pump feels about 11a.  \n  \n Pitch 4: Climb through a dark overhang. When we climbed this pitch, it was dry which allowed us to free it at about 11a. Because of the dark rock, its easy to imagine the pitch wet and therefore unfreable. If dry, grunt up the chimney using chicken wings. For pro, I remember less than optimal stoppers placed behind a wedged block.  \n  \n Pitch 5: Climb steep cracks up the face. Belay on the left side of a huge ledge that is one pitch below the top of the wall. 5.10+ \n  \n Pitch 6: Follow the same crack system up deteriorating rock to the top. 5.9 \n  \n Descent: Rap the route using two ropes.  \n\nStandard rack. Maybe bring extra hand-sized pieces for pitch 4. Two ropes are necessary for rapping.
