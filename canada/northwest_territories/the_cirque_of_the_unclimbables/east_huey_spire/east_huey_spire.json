Your goal is the eventual arrival at the notch between East and Middle Huey Spires.  It may be wise to rope up for sections of this approach if the moss is wet or the gully is icy.  To gain the actual start we had a few very short technical roped pitches. \n  \n P1) The beginning of the climb is easily identified as a wide easy corner at the notch.  Move up this corner and continue climbing the mossy face to a small ledge. Look for a nut marking the last rap. (60m) \n  \n P2)  Climb out through flakes and face trending up past a large blocky system on the left.  Make your way towards a large weakness above.  Note the slung horn overhead for the rap.  (60m)  Move belay above loose rock in the weakness to next face.  \n  \n P3)  Shoot up and out the fun cracks (5.9), aiming for the top and easier climbing.  (60m) \n  \n P4)  Easy fifth class takes you along the ridge to the summit block. \n  \n Descend the route.\n\nHead around the left side of East Huey Spire from the Meadows, shooting straight up the grassy slope once you see the opportunity to go around the tower.  Avoid excessive talus hopping.  <br />  <br /> Once you reach the gully spilling out with snow you've found the start.\nA standard alpine rack will do.  Extra nuts and bail tat may be advisable.  There are fixed rap stations in the gully.<br /><br />The fixed stations in the gully were already in place when we climbed the route (I don't carry many pins on my alpine rack), but we found no traces of ascent or descent anywhere on the West Ridge/Face."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"gKBKlbWtVJCrfUIXwNmOFg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-127.5235,61.9939]}},"createdBy":"QoGih8VZU+yg0f8YJqgYhA==","_change":{"user":"QoGih8VZU+yg0f8YJqgYhA==","historyId":"64142cdbf0cf00832960af6c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:23.423Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,aba839bd-f3e7-59f6-8a5f-ce5cba6c17e7,928b05e7-bc42-55c6-b7ee-bf52c9743ce7,80a04a95-b5ad-5490-ab7d-4217c0d98e16","pathTokens":["Canada","Northwest Territories","The Cirque of the Unclimbables","East Huey Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-127.5235,61.9939]},"bbox":[-127.52445760894123,61.99345033981814,-127.52254239105878,61.99434966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"gKBKlbWtVJCrfUIXwNmOFg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-127.52445760894123,61.99345033981814],[-127.52254239105878,61.99345033981814],[-127.52254239105878,61.99434966018186],[-127.52445760894123,61.99434966018186],[-127.52445760894123,61.99345033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"A proud and varied tower that dominates from Fairy Meadows base camps. East Huey is the terminal peak of the ridge running directly from Phenocryst Spire (left of the LFT).  Being so close to camp it is convenient that East Huey actually has a little something for everybody.   \n  \n While hard women free \"Riders on the Storm\" (5.12+) the rest of us can crag out on a number of wonderful crack lines at its base, less than 20 minutes from the Meadows.  Apparently Bill Buckingham and company found a wandering 4th class route to the summit that follows mossy terrace ledges around the south/east face, which they used to access the ridge and snag it's FAs.  Another very moderate climb lies just around the back side of the spire and takes the west ridge to the summit."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142cdbf0cf00832960af6c","prevHistoryId":"64142cd9f0cf00832960af66","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:19.932Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:15.605Z","updatedBy":"QoGih8VZU+yg0f8YJqgYhA=="}
