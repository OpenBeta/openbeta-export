The rock quality is poor, chossy, and largely unusable, but in the winter it becomes kilometres of ice climbing. Established routes are currently limited, but there is potential for significant development. The park contains campgrounds with sites that can be reserved through the territorial park system's website. In winter, the campground is unmaintained, but camping there is free.\n\nRoutes are slowly being added in since the area is still being explored and developed.  The canyon and the climbing area runs from Alexandra Falls in the west to Escarpment Creek in the east.  A trail runs from Alexandra Falls to Escarpment Creek along the north side of the canyon and provides easy access to the whole canyon and its climbing.  Someone keeps this trail groomed in the winter, so it makes for easy going.  Getting off the trail becomes a deep slog, however.  Escarpment Creek forms a small, steep canyon with its own waterfalls and drains into the second oxbow towards the east end of the canyon.  In the middle is Louise Falls.  There is a developed campground area by Louise Falls that goes right up to the edge of the canyon.  In the winter, the Alexandra Falls pull off is plowed and open, but it is far from most of the area's climbing.  The entrance to the Louise Falls campground is plowed for most of the winter and it's the easiest way to access the most concentrated ice climbing.  Most day hikers come in through here and keep a well-broken trail from the entrance to the trail along the canyon rim.  Escarpment Creek also has a campground, but its entrance is not plowed in the winter and gets deeply snowed in quickly.  It's the fastest way to get to the first oxbow, however.  Accessing Escarpment Creek for climbing can be done through the campground, but it's easiest from the road side where the highway actually crosses the creek.  It's a short hike down to the upper falls.  Rap down and walk further for the lower falls.  \n\nIt's not clear who did the FA of all routes.  Many are marked as unknown/uncertain, but they were probably done by a combination of JF Dufour, Eric Binion, Jeremy Dixon, and Graham Fournier.  If there was an earlier generation of climbers exploring here, please let me know.\n\nRoutes here are organized from west to east.  The canyon has a few clear subdivisions where the routes are concentrated:\n\n1.  Alexandra Falls Area - There is a straight segment of the canyon that starts with Alexandra Falls and continues for about a kilometre before turning slightly.\n\n2.  The Bend - A bend in the river between the Alexandra Falls Area and the Main Flows Area.  It starts with the bend from the first area and ends with a bend into the Main Flows Area.\n\n3.  Main Flows Area - Immediately in front of (south) of the Louise Falls campground/playground area.  It's a straight stretch in the river from the Bend that ends at the First Oxbow.  Routes here are currently Under Observation through the Filthy Chimney.\n\n4.  The First Oxbow - The first of two consecutive oxbows that follow the Main Flows Area.  Routes here are currently Waves through End of the Line.  The climbing area is a cliff that has two distinct levels.\n\n5.  The Second Oxbow - The second of the two oxbows.  Escarpment Creek drains into this oxbow.\n\n6.  Escarpment Creek - A smaller canyon that drains into the main canyon at its east end.  The creek itself has two waterfalls that freeze in the winter (the upper and lower falls) and some related flows around them."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142cf3f0cf00832960b0c5","prevHistoryId":"64142cf3f0cf00832960b0bb","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":24,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:32.538Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:15.004Z","updatedBy":"NroMo7g9WE6aR+WkjvDM8g=="}
