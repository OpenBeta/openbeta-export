Although our group attempted several other rock climbs in this valley, ice provided the safest travel. Feel free to reach out to us if you're interested in exploring the area (Mt. Sidney Dobson N or S appear to be unclimbed), we're happy to send aerial photos and info your way. \n\nTwisting Couloir\nCross shrund and climb steepening glacier ice (up to 65 degrees) using ice and rock pro. 270 meters.\n\nPeak 2419 (7,939 ft)\nAt the col we ventured up east climbing 25 meters of lichen covered low 5th class to gain a knife edge ridge. The ridge offered 100 meters of     varied ridge climbing (aucheval maneuvers, short downclimbs and stretches of dirt/moss sidewalk). We had hoped to follow this ridge another 1/2 km to gain the SW ridge of Mt Sidney Dobson North, unfortunately, the terrain looked committing and loose. Thus, we turned back, building a cairn on an undefined high point (approx. 2,419 m /7,939 ft) and rapped back into the col.\n\nPeak 2435 (7,989 ft) N 61°58.5903' W 127°37.159'\n Back at the col we started up the higher peak which flanked the left side of the couloir (south). Broken terrain up the NW gully provided less                exposed, but more strenuous and loose climbing (up to 5.7). 100 meters later we reached a broad prominent summit at 2,435 m (7,989 ft)\n\nDescent: To our surprise the upper E face which was not visible from the cirque below was a steep talus field which appeared to lead back down      to the glacier. Evidence of goat poop encouraged us down through ever looser and steepening talus. Back on the glacier, we decided that four V-      threads would probably have been a better option.\n\nAscend talus field to prominent bench (with massive goat cave), continue up the moraine (left side). A pleasant walk up the 30 degree glacier tongue lead into the cirque proper. The twisting couloir will now be visible, snaking up and right to an obscured col.

We characterize the area we visited as part of the \"Ragged Range\", but more specifically we explored east of the prominent and only named feature in the area; Mt. Sidney Dobson massif (more accurately referred to as Mt Sidney Dobson North and South). The area we visited was approximately 8km south of Mt Idea and the Cirque of the Unclimables (as the crow flies).\n\nA group of four Mazamas climbers- Wojtek Pagacz (Rossland, BC),  Amy Pagacz (Rossland, BC), Katie Mills (Portland, OR) and Nick Pappas (Portland, OR) visited this area in August 2019, funded by the Bob Wilson Expedition grant. While we can't speak highly of the rock quality, we were able to climb several peaks via an interesting ice couloir and scramble a small peak.  \n\nAs far as base camps go, it was quite luxe as we were up above the valley floor away from the bears and mosquitoes! It's doubtful anyone will return unless they're interested in putting up remote winter climbs.  The most prominent peaks (8,000ft+) would climb best as winter or mixed routes.  We saw evidence of discontinuous ice lines and based how much snow and rain we got in August a spring trip might be a better option. We'll try to permanently publish our aerial photos &amp; videos for future use as satellite images of this area are lacking. In the meantime, feel free to reach out if you're interested in planning a nearby trip or looking for more beta on *unclimbed* Sidney Dobson (North or South)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142ce4f0cf00832960afcb","prevHistoryId":"64142ce3f0cf00832960afc5","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:30.001Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:03:32.081Z","updatedBy":"c/PwbgZZXFCacRA0B872yg=="}
