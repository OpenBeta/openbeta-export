Depending on how you decide to climb the problems it can still be a challenge. The rock is covered in lichens, which is extremely annoying because the holds on the upper portion of the rock are slippery because of it. it could use some underbrush clearing, I climbed it in December on a super warm day. There are tons of possibilities when climbing this rock the hardest climb i was able to do was on the south face. The last photo shows a dangerous rock you could potentially fall on if your trying the hangover section on the south face. I would recommend a fall mat; I almost smoked myself on that rock a couple of times. \n\n\nOk to best describe the routes location. The route is east of moose jaw on CN rails Central Butte Subdivision between mile 30-29. As kind of a marker, the hamlet of Stony Beach has the rail line running through it about at mile 23-24. so as you continue. westward from regina. on hiway 1 you will pass a sign for stony beach continue even further down past the bell plain pota<a href=\"https://cdn2.apstatic.com/forum/90597.jpg\"></a>sh mine. eventually you will find the road that take you to my pinned crossing once you reach the crossing between the railroad and the road. its right next to like 3 farm houses, you must walk 2 miles west ish down the railroad track. (please be vigilant for trains the cn line has 1 a day going east and west to mo<a href=\"https://cdn2.apstatic.com/forum/90598.jpg\"></a>ose jaw each day)   above actual boulder location close to it anyway \nNEEDS MAT"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"fmGDu6poV/ensCkljHNzcw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.63841,50.39183]}},"createdBy":"hRV5gNj5WfmiT6oyGeDFoA==","_change":{"user":"hRV5gNj5WfmiT6oyGeDFoA==","historyId":"6414a242135731b691117df3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:18.386Z"},{"_id":"X9dipoaiQsWHW2u7mc9twQ==","name":"Cow Poo","grades":{"vscale":"v0"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":true,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","content":{"description":"Climb up good edges and through a bit of lichen.\n\nWest face\nPad"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"fmGDu6poV/ensCkljHNzcw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.63841,50.39183]}},"createdBy":"HHAVSDauVFqTyuqZaxvymw==","_change":{"user":"HHAVSDauVFqTyuqZaxvymw==","historyId":"6414a243135731b691117dfd","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:19.161Z"},{"_id":"v9L2L7nhTTiHM9A6cMHaZg==","name":"Hairy Spider","grades":{"vscale":"v1"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":true,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","length":4,"content":{"description":"Stand start on an obvious hold just left of the arete to the left of Silhouette.

This boulder is known as a glacial erratic. It is said to have been carried by the Wisconsin Glacier and then deposited in the middle of the prairie. Lucky for us Saskatchewanians. The rock is Hudson Bay Granite and despite being covered in lichen, it’s pretty great quality. The rock was historically used as a meeting site for pioneers and so, remains a respected historical site. Apparently there are some pictographs even though the majority of the human impact appears to be more recent and includes some spray paint. Try to respect the rock like you would any other place but keep in mind this rock is a rare commodity for Sask and somewhat respected as an historical site.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/14803942"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a244135731b691117e11","prevHistoryId":"6414a243135731b691117e07","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:15.818Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:36.835Z","updatedBy":"HHAVSDauVFqTyuqZaxvymw=="}
