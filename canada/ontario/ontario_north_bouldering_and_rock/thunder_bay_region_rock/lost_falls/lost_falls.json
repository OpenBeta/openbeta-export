Comfortable and enjoyable jamming and straightforward crack climbing to the top. Bring at least a couple blue and a couple gold C4's or equivalent. Mostly bigger cams to protect. There's some decent feet outside the crack as well to find a comfy position to place pro. Bolted anchor on the ledge above.\n\nPitch 2 (5.6 18m) More of scrambling climb, with a few variations on how you climb it. Felt a little tougher going to the left, but trending right felt like 5.6. Easy gear placements.\n\nPitch 3 (5.8 25m) A somewhat intimidating right facing roof section with a beautiful series of cracks running up it. There are great locations for gear throughout and tons of options for feet. It gets kind wide near the top, and sometimes there's a loose stone or two. Exit teh widening crack with root running into it and use the bolts on the face to the left for a belay.\n\nDescent: Probably easiest to walk back down using the scramble (with a rope to protect it). Walk a dozen or so meters further onto the top and look for the birch tree with a rope around it running down a gully. Scramble down this, then follow the gully down and right to return to the start.\n\n\n\nFor full directions and beta, strongly recommend picking up Aric Fishman's guidebook Thunder Bay Climbing. \n\nClimb up the boulder field towards the large amphitheater area. Turn into the bush just up from the boulder field and cross just below the bottom of the cliff. Continue past several beautiful crack lines until you see the right facing splitter corner crack. This is the start of pitch 1.\n\nLots of  big cams (below #4). A single #4 is handy, though not completely necessary. At least a couple #3's and a couple #2's are basically required."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"iaC4WcIXV6qixiY6ymZp7Q==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.32963,48.30933]}},"createdBy":"k3iQ7SL3W7Wt3rAzYRl5aQ==","_change":{"user":"k3iQ7SL3W7Wt3rAzYRl5aQ==","historyId":"64148696135731b691104377","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:26:14.196Z"},{"_id":"8gBGvXTaSje/X93LuagTbw==","name":"Priority Check","grades":{"yds":"5.9"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Will Meinen & Dave Benton, 2001","length":50,"content":{"description":"\nPitch 1 (5.9) An amazing first pitch of varied and enjoyable crack climbing. The resting and gear placement positions are really interesting. Be careful in the first couple meters as there is a slightly loose feeling side pull for your right hand. Just follow the crack straight to the top where you'll find a set of anchors with rap rings.\n\nPitch 2 (5.6) Really dirty, lichen covered and the top out has pretty loose rock. Worth the adventure to say you've topped out, and the section immediately above the belay station was fun, but it's not nearly the classic of pitch 1. Place some pro then commit to moving out right and up above the belay. Continue on the adventure, following the crack. Plug in some gear and walk up the slab to a large ledge. Be very careful from here, the rock quality is very suspect and crumbly. Carefully get up over the next little wall and belay off the bolts to your right, or use the giant tree/limb in front of you. \n\nDescent: Walk off the top to the 3rd class scramble protected by a rope, or follow the main hiking trail right and back to the parking area. You could also rappel both pitches in 2 rappels (I don't recommend).\n\n\n\nFull complete directions and descriptions, pick up Aric Fishman's guidebook Thunder Bay Climbing. \n\nHead up the boulder field. Before you get up to the amphitheater, turn left and crash through the bush. Com out at an open trail leading down the hill with loose rocks and soil. The climb is on this wall in front of you, facing South. The climb starts in a small left facing corner, with a beautiful clean crack system running up.\n\nA variety of cams and nuts. I placed my #4 very early on the first pitch and used mostly #2 and below sizes from there.
