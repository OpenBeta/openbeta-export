Traverse left and cruise up and back right on nice jugs. This takes you to the first crux which is getting from a slopey pinch to a decent crimp up and right. Pull a few more moves on good edges and trust your feet as you enter the crux of the route. Make a committing move into an upside-down dish hold (awesome) and find a way to either match or establish higher in this awkward position. Finally, reach up and left into an OK finger crack, or nail the hidden crimp if you can find it. Take a deep breath, cruise the crack to the top and smile thinking about how unique that crux was!\n\n\n\n5 minute walk to the right of Orange Crush or the Orangeman Wall.\n\n2 Anchors at the top"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"a8hmLWUqXr2vzupjB/YcKw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.20181,48.47157]}},"createdBy":"qsf1pel4UOSZZUPOLwUEwg==","_change":{"user":"qsf1pel4UOSZZUPOLwUEwg==","historyId":"64148667135731b691104114","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:25:27.480Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,c8c8a323-4d99-5810-b98e-9cb5165074cd,6e1b77cf-b5b7-5868-a21c-7ed1523a08d2,16ff6480-5778-5e18-b717-1655de5245d3,0ea0d60e-77bc-583d-a710-63d40099dde3,6bc8662d-652a-5ebd-afce-ea6307f61c2b","pathTokens":["Canada","Ontario","Ontario North Bouldering and Rock","Thunder Bay Region Rock","The Bluffs","Mind Over Matter Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.20181,48.47157]},"bbox":[-89.20248822908219,48.471120339818135,-89.2011317709178,48.47201966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"a8hmLWUqXr2vzupjB/YcKw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-89.20248822908219,48.471120339818135],[-89.2011317709178,48.471120339818135],[-89.2011317709178,48.47201966018187],[-89.20248822908219,48.47201966018187],[-89.20248822908219,48.471120339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"Spray Painted Wall roughly 5 minute walk to the climbers right of the Orangeman Wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148667135731b691104114","prevHistoryId":"64148666135731b69110410e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:25:25.594Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:21.694Z","updatedBy":"qsf1pel4UOSZZUPOLwUEwg=="}
