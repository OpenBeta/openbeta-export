You are never more than a foot or two above the ground, and no mats needed. No move is over V1, but it's really enjoyable to practice technical and efficient movement, or do some endurance training."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148672135731b691104192","prevHistoryId":"64148670135731b69110418a","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:25:34.153Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:25:38.100Z","updatedBy":"k3iQ7SL3W7Wt3rAzYRl5aQ=="}
