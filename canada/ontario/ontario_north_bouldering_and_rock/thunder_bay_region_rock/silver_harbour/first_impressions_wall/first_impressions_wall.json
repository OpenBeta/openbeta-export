The slopers and the flake at the upper crux can seep for a few days after rain, which can make the crux feel significantly harder.\n\nSPOILER ALERT - DON'T READ BELOW IF ONSIGHTING\n\nStart up on some easy blocky climbing until the good holds vanish. Reach out left to a decent crimp, compose yourself and make the first clip (I've seen many stick clip the first draw). From here on out, the real 5.10 climbing starts and doesn't let up until the top. There is one section early on where you are faced with a narrow vertical crack, many shorter climbers get stuck here and take/fall. Once you realize there is a nice hidden crimp above and to the left, this section feels much easier. Continue climbing through awesome sequences and moves until you reach the 5th bolt. Clip and try to recover here, you are about to enter the crux. Layback on a large flake to the left, establish higher and go for a decent pinch. Trust your feet and make some desperate moves on a series of slopers. The worst is over, but keep it together until the top or take a nice whipper!\n\n\n\nThe first route you will see following the left entrance from the parking lot. \n\n5 bolts + 2 anchored bolts at the top.
