Please take extra caution when walking. The ivy is in leaves of 3 with berries and turns red in late summer. It leaves a nasty rash if contacted.***The East Cliffs is where the real magic of the Cup and Saucer hides. In a striking 90 degree angle, the Niagara Escarpment drops directly down in a pattern of corners, faces, and dramatic aretes. Most of the climbing takes place above the forest, making the location and exposure supreme. There is plenty of potential for new routes, with only 10 to 15 lines bolted over a sample platter of rock right now. The climbing itself is on seemingly blank rock, but the climber will find surprisingly good pockets and flat ledges. The corners are easy to moderate, and the faces are hard technical pocket climbing. The aretes are unbolted at this time, and are sure to become future ulta-classics once bolted. Difficulty ranges from 5.6 to 5.12."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148471135731b691102e39","prevHistoryId":"64148470135731b691102e2f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:17:01.540Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:19.130Z","updatedBy":"xa7KKmWuVj6zAUDhlSkxaw=="}
