Once the boat is NO LONGER UNDER YOU, climb up using side pulls for about a meter before switching to crimps. After passing a surprisingly useful pocket 2/3 of the way up, jugs lead to an easy top out.\n\nAlternatively, start from in the water (bumping the grade up to V3) and mantle up onto the starting ledge.\n\nGet back down by jumping into the lake, or walking through the woods 50m to the west where the boat can safely pick you up.\n\n\n\nLocated on the north side of the bay, this climb is located on the only vertical wall.
