It is highest in the middle (60+ m) and peters down at both ends. The right side has a steep wall of good-looking, unbroken, reddish rock. There is a large talus slope at its left end that you can scramble up to reach the top of the cliff.  \n  \n A good trail has been cut into the middle of the first wall – it starts at a smaller clearing 50 m past the first big clearing along the base logging road. Look for a tripod of sticks around a central pole stuck into the ground (if it's still standing). The trail starts behind it.
