Talus field is on the left. It's obvious.\n\nBASSWOOD BLOC - If trying to find this bloc, first locate the small boulder on the side of the road on the east side of the talus that has the famed spray painted signature of our area. Bush Nookies with a smiley face. Park here and locate a faint and steep trail on the river side of the road. The bloc is a standalone boulder and with no leaves on the trees can probably be seen from the road.
