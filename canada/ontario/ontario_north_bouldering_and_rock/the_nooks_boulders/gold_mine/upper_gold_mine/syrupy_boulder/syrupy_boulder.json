The only reason it gets downgraded is because it is slightly an eliminate but such a cool climb on minuscule crimps and tiny tiny feet. The eliminate part only comes into play during the first couple moves. The start hold is located by the right arete and due to the shape of the boulder you can grab the right \"part of the leaf\". But as soon as you make a couple moves using the obvious crimps, It's full face climbing!\n\nThe start is on the right side of the \"maple leaf\". Start with both hands on a small crimp rail as far right and down as possible. Avoid using the right arete above you (the eliminate part) and only use the face holds to make your way to the top of the boulder. The right arete is only in play for a move or two, so it is a pretty pure line."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"4bYA+nwIXAm4vqMCFoccnw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.8869,46.61968]}},"createdBy":"88nTJBc+W4CD9OFKGczl8Q==","_change":{"user":"88nTJBc+W4CD9OFKGczl8Q==","historyId":"641485ee135731b691103afa","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:23:26.452Z"},{"_id":"Q9uyJmotRZG7P8k/4g92Dw==","name":"Mrs. Buttersworth","grades":{"vscale":"v6"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":true,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Brendan Baars","length":4,"content":{"description":"Climb the arete from a sit start utilizing small crimps, big moves, and the splits.\n\nStart in a full sit start with the left hand pinching the arete and the right hand on your choice of small crimps.
