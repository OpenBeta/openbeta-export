Stand start with the left hand on the lowest part of a good ledge above your head, specifically within two hand lengths from the start of the ledge. The right hand on the undercling ledge below it. Campus or try and paste a foot to move up and right utilizing lots of footwork. Decent holds lead to a committing top out. A must-do for anyone that can climb V5 or harder. View photos for better judgement on the left hand start. It has come to light that some may have used a big pad stack to move the left hand higher on the starting sloper ledge. I'm not unopposed to pad stacking if you are to short to reach the starting hold or the foot that people use but using a pad stack to move your hand way up the rail is cheating. This completely eliminates the first move crux and subsequently should not be considered a genuine send.\n\n\nOn the right side of the severe overhang.
