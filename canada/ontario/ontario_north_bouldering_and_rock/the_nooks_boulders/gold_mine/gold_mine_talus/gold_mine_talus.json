This does NOT include all the boulders that border on the edge of the talus. This may be unique for the area but many of the boulders that border the talus are large and climbable and those boulders are classified as Upper Gold Mine,\n\nBoulders in the talus are Silhouette, Burn and Rage, and Modern Era, The Creature, Tunnel VisionSilhouette should be easy to find. smack dab in the middle of the talus, close to the top.Burn and Rage is literally 20-30 feet south of Silhouette. It is hidden because it faces downhill and is on top of a small cliff.Modern Era is a little harder to find. It is at about the same height on the hill as the Syrupy boulder (maple leaf). but in a corridor of big blocs in the talus. From nighthawk (top of talus field) travel down hill in the talus between nighthawk and silhouette. You should enter a corridor and travel around a corner and your in the Modern Era zone.\n\nThe Creature and Tunnel Vision is just to the right of Silhouette.
