The majority of the development has been in the lower gold mine and is the closest to the road. The whole zone is within easy walking distance and is pretty dense. However, the middle and upper zones start to head up a steep hill with boulders the whole way. Due to the relative newness of the zone directions for the middle and upper zones are far from perfect as is the trail the further you travel uphill. I encourage everyone to look and save the topo photo for the lower gold mine. That trail leads to the middle and upper zones.\n\nArea classics include Performance Anxiety (V5), Color of Time (V9), Silhouette (V5), Strike Zone (V7), and Nighthawk (V5)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414855b135731b691103728","prevHistoryId":"64148548135731b69110363f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:17:57.906Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:17:58.899Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
