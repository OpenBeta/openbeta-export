Many of the popular and older climbing areas are right next to the road with very little time spent gaining access. The majority of the less frequented cliffs need an adventurous spirit and typically a canoe in order to get to. There is enough potential granite to last a lifetime here for the route developers out there, but again you'll need a canoe.\n\nThe Kenora region occupies an area of the Canadian Shield, a sparsely populated land of sparkling lakes and boreal forest that covers half of Canada. The Canadian Shield is the oldest and largest exposure of crystalline rock on the earth; the cliffs that we climb on are all that remain of mountain ranges that were born 2 to 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe climbing season normally extends from May through October, with spring and fall offering the best conditions. Rare years the season can begin in March and last till December. A portion of July can be stiflingly hot. Black fly and mosquitoes are typically the worst during June and July. You can usually stave off these beasts by wearing loose clothes that cover your arms and legs, camping in a windy spot, and retiring to the safety of your tent 1/2 hour before sunset. Always pack insect repellant.\n\nSome other sources of information can be found at:  accmanitoba.ca/climbing-guide/\n\nThere is a guide for purchase through MEC at:\n\nhttps://www.mec.ca/en/product/5014-127/Select-Rock-Climbing-In-NW-Ontario\n\nOr newer guidebook (for Kenora specifically):\n\"Kenora Rock Climbs\" by Mike Brown &amp; Ryan Munro - available at https://verticallstore.com/products/kenora-rock-climbs and several other sites"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414844a135731b691102cae","prevHistoryId":"64148445135731b691102c6f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:15:57.085Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:16.172Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
