With time running down before the drive home had to begin, and a light drizzle making it's way across the bay to the west, Sean tightened his laces and off he went.

Work the right edge, simultaneous while working the left edge-compression is your friend-match left, find the largest right foot you can find to push off of, reach high and right to grab the money slot to make the crux clip.  A few more similar moves will bring you up and to the final, but smaller rest of the route.  Recover as best as you can for the final few clips before the chains.
