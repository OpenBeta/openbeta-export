It is gneiss mostly covered with a black patina, from the sulfur dioxide pollution of yesteryear. It is located near the corner of Elm Street and Big Nickel Mine drive. Routes range from 15m-25m, with some bouldering along the left edge as the cliff drops in height. \n  \n Top of cliff access is easy up the (climber's) right side, and there are a few bolted anchors up top for setting top-ropes. Other climbs may require trad anchors, are there a good number of deep cracks up top suitable for these, too. \n  \n The name comes from the black rock, which you approach across a marsh, with a chimney belching smoke and industrial operations in the background. \n  \n Cliff was originally developed and bolted in 1994 by Peter Drzymala, Rob Paul, and Faye Petrie."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148646135731b691103efa","prevHistoryId":"64148645135731b691103ef0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:24:48.041Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:20.252Z","updatedBy":"bBwTRIMnWDuu49vBcq55gA=="}
