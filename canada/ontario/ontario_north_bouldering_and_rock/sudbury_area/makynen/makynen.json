The area is split in two by the highway. Makynen East consists of an overhanging cliff band a few hundred m long, running parallel to Makynen Road. The rock is strangely solid rock for Sudbury. Makynen West is composed of more true boulders, again of high quality for Sudbury standards. For whatever geological reasons, the rock is generally high in little crystals content, which creates wicked friction for big open-handed slopey moves, but is also pretty brutal on skin for those with tips not ready for the abuse.\n\nMost info created by Allan Barr."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148639135731b691103e81","prevHistoryId":"6414862b135731b691103db9","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:24:25.814Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:59.327Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
