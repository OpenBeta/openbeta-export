It is in the Nelson River drainage basin and is the source of the Seine River. The lake lies between Ontario Highway 17 on the north and Ontario Highway 11 on the south about 100 kilometres (62 mi) west of the city of Thunder Bay. The climbing is scattered about this massive lake that is littered with boulders and small islands (basically larger boulders). There are a few hidden gems throughout the area, just need some decent beta to get there"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148464135731b691102da8","prevHistoryId":"64148460135731b691102d7b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:16:33.429Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:23.462Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
