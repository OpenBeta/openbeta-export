Most climbs are about 50-70 ft here. This place has great fishing as well so bring a pole, some locals told me about this place when I was at the climbing gym in Kingston. Has some sport routes but mostly trad climbing I will try and get pictures and routes next time I am there, it may be too cold to climb on my next visit. There are other walls and areas to climb here and will explore more."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"MYfYDru2XBehR9e3t3mGvw==","historyId":"64148450135731b691102d02","prevHistoryId":"6414844f135731b691102cf4","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:16:31.712Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:16:32.936Z","updatedBy":"MYfYDru2XBehR9e3t3mGvw=="}
