Most climbs are about 50-70 ft here. This place has great fishing as well so bring a pole, some locals told me about this place when I was at the climbing gym in Kingston. Has some sport routes but mostly trad climbing I will try and get pictures and routes next time I am there, it may be too cold to climb on my next visit. There are other walls and areas to climb here and will explore more."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"i+9kxyt5SCePfnebFwg8dg==","historyId":"64f5d71d8c3211351b73a87e","prevHistoryId":"64f5d7128c3211351b73a866","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:16:31.712Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:16:32.936Z","updatedBy":"i+9kxyt5SCePfnebFwg8dg=="}
