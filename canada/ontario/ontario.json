The local communities are large and strong.\n\nIn southern Ontario, the limestone and dolostone of the 700km long Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, provides fifty or more crags from Niagara Falls up to Tobermory on the Bruce Pennisula. Recent decades have added a number of high quality sport crags to the trad areas established in the sixties.

The Ontario Access Coalition (OAC) monitors this, and negotiates for access to cliffs, or to avoid closures.
