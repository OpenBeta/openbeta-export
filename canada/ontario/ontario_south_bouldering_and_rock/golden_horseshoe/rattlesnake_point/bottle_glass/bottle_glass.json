Glass is a small sport / trad area between the main Rattlesnake Point wall and Buffalo Crag.

It sits in the sun year round making it great for early and late season climbing. This area is less crowded than the main wall or BC, but can be busy on weekends. It has the only sport routes at Rattlesnake. You will often find instructors teaching in this area.  \n  \n The cliff is rather short in this area ranging from high-ball boulder problem to a little over your typical gym wall. The rock is typical escarpment limestone but is less polished here than at the main wall.  \n  \n Bring a stick-clip as the first bolts on some of the routes are rather high.  \n  \n This area is great for a quick climbing session, or for finishing your day with quick sport climbs, but the diminutive stature of the cliff and small number of routes will limit the amount of time you will want to spend here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148a9c135731b691107427","prevHistoryId":"64148a9c135731b69110741d","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":22,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:43:10.902Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:22.445Z","updatedBy":"SXfWvuXXU6OaAFmBRHDMKw=="}
