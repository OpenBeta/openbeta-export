Start up to the right until you reach a short vertical crack and a mantle off to the right. This is the first \"crux\" (if anything on this cruiser could be considered a crux). Then walk left along the large ledge until you round a small corner and see another crack. Continue upwards to the right, passing the old piton and finishing by lay-backing up the crack underneath the anchor tree at the top. This piton and others that I have encountered at this crag makes me think that I am far from the first person to climb here. If anyone has any info on previous ascents please let me know!\n\nThere is a 5.9+ variant where you stay left after the piton instead of bearing right.\n\nThere are 2 ways up to the top and three ways down. You can access the anchor tree either by scrambling up the low cliffs a couple hundred feet to the left, or by doing some 5th class scrambling up to the right of Nauti Nana where some cliff jumpers have included some sketchy fixed ropes. \n\nMidway along the chain of cliffs is a large corner protruding into the lake. The top of this is the hallowed jumping cliff. To the right, along the edge of the cliff there is a large, old, gnarled tree. This is what we used for a top-rope anchor.Â \nTop-rope off the tree at the top. <br /> I have yet to lead this trad, but it seems very doable.  <br /> I have soloed this in the past, which was a pretty fun climb. I'm not sure whether this could be considered a deep water solo, as there are points where you would hit a ledge if you fell, but the water is very deep and safe on the whole."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"BHMSanDCUVyGJ6NEdjRPKA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.74668,45.24591]}},"createdBy":"pLemnrXQWua+VjhOZI3+9Q==","_change":{"user":"pLemnrXQWua+VjhOZI3+9Q==","historyId":"64148d52135731b691109215","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:54:58.421Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,c8c8a323-4d99-5810-b98e-9cb5165074cd,c63302da-5ca4-56f4-ac7f-cedda47a3b96,e83305ad-8401-5e9e-bd68-2cdd520f6e8d,ea20e6ba-7ef5-5fa6-a0ca-100c46a64926,0473126a-70c2-515c-8627-a34476344f28","pathTokens":["Canada","Ontario","Ontario South Bouldering and Rock","Muskoka Lakes","Lake Joseph","Jumping Cliff"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.74668,45.24591]},"bbox":[-79.74731866250214,45.245460339818145,-79.74604133749784,45.246359660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"BHMSanDCUVyGJ6NEdjRPKA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-79.74731866250214,45.245460339818145],[-79.74604133749784,45.245460339818145],[-79.74604133749784,45.246359660181874],[-79.74731866250214,45.246359660181874],[-79.74731866250214,45.245460339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is a larger cliff on the northern end of the lake, opposite of Blueberry island. Over the decades several generations of lake-goers have scaled these walls to jump from two prime jumping spots, one at roughly 45 feet and the other at roughly 60 feet. Come here if you want to try some fun climbs in a unique setting. These routes have the best descent around. However, jump at your own risk as this might be private land and there have been several accidents involving people entering the water awkwardly.  \n  \n There is a lot of potential here for top-rope and trad routes. The walls are decently tall and there are plenty of interesting overhangs and caves to keep you engaged.  \n  \n Please let me know if there are local climbers! I have put up some routes here but I think some people may have been here first as I have found several old Pitons."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148d52135731b691109215","prevHistoryId":"64148d51135731b69110920f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:54:56.255Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:23.531Z","updatedBy":"pLemnrXQWua+VjhOZI3+9Q=="}
