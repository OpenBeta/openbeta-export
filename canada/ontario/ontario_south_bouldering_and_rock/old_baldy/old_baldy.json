The cliff receives plenty of afternoon sunshine, making it climbable even fairly early in the season. \n  \n When climbing at Old Baldy, please do not use the trees at the top of the crag as belays or rappel anchors. These trees are mostly old-growth cedars and are an irreplacable part of our environmental heritage. All climbs have been equipped with bolt anchors. The anchors, however, are not accessible from the top of the cliff, which means that someone in your party has to be able to lead your route. \n  \n This is a lead climbing area, NOT a top roping area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148d8a135731b6911094dc","prevHistoryId":"64148d82135731b69110947b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:55:01.530Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:55:02.722Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
