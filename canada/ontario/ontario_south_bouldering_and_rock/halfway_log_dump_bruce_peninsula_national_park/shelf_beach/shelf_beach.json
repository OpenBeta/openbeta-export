Please respect the guidelines set out by Parks Canada and do not clean or climb these boulders. \n  \n This restriction is really not a problem as Shelf Beach offers a great concentration of good to excellent problems. The classics include Queensnake, Rusty Blackbird, Cedar Arete, The Whale, and The Crab with many other worthwhile problems scattered about. Many groups never move beyond the Shelf Beach, especially on their first trip to the area due to quality of problems found here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148b03135731b691107a36","prevHistoryId":"64148aff135731b691107a1b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:44:44.495Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:44:45.615Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
