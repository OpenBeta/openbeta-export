Varied difficulties, including Top-Rope, Trad, Sport and Mixed. During winter, it offers some nice ice. \n  \n The Main Cliff area is west facing so early season climbs can be chilly. The rock appears to be fractured granite with routes ranging from dirty, loose and sketchy to sloper filled slab. The area was established some time ago and with a recent (2010?) redevelopment, some grades may vary, as some are graded with the old-school grading mentality and whereas the newer developments, with the newer mentality. \n  \n There is alot of potential for development, many new routes are being red-tagged as of summer 2012.  \n  \n The following is an excerpt from the 'Climbing Around Ottawa' guidebook, created by Christiaan Burchell, and is available at ottawaclimbing.com"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641487c7135731b69110503d","prevHistoryId":"641487c5135731b69110502c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:30:42.269Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:30:43.692Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
