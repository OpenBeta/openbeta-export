This is where you get off your boats and begin climbing. You will first traverse to the far left of the face. Then you will proceed upwards. At around 15 feet you get to a nice ledge where you can plan the rest of the climb here, you can take a left and climb a dihedral, I did not climb this one. I went straight up and climbed the small crack that is directly under a tree. There are some loose rocks to the right of the overhanging tree. This rock has been climbed before so there are sure to be routes that others have done.\n\nLake of Bays, Ontario, Canada. The start is a ledge you can just step right off of the boat and chalk up. The only safe way to descend is jumping of the ledge by the tree. You COULD keep going to top out after the ledge near the tree. But this is very dangerous for if you fall you will hit the ledge. The most obvious landmark is the large dihedral and a overhanging tree. These are commonly called by locals the 'dorset rocks' and the 'dorset jumping rocks' as it is a very popular destination to jump from.\nNO PROTECTION. This is DWS, falling will result in you scraping down the rock unless you manage to push off."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"3vp+CuduWq6YsYVpCpM4dA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.92747,45.25647]}},"createdBy":"xbGeAJzsUlqRDtfdm4BncA==","_change":{"user":"xbGeAJzsUlqRDtfdm4BncA==","historyId":"64148b1c135731b691107b23","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:45:32.643Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,c8c8a323-4d99-5810-b98e-9cb5165074cd,c63302da-5ca4-56f4-ac7f-cedda47a3b96,defa7e0a-e76e-5aae-98b1-85690a933874","pathTokens":["Canada","Ontario","Ontario South Bouldering and Rock","Lake of Bays, Ontario, Canada"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.92747,45.25647]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"3vp+CuduWq6YsYVpCpM4dA=="},"content":{"description":"This is a popular jumping rock, as of now it is only possible to deep water solo.
