Bolt #5 is run out but it is just before pulling the crux of the climb. You then come around under the roof onto an awkward block. Come out into the upper corner, clip above the roof, then easy slabby climbing to the top (7th bolt halfway up). The bolting is spread out on this route. Fun climbing, but eases up severely after coming out from under and around the roof. Expect big falls on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th clips... Missing the 3rd may result in a ground fall. You shouldn't be concerned about the 6th or 7th clip as you've already pulled the crux at this point. The slabby climbing on the upper section is very gentle.Â \n\n\n7 bolts + anchors"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ovoAaRdYVOqGq/m9daz3kQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.22386,45.00792]}},"createdBy":"ayTRLvr1W/SyQDO9+j8v7g==","_change":{"user":"ayTRLvr1W/SyQDO9+j8v7g==","historyId":"64148cbe135731b691108a2c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:52:30.402Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,c8c8a323-4d99-5810-b98e-9cb5165074cd,c63302da-5ca4-56f4-ac7f-cedda47a3b96,b0d14301-8290-56cd-8ecc-fa15cab7c78a,a2fa0069-1758-54ea-86ab-f9bd75acf791","pathTokens":["Canada","Ontario","Ontario South Bouldering and Rock","Lion's Head","Summer Residence Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.22386,45.00792]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"ovoAaRdYVOqGq/m9daz3kQ=="},"content":{"description":"Ground up climbing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148cbe135731b691108a2c","prevHistoryId":"64148cbd135731b691108a26","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T15:52:28.296Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:52:30.409Z","updatedBy":"ayTRLvr1W/SyQDO9+j8v7g=="}
