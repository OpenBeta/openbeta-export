I haven't done it and don't know the name. The rating is just a guess since they make you list one. It looks tough. There is a pin at the start and a couple of fixed wires along the way.\n\nThe center of the left cave.\nGear plus one fixed pin and a couple of fixed nuts. Lower off one of the sport route anchors to the side."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"nkAu55vSVxiJxqnWhkz4dg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.26922,45.02869]}},"createdBy":"R4c6wyH8VI6oaF+BwxMhFQ==","_change":{"user":"R4c6wyH8VI6oaF+BwxMhFQ==","historyId":"64148eae135731b69110a275","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:00:46.183Z"},{"_id":"qvuUrZ/oTAye+WS/PTxAqw==","name":"White Zombie","grades":{"yds":"5.11a"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Oates","length":18,"content":{"description":"This route starts below a right facing corner and climbs up to a ledgy area and then trends left and up over the roof.\n\nThis route is the furthest route to the right on the B-MW\n6 bolts and anchors"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"nkAu55vSVxiJxqnWhkz4dg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.26922,45.02869]}},"createdBy":"R4c6wyH8VI6oaF+BwxMhFQ==","_change":{"user":"R4c6wyH8VI6oaF+BwxMhFQ==","historyId":"64148eae135731b69110a27f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:00:46.653Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,c8c8a323-4d99-5810-b98e-9cb5165074cd,c63302da-5ca4-56f4-ac7f-cedda47a3b96,2fdc26f8-07ec-5df7-966a-5533a5040167,9e402ee7-9bd2-5718-89c6-a9d6864cf876","pathTokens":["Canada","Ontario","Ontario South Bouldering and Rock","White Bluff","B-Movie Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.26922,45.02869]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"nkAu55vSVxiJxqnWhkz4dg=="},"content":{"description":"The first wall normally encountered at White Bluff. It has the highest concentration and a majority of the routes at WB. Most routes are about 45 to 60 feet long. Pockets tend to be the name of the game here with a few flakes, edges and big jugs mixed in. This area gets morning sun and afternoon shade. Some routes are shaded all day by the trees. It is good to avoid getting to this wall to early in the morning if it is hot. A set of 12 draws should be plenty for all the routes on this wall. Can be good on rainy days."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148eae135731b69110a27f","prevHistoryId":"64148eae135731b69110a275","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":24,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:00:30.891Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:00:46.658Z","updatedBy":"R4c6wyH8VI6oaF+BwxMhFQ=="}
