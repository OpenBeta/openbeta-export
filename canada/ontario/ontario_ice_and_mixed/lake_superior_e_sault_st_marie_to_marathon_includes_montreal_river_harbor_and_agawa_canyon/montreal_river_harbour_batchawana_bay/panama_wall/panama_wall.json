The top anchor is in a pseudo cave. \n  \n It is short enough to be top-roped, but the anchors at the top are not accessible other than by climbing it, so it will require someone leading it first to setup the TR. \n  \n A variation is to climb to right of the main ice flow and climb an M3'ish level mixed route.\n\nThere are bolts at the top for an anchor, or at least there were when I climbed it.  Other than that, there were no other bolts on the route, so it must be protected with screws.  At most 4 screws on the route itself (aside from any screws for the anchor)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"QTLH5EJQVpWC3Nw0YNqGGw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.6661,47.0477]}},"createdBy":"Yt+FnoYYU4S3y1aB7gpF+Q==","_change":{"user":"Yt+FnoYYU4S3y1aB7gpF+Q==","historyId":"641430eef0cf00832960dae1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:20:46.113Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,c8c8a323-4d99-5810-b98e-9cb5165074cd,4e4da29e-7d7d-5e50-858d-9028bc75565c,849d5109-aa5d-5cbb-ab5f-e49da6e6f906,d92a5891-ea29-5448-8e73-a906b21a945f,4132c7e4-4250-5695-82dc-dc3460da861b","pathTokens":["Canada","Ontario","Ontario Ice and Mixed","LAKE SUPERIOR E: Sault St. Marie to Marathon, includes Montreal River Harbor and Agawa Canyon","Montreal River Harbour / Batchawana Bay","Panama Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.6661,47.0477]},"bbox":[-84.66675991674816,47.047250339818135,-84.66544008325185,47.04814966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"QTLH5EJQVpWC3Nw0YNqGGw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-84.66675991674816,47.047250339818135],[-84.66544008325185,47.047250339818135],[-84.66544008325185,47.04814966018187],[-84.66675991674816,47.04814966018187],[-84.66675991674816,47.047250339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"6 climbs, 25m tall"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"Sc4XY+6dW3SdEcO+tFLnhg==","historyId":"641483a9135731b6911026e0","prevHistoryId":"641430eef0cf00832960dae1","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:20:44.016Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:18.093Z","updatedBy":"Sc4XY+6dW3SdEcO+tFLnhg=="}
