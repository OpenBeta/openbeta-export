If you follow the path, it should lead you directly to the base.\nThere are options to either set up anchors from above, or lead the route. <br />  <br /> For leading, beginners may want to bring about 8 screws, more experienced can send it with less. <br />  <br /> To set up a top rope, there is much natural anchors at the top, many of which have webbing already set up.
