Located on public land about 25 minutes north of Terrace Bay, and 2hr 45min from Thunder Bay, this 100m tall x 140 m wide icewall has a large variety of distinct lines ranging from WI2 to WI4.\n\nIt would be of little value to split up every possible route up this thing because so many possible variations exist, though I know some areas do have this treatment. For now, it's just one big route with a bunch of ways up and down.Â \n\nPhotos show some of the paths we have taken in the past couple of weeks which were all in the WI2+-3 range. There are currently two rap stations on trees at the top (shown in photos). The climber's right side has plenty of trees on the large tier that could be rapped off if using 60m ropes (tie knots)! If you go, be prepared to build a rap station and/or a V thread. This would be an unfortunate place to realize you aren't able to get down.\n\nFrom the lake, you can either climb the somewhat thin but somewhat fun WI2 pitch that lies below the walkable tier below the big ice, or hike to your left and circumvent it.\n\n\nTwo things to note before heading here:\nFirstly, you have to cross a lake/river to access the climbing. Given the steady flow of this river and dam upstream, the ice can be inconsistent. Take extreme caution when crossing. I won't detail the best methods to do that here (mainly because I don't know them) but it would be very wise to check the ice thickness with a screw and judge whether you are comfortable with crossing. When we went, we broke through a false layer of ice and got wet feet a few times, but it could have gone much differently. I can say for sure that you should avoid the narrow section to the south end of the lake (right side when facing the lake from parking spot) as it is commonly open water or thin ice.\nSecondly, this is a more remote climbing area than Orient Bay or most of the climbs around Thunder Bay. We didn't have cell service until the top of the route and the road is infinitely more quiet than the 11/17. Be prepared with all your multi pitch skills before you go, or consider hiring a guide (Aric Fishman, Shaun Parent, etc.). You won't be able to call for a rescue very easily.\n\nAnyone looking to do 2-3 pitch climbing in the WI2+ to WI3+ will have an absolute blast here. Tons of variety for lines in these grades with good quality ice and a very impressive yet quiet setting. Have fun, be safe, and message with any questions.\n\nAll credit for FA and discovery goes to Shaun Parent, I just located it and figured it was time for the public to know about this incredible place after letting Shaun know.\n\n\n\nDrive to the northern end of Terrace Bay and turn onto Mill Road. Passing the AV Terrace Bay mill site on your left side, turn right at about 500m onto Longlac Backroad (one of many names for this road, but its the road that heads north from Terrace Bay all the way to Longlac). Start your trip meter here. This road is plowed in the winter, but the plows probably won't get to it until the afternoon so be prepared if heading up here with snow in the forecast. At kilometer 19 (there is a marker), start watching for a place to pull over on the left. There should be a snowmobile trail departing southwest from the place you park (48.938229, -87.059200). Don't take this trail.\n\nAfter parking, head straight into the bush northeast towards the lake - we have yet to cut and flag a trail. There is a somewhat steep drop onto the lake ice but it's manageable. Take any path you like right to the base of the wall (48.945509, -87.061735).\n\nSee photo for the path we took but do what you think is right and safe. At this point, there are no established trails that feel any better than straight bushwacking, so minimizing your time walking through the forest is a good idea.\n\nTake extreme caution when crossing the lake as it freezes inconsistently and has a dam upstream. Check the thickness with a screw but be aware that it may not be as thick as you measure for the whole surface of the lake. Coming to Scarpa in the early season would be quite risky.\n\nIce screws"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"iBLK6gP1X56dlxhq27RQiw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.06134,48.94604]}},"createdBy":"f3lzFqlYUlGd9+BqxQfP2A==","_change":{"user":"f3lzFqlYUlGd9+BqxQfP2A==","historyId":"64143156f0cf00832960df33","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:22:30.422Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,c8c8a323-4d99-5810-b98e-9cb5165074cd,4e4da29e-7d7d-5e50-858d-9028bc75565c,089202f5-fa2f-540f-9a5e-b24a140b329d,8812caea-03f5-5f9e-9d97-186adbb4508b","pathTokens":["Canada","Ontario","Ontario Ice and Mixed","LAKE SUPERIOR W: Marathon to Thunder Bay, includes Kama and Orient Bay","Scarpa de Hielo Grande Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.06134,48.94604]},"bbox":[-87.06202465447365,48.945590339818146,-87.06065534552637,48.94648966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"iBLK6gP1X56dlxhq27RQiw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.06202465447365,48.945590339818146],[-87.06065534552637,48.945590339818146],[-87.06065534552637,48.94648966018187],[-87.06202465447365,48.94648966018187],[-87.06202465447365,48.945590339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":"See route description for details."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"f3lzFqlYUlGd9+BqxQfP2A==","historyId":"641483d2135731b691102799","prevHistoryId":"64143156f0cf00832960df33","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:22:27.255Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:18.491Z","updatedBy":"f3lzFqlYUlGd9+BqxQfP2A=="}
