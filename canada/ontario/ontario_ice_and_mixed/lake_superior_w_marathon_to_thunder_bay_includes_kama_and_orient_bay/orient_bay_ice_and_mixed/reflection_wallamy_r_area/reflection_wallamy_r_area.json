Very close to Highway 11, so it is impossible to miss (well, unless you're looking east the entire time). Looks dead vertical from the distance but from up close it is actually well featured, three-dimensional, and with quite a few options. Reflection Wall faces south-southwest so it gets baked. Sun exposure can cause it to be chandeliered and reportedly dangerous in late spring. Eric Landmann in his \"Superior Ice\" (currently out of print) mentions an event of one-third of the wall collapsing. Pumpy and fun!\n\n\nPark as for Ice Palace and head along Hwy 11 until directly in front of Reflection Wall. From here go over the guardrail, drop down, and then ascent steep slope to the left of the ice. At the top of the slope head right towards the base of Reflection Wall. In February, the slope was filled with deep snow, but it can get icy in late season.\nIce screws. \"Superior Ice\" suggests 4, but I'd bring few more -- like three times as many :) Top anchor from slings on trees. A pair of 60m ropes gets you back to the base.

I had made it up about 50' to a decent ledge when the decision was made to bail.
