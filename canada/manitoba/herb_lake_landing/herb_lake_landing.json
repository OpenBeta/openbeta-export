There are a number of 30 to 45 foot top rope and trad routes here as well as some boulder problems. All the route anchors are accessible from the top. Some to the anchor bolts are old and rusty, some went in in 2016.  \n  \n This area contains boulders, face and crack climbs with one horizontal roof. Things are a little dirty as the cliffs don't see that much climbing action. There is room for development of new routes and boulder problems here.  \n  \n Herb Lake Landing is a pretty cool place, but unless you're up there anyway, its probably not worth the drive from Winnipeg. \n  \n  herblakelanding.ca/cliffs.htm"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414235af0cf0083296045de","prevHistoryId":"64142354f0cf00832960459b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:22:36.219Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:22:38.170Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
