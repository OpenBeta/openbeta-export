The area is home to a number of granite cliff lines ranging in height from approx. 30-50 feet. What the climbs tend to lack in height they make up for in their generally sustained nature, with most being unbroken by ledges. Access to the top of the cliffs is straightforward and all routes feature bolted anchors, most of which are easily accessible from the top of the cliff for setting up top ropes.\n\nCurrently the area is still undergoing development. Expect to see more information appear here over the following weeks as sub areas and routes are added! We're excited to share it all with you all as soon as possible!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414236ff0cf0083296046bc","prevHistoryId":"6414236ef0cf0083296046b6","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:23:09.298Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:23:10.293Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
