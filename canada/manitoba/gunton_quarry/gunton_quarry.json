It offers moderate and easy top rope climbing with a few fixed bolts and optional gear placements (be careful!). The best climbs are found on the Western side of the East Quarry or the Eastern side of the West Quarry. I believe this area is on private property so be very respectful not to leave any trace. You may encounter dirt bikes and ATVs passing by but most will stop to say hello. If anyone has info on route names and their grades please feel free to edit this page. ***It should be noted that the route names are created by me as I don't know their actual names. Their grades are also based on the beta found the Alpine Club of Canada (Manitoba section) page."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142349f0cf00832960452c","prevHistoryId":"64142343f0cf0083296044cb","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:22:25.337Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:13.864Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
