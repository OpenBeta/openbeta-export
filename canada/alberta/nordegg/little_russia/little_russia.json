Steep, burly routes on solid limestone ranging from 5.8 to 5.13. Located in the Peskett canyon with only 15 min approach this area is perfect for someone who is looking to work on a hard climb in a beautiful canyon setting. Climbs have been developed on both sides with the left (North) side been steeper, harder and mainly in the shade and right (South) side, easier, less steep and sunnier. The beginning of the canyon (before the first waterfall) harbours single pitch sport climbs. Deeper in the canyon (~100m) after the first waterfall a couple dozens of drytool climbs had been established. First multi pitch climb (Zardoz, 12c, 6 pitches) is added in July 2020 and there are more to come.\n\nIf you see a bolted line that is labeled as a \"Project\" or has a tape on the first bolt it is probably not been cleaned/climbed yet. Please do not attempt it! More and more climbs will be coming up. Don't hesitate to bring your brush and help the developers to clean the holds. Since this area is new, some loose rock still may exist, and so wear your helmet.\n\nDue to a short approach and rain protected area, the\"Start of the line\" overhang area is very family friendly.\n\nMost of the sport climbs in this area are named after people who helped with the project.\n\nMay their names live forever!\n\n60m rope is enough for all the routes except \"Start of the Line\" extension that needs 70m.\n\nCome and check it out!\n\nIf you want to help this project you can donate for bolts at:\n\nhttps://ca.gofundme.com/f/david-thompson-bolt-fund"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413497bf0cf0083295db2cf","prevHistoryId":"64134972f0cf0083295db26e","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:50:32.834Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:50:34.576Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
