Finish on easy face to a semi hanging belay. \n\nP2. 5.12a, 11 bolts, 25m. One of the best 12s at the crag. From P1 belay station step up and right laybacking on the jugs reaching first no hands rest. Do an airy traverse right climbing to the base of first roof. Pull the roof on the crimps (1st crux) to the huge jugs and second no hands rest below another two-step roof. Climb through first step (easy) and pull the second step on the cool wavy sloppers (2nd crux). If you fall look around maybe you missed something;).
