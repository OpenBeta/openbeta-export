FA: Rhys Beaudry and Konstantin Stoletov, July 2020.\n\nProbably one of the most scenic multi-pitch climbs in Alberta. Located in the narrow and steep Peskett Canyon, above the waterfall. Beautiful limestone, insane moves and exposure will make this climb a must-do for anyone who can climb/work these grades!\n\nApproach (30 min from parking lot). Park and approach as for Little Russia. The climb is located on the huge wall that looms above the waterfalls at the back of the canyon (~300 m up the creek from Little Russia). Climb via ferrata and pull 8 m on low angle slab (fixed rope) to the base of the first pitch; 2 bolt belay station, chains (photo). In early season it is recommended to take your bottoms off on approach since you'll have to wade knee-thigh deep for at least a few steps. Shoes are must since broken glass was pulled out of the creek a few times.\n\nClimb\nP1: 20 m, 10 bolts, 5.12a. Clip the first bolt from the deck and pull an awkward move to establish yourself on the slab; nothing but side-pulls and under-clings! Head up and right to the overhang section, pull through it on the left leaning rail of pockets and crimps. Campus/lay-back/toe-hook through it (crux) and finish on technical face to a good ledge belay station (2 bolts, rings).\n\nP2: 30 m, 14 bolts, 5.12c. Look at the monster and breathe in! Climb up and right on parallel horizontal weaknesses to a menacing, rotten flake. Pull the flake (~5.10) and  reach a bullet, steep, yellow streak. Clip from the mono pocket (yes, you read it right, it's your last good hold!) and boulder through the first crux to a no-hands rest on a ledge. Take a moment to look at the slot canyon to your right, and the meandering stream/water falls below. When you're ready, pull into another crazy sequence of side-pulls, dead-points and high-steps, finishing on a short, tricky section of slab crossing back to your left to the belay station (2 bolts).\n\nP3: 7 m, 2 bolts, 5.2. Move your belay left to a big, warm ledge station (3 bolts, rings).\n\nP4: 20 m, 10 bolts, 5.12b. Do you like technical face climbing on a razor sharp limestone? This is for you! Climb up and right on the lichen colored orange wall, traversing under a weakness for the first 3 bolts. Pull the weakness when you can and head back up to your left gaining a good rest. From here, drop the hammer on sustained, technical face climbing until the angle eases off and the rock gets even sharper! Mantle onto a right leaning ledge with a semi hanging belay under the overhang (3 bolts, rings).\n\nP5: 11 m, 7 bolts, 5.11b/c. Maybe THE money pitch (or one of 3-4 money pitches!). Start under the overhang with insane exposure below you. Do an all points off jug to jug dyno (recommended for full experience) or use your technique to climb to it! Continue higher up on a juggy wall full of cool features ending with a technical mantel to belay station (3 bolts, rings). Look around, have you ever been in location like this?\n\nP6: 23 m, 13 bolts, 5.10b/c. Face climbing slightly to the right to the little ledge below a steeper section. Pull through it (crux) onto a low angled wall and finish with some obligatory moss climbing to a wide ledge with big pine trees. Enjoy the crazy views one more time. (2 bolts, rings). \n\nDescent:\nRap from the top of:\nP6 to P5 (23 m)\nP5 to P3 (33 m)* This lands you in the middle of the P3 traverse, pendulum/scramble left to the anchors\nP3 to P1 (28 m)* Again, a little pendulum required to get to the anchors on your right\nP1 to dirt (20-35 m)* 20 m to the anchors where you started (recommended, down climb the fixed line), 35 m to the base of the second ladder (not recommended, very wet)\n\nGear:\n12-13 regular draws, 2 alpine draws (for bolts 2 and 4 on P2)\n70 m rope\nHelmets\n\n \n\n\n\nApproach (30 min from parking lot). Park and approach like for Little Russia. Climb is located on the obvious wall that looms above the waterfalls at the back of the canyon. Climb two sets of ladders and pull 5m on low angle slab (fixed rope) to the base of the first pitch; 2 bolt belay station, chains (photo). It is recommended to take your bottoms off on approach since you will have to wade knee deep at least for a few steps. Shoes are must since broken glass was pulled out of the creek a few times.\n\n \n\nbolts"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"eomxH8KPXfG93BetYf8jAQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.45133,52.11521]}},"createdBy":"J0CRC2dFWt61JRokFMMZFg==","_change":{"user":"J0CRC2dFWt61JRokFMMZFg==","historyId":"6413497df0cf0083295db2e0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:53:17.561Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,507e8fa3-a1c3-5186-86e9-f7323362ceda,dd8e202c-7909-58ac-9eb4-84a4c527f72f,7a89b11f-c28f-5df1-bddc-17ad61ff2301","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Nordegg","Little Russia","Zardoz Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.45133,52.11521]},"bbox":[-116.4520622552879,52.11476033981814,-116.4505977447121,52.11565966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"eomxH8KPXfG93BetYf8jAQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.4520622552879,52.11476033981814],[-116.4505977447121,52.11476033981814],[-116.4505977447121,52.11565966018187],[-116.4520622552879,52.11565966018187],[-116.4520622552879,52.11476033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"The incredibly imposing wall that looms at the end of the canyon (the canyon makes a nearly 90 degree bend and turns into a narrow slot here). Currently this wall has one climb, and one open project. The rock is unbelievably compact, \"Zardoz\" is likely the easiest line up this wall! \n\n\"Zardoz\" follows a series of somewhat obvious weaknesses. The rest of the wall is characteristically blank (incredibly shallow pockets, nearly imaginary crimps, and shallow corners). Serious potential for development at higher grades. \n\nYou are blind to incoming weather, and the canyon is so narrow that a Spot does not get a signal. Very cold down low, and inaccessible in the early season due to snowmelt. Wait until at least July to attempt anything here. \n\nOpen Project: \"Mono for Alexis\", bolted in honour of the late Alexis Rousseau. Starts from ~20 m up the slab from Zardoz.
