The original description is vague, but a recent attempt to climb the route has led to some improvements. Start The first ascent party climbed a third class gully system some distance left of the north ridge, and after bearing right at a fork they reached the edge of the buttress about 10 m above a prominent notch. The same point may be reached more directly by following a smaller gully system that begins about 50 m left of the ridge and goes up to the notch. This start is described below although there is a lot of loose rock lower down. 1-3) 140 m, 5.5 After scrambling up a short distance to the start of the gully, climb past a narrow section and continue more easily into a loose bowl. Move up and right to another narrow section, pass this on the left, and continue to easy ground that leads up to the notch in the ridge. 4) 15 m, 5.7 Make a difficult move up a short wall directly out of the notch to gain slabs that lead to easy ground. Belay in a short corner a little higher (piton). 5) Ignoring retreat slings on the steep ridge above, make a long easy traverse left to an inside corner and follow this to its top. 6-8) 90 m Climb up slabs (5.6), moving right to a nearly vertical gully. Climb out via the left wall of the gully (5.7) and continue to a chimney. Follow the chimney to easier ground. 9-10)90 m Follow gray rock near the north ridge to the top.\n\n\n\nSecond Buttress north ridge\n\nSingle rack, pitons"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"KAvp6wtgWVCpOg2pbIZVWQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.4203,51.08854]}},"createdBy":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA==","_change":{"user":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA==","historyId":"641344bbf0cf0083295d857e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:32:59.880Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,280be9eb-0b60-5950-a93a-0da96c865559","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Second Buttress of Rundle"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.4203,51.08854]},"bbox":[-115.4210158840807,51.08809033981814,-115.41958411591926,51.08898966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"KAvp6wtgWVCpOg2pbIZVWQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.4210158840807,51.08809033981814],[-115.41958411591926,51.08809033981814],[-115.41958411591926,51.08898966018186],[-115.4210158840807,51.08898966018186],[-115.4210158840807,51.08809033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"The rocky peak just west of EEOR above the Nordic Centre in Canmore.
