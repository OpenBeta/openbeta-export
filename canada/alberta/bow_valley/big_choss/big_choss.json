As the name suggests, most of the rock in the field is choss, but the odd high quality boulder can be found here and there.  It can be a bit frustrating the first few times, as navigating the boulder field can be confusing, most areas cannot be seen from another area. \n  \n It is possible to boulder year round; the sun is good during the warmer days in winter, and there are a lot of shaded problems for the hot summer days. \n  \n The potential of this place is barely tapped.  For those willing to look, there are a lot of new boulders waiting for sends, as well as undeveloped lines on existing boulders."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413400ff0cf0083295d53d3","prevHistoryId":"6413400af0cf0083295d5395","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:12:44.690Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:44.687Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
