Usually climbed as one long approach pitch. Climbing is much easier than 5.8, but likely rated as that because of sparse bolting.  Please don't do these pitches unless you plan on climbing the entire route. \n  \n P3, 5.10d - Move left of the chains, then step onto a textured face before tackling the roof. Some tricky route finding for the path of least resistance. Probably the crux pitch.  \n  \n P4, 5.10d - Follow a path of bolts trending right before tackling a large roof with good holds. \n  \n P5, 5.10b - Scramble past soil and left of a tree to reach blue streak in a corner. Beware pulling the lip as much of the rock is loose. \n  \n P6, 5.10d - Traverse left to cryptic climbing on hard to find holds. Pull a final ledge to the anchor!\n\nSee sciatica area.\nP1 - 3 bolts (27m) <br /> P2 - 3 bolts (23m) <br /> P3 - 8 bolts (21m) <br /> P4 - 8 bolts (23m) <br /> P5 - 5 bolts (20m) <br /> P6 - 5 bolts (14m)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"6DeTfAxuVkaDX5K7staC9g==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1566,51.047]}},"createdBy":"sx6VEHZgUi2wTx4eyiLxIA==","_change":{"user":"sx6VEHZgUi2wTx4eyiLxIA==","historyId":"641343acf0cf0083295d7c2e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:28:28.260Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,4cb01c90-8df7-5158-be07-ba1c83ee3c0c,e837937c-0c6e-5646-835f-92bbb2d682f6","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Heart Creek","Sciatica Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1566,51.047]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"6DeTfAxuVkaDX5K7staC9g=="},"content":{"description":"Exposed rock that gets morning and afternoon sun.
