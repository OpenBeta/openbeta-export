There are 6 or so developed areas and most climbs are about 30 meters with most climbs in the 5.9 - 5.11 range. There are a sprinkling of easier climbs in the 5.6 - 5.8 range and a couple of 5.12's at the end of the canyon. Most climbs can be approached in 10 to 20 minutes of easy walking. \n  \n A summer area where climbers start to show up when the last snow melts off the lower elevations.
