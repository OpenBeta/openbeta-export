This continues to the second bolt, after which the climb eases significantly on larger holds and lower angle rock. Consider stick-clipping the first bolt or risking a ground fall. Not recommended for a newer leader not confident at considerably higher grades (first two bolts seem very sandbagged for 5.6)\n\n\n\nThe bolt line immediately in front of the climber approaching Solstice wall from the trail.
