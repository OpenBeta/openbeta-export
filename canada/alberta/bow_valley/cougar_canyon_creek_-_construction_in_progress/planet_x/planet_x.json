Planet 10? Who cares? this incredible place is home to some of the hardest routes in Alberta.\n\nIf you want to crush some incredible lines in Cougar Canyon, this is the place to do it. This area was featured in a short by Jonathan Siegrist\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZAFsFkdqwE\n\nHe describes it as being an area that has no holds and is based on compression. I think he may be correct about this description.\n\nMultiple Open 5.14 projects, a half dozen 5.13 routes and some good lower grades make this a sure place to crush some incredible climbing during the summer. Shade all day and rain proof make it perfect for summers."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134165f0cf0083295d63f2","prevHistoryId":"64134165f0cf0083295d63e8","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":23,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:18:30.256Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:42.759Z","updatedBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw=="}
