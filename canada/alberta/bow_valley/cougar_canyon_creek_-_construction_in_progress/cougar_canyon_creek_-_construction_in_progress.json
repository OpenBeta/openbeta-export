As it is fed by snow run off, getting to the crag in the spring would be OK if there was more of a trail or a bank, but unfortunately the water may be too high. However, if there is still ice and a sunny day, you may be able to get deep into the canyon to climb at one of the sunny cliffs.\n\nDuring the scorching summer months, there are some high quality climbs on Made in the Shade, Planet X or Casino. Planet X has some of the best quality hard climbs in the Bow Valley and is known for being very cold, even in the summer. Sending temps are only limited to how cold you want to go.\n\nThe only guidebook that is in print that has this area completely documented is Derek Galloway's Bow Valley Sport;f=10+50001+50250 which is highly recommended as it is essential for the sport climbing in the valley. Beautiful pages and good descriptions make it a real work of dedication to the valley from one of Canada's hardest climbers. There are also older versions of Sport climbs in the Canadian Rockies;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1440729965&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=john+martin+sport which has cougar documented (and supports J. Martin, one of the prime developers of the area).\n\nWhen you're done, pick up a beer across the street at Cougar Liquor or some snacks at Red Rock Pizza. If you want some breakfast, Summit Cafe has a great coffee, pastries and eggs galore.\n\nAs of 2015, all routes have been added that are known and published in multiple versions of the literature. As some don't get climbed often, do not take all of this as being 100% correct and be careful out there"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413417ef0cf0083295d6516","prevHistoryId":"64134177f0cf0083295d64cf","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":28,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:14:06.013Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:14:07.881Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
