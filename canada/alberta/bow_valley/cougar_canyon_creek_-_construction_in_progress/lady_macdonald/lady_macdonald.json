Gain the trail head and hike until you reach the first step of rock (8 meters), easy 5th class.\n\nKeep following the trail which will meander over rock, scree and dirt until you make it a significant cliff face above you. Work your way downhill for about 20 meters along the cliff's base until you see a right facing crack that marks the start of the easy 5.5 technical pitch.\n\nGear up (or don't if you're confident), place a couple pieces in the crack and gain the ridge, belaying off a small tree on the ridge.\n\nFollow the very exposed ridge past a handful of sparsely spaced bolts (used for guided parties I believe, the climbing here is very easy and you shouldn't need them) until it eases off into hiking again for a bit. Then back onto the ridge with some 5th class moves occasionally up until you make it to the headwall.\n\nAt the headwall rope up if you choose, and follow the left trending line of least resistance up to the top through easy 5th class moves. After this you eventually join up with the Lady Mac scramble on the summit ridge to top out.\n\nDescend via the hiking/scramble trail back to the entrance of Cougar Creek.\n\nTrailhead as described in Lady Macdonald Climbing sub-area\nA handful of smaller cams."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"4cvJFoi8WSqszaUL1pzrOA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.3012,51.10492]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"64134142f0cf0083295d6214","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:18:11.024Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,1caf95b0-2c0d-52d7-b886-203bf425a391,e1cbc916-88bc-592a-accd-a50bd69ceb38","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Cougar Canyon (Creek) - CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS","Lady Macdonald"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.3012,51.10492]},"bbox":[-115.30191613773454,51.10447033981814,-115.30048386226545,51.10536966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"4cvJFoi8WSqszaUL1pzrOA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.30191613773454,51.10447033981814],[-115.30048386226545,51.10447033981814],[-115.30048386226545,51.10536966018187],[-115.30191613773454,51.10536966018187],[-115.30191613773454,51.10447033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the area for where you start the Lady Macdonald East South East ridge alpine route.
