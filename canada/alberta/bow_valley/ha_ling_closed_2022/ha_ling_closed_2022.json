It is very attractive to the everyperson's climber who looks at the 5.6 grade, 11-12 pitches, 1500 ft of climbing, a direct line to the summit, and says \"I'm there.\" However, there is more than what meets the eye to this climb.\n\nA rope, a helmet, and decent sense of routefinding are advisable for this line. There are stray bolts, stray gear, stray anchors to lead you astray.\n\nThis face can gets sun in July and shorts can work. At 10am the route is in full sun.\n\nP1. This is described as 3rd-4th class with optional ropework. I recommend a rope. No pro, low angle, loose rock, 160'. 1 bolt anchor (10y ago). Don't fall.\n\nP2. This continues up with loose rock on ledges, 1 Friend placement, balance required, 160'. 2 bolt anchor. \"Loose as sin\" is what my notes say. Don't fall! My buddy did, but fortunately it was following.\n\nP3. Pretty much straight up to a 3 bolts belay. Much more solid rock. Route finding apparently can be challenging on this pitch.\n\nP4. Go up and right to a shaded, right-facing corner/groove. A belay that we used is up and right from the top of the groove. 3 bolt belay. There is another, bolted belay to the left that we didn't use. 5.2.\n\nP5. This is a tricky pitch for route finding (probably the crux of route finding). Don't go up and right (that felt 5.8+ R before I downclimbed)! We went down, then traverse left to a ledge, curve up to a groove, to a 2 bolt belay on a ledge.\n\nP6. Angle right, continue past quite a few bolts &amp; pins, go up to a ledge. This may be the crux pitch. 40m, 5.6.\n\nP7. Go up ~7m, then go left, get up under a small roof, continue up to a 2 bolt belay. My notes suggest you may pass a bolt &amp; 3 pins.\n\nP8. Traverse up and right, then go up the right side of a rib, finish in a small, left-facing corner to a 2 bolt belay. 5.5.\n\nP9. Go up a nice, left-facing corner/slab, pass 3 pins, belay at a 2 bolt belay. This is probably the nicest pitch, IMHO. It is easier than it looks. This pitch is in the shade in the afternoon. This sweet photo shows climbing left of the dihedral, although I recall climbing closer to the dihedral at points. 5.5.\n\nP10. Go up and left to a 3 crack corner. This pitch is in the shade in the afternoon. Not quite as nice as P9. 160'.\n\nP11. Take the climb to the top and topout. The last pitch is runout 40+ feet with absolutely no pro placements. Super easy climbing but extremely run out.\n\nWe burned about 5 1/2 hours on a casual stroll up getting lost once. Speedier climbers could half that easily.\n\nDescent: slip down the back side on the scree. Alternatively, I've heard you may be able to rap Sisyphus Summits, but we didn't do that.\n\nNote, this climb has taken out a decent number of climbers, so keep your guard up.\n\nPer Richard Hunter: the name used in more recent guidebooks seems to have changed to NE Face.\n\n\nThis is the obvious prow up the less-than-vertical NE face.  From a distance, the line is obvious, but up close, you can find yourself a bit challenged with the line.  Scope it.\n\nA set of wires, a set of cams to #4 Friend, 10-12 runners, and a 50m rope works.\n\nYou can totally get away with cams up to size #2.

I spotted this obvious line in the winter and thought it looked wild, it resembles a lightning bolt. We did it car to car in 3 hours and used no bolts. The belays are not fixed but are easy to find and build. The route takes an obvious ramp, 7 pitches, to another leftward ramp, 2 pitches, to a final rightward ramp, 3 pitches. The crux pitches are 5 &amp; 6. They are slightly runout but typical to the more traditional routes in the area. The rock on pitch 5, the Chimney, is a little dodgy off the belay but well protected. the crux comes on the run out face climbing right of the chimney, the chimney looked loose and no fun. The next pitch, The Fin, has an awesome position and fun climbing. The left ramp, The Sidewalk, is easy climbing and fast. The upper ramp out right climbs fast and is super fun. Overall the climbing is easy, fun and the rock is bulletproof. Many escapes are possible if weather pisses out.

The climb ascends the steep wall directly below this dihedral. It was originally called simply The North Face Route but the name has been changed to an early suggestion to avoid confusion with more recent climbs. The first ascent, which was completed between frequent rain showers, took three days and followed a direct line involving some sections of aid. These were avoided on the second ascent by climbing an essentially free line to the left in the middle section of the face. This Left Variation allows the route to be climbed free at 5.9 and this a worthwhile outing that can be completed in a day. The original line has recently been retrofitted and freeclimbed at 5.11d and is described below as the Direct Route. On the crux sixth pitch, four bolts were hand-placed on lead to back up the four already there. Also, one bolt was added to each of belays 1, 2, 4 and 5 (belays 3, 6, 7 and 8 could also use an additional bolt). The old bolts appear to be in reasonable shape but have small carabiner holes. While the harder sections are well-protected on good rock, this remains a “traditional” climb. In particular, a small selection of pitons is recommended for protection and belays. The first two pitches are quite loose but the rock becomes much better higher up \n  \n Start directly below the upper dihedral, scramble up and then right on ledges to below a right facing corner 10 m up, with steep slabs on the right. \n  \n 1) 45 m, 5.7 Go up a small, left-facing corner for a few metres, then step up into the right-facing corner mentioned above. Climb up and diagonally right across the slabs to a left-facing corner high up. Follow the corner to a ledge (bolt belay). \n  \n 2) 50 m, 5.8 Follow loose ramps up and left past a piton to a short right-facing corner. Climb the corner for a few metres, move right and then back left on broken rock to a ledge (bolt and optional belay). Traverse along the ledge to its left end (bolt and piton belay). \n  \n 3) 30 m, 5.9 Climb a steep crack in good rock for about 10 m to a small roof (piton). Traverse steeply right to a right-facing corner (piton), climb it for a few metres to below another small roof, and then move right again to a shallow groove (piton). Follow the groove to a \n small ledge with a bolt belay. \n  \n 4) 25 m, 5.9 Climb a steep ramp up and left for 5 m, traverse 5 m left past a piton, step up onto a small slab and then move left to a groove (bolt). Climb the groove past a bulge to a ledge on the left (bolt belay). \n  \n 5) 45 m, 5.7 Follow the corner system above, moving right near the top, to a good ledge and bolt belay. \n  \n Left Variation (F.F.A.: Left Variation: D. Morgan &amp; C. Perry, August 1983): \n  \n 6) 40 m, 5.9 Move across to the far left end of the ledge and make a difficult traverse left beneath an overhang (usually wet). Move up to a ledge and optional belay. Continue up and then left to the base of a corner system. \n  \n 7) 45 m, 5.9 Climb to the top of the corner and small ledges on the left. \n  \n 8) 45 m, 5.9 Move right and climb a steep wall to a shallow corner (piton). Follow the corner for a short distance, then climb left and up to a good ledge. Continue to a large ledge higher up. \n  \n 9) 50 m, 5.7 Make a long traverse down and right, then climb slabs to a good ledge (junction with the original route). \n  \n 10) 30 m, 5.7 Climb the steep corner above the ledge to the base of the upper dihedral. \n  \n 11-13) 140 m, 5.5 Climb slabs and corners on the right side of the dihedral finishing well out on the right. \n  \n Direct (Original) Route: \n  \n 6) 50 m, 5.11d From the far right end of the ledge, climb a groove for 5 m to an overlap, then traverse left and up to a small pedestal (this point may also be reached by climbing broken rock farther left). Traverse up and right on excellent rock to a small niche directly above \n the belay (run-out 5.8). Climb up past three bolts to an awkward lip. Pull over this using a mono pocket (5.11b) and step over the overlap above to a rest stance. Move left to the first of the next four bolts. Climb the increasingly difficult groove above (5.11d) to reach \n the base of a large slab. Climb up past another bolt, trend left and then go back right toa ledge below a large corner (bolt belay). \n  \n 7) 35 m, 5.10d From the right side of the ledge, climb up past three bolts to a thin crack. Make a few strenuous moves up the crack and then stretch right to a jug. Follow a groove that slants back left to the main corner.

Lawrence Grassi in Kananaskis Provincial Park. It is between Thre Sisters and Mt. Rundle. The prominent N and NE faces call out to you to be climbed.\n\nThe peak itself is 7900 feet (2408m) high, with a 2400 foot (740m) elevation gain. The rock is coarse limestone, definitely loose in places. The exposure is quite nice. It can be a great place during a warm summer.\n\nFor the history buffs, the names for this peak supposedly date back to the 1880s when a bet was placed. Supposedly, Ha Ling, a railroad worker won a bet by making a round trip from Bow Valley in 5 1/2 hours. Now, some controversy is that Lee Poon actually did the ascent and won the $10 bet. Weird, one website says $50, that would have been a lot in those days. The peak was renamed in perhaps a revisionistic PC sort of way. The peak was renamed officially in 1997 after local activism and government response.\n\nFor rock climbers, there are both traditional and sport climbs here on the 550m (1650ft) face. Once, the 21-pitch (all 1/2 rope or less), 5.10+ N face route, Sisyphus Summits, was quite controversial. This was once possibly the longest sport climb in North America. The low-end difficulty NE Ridge attracts many due to its pleasant exposure and apparent ease of ascent, but beware, the route has some hazards. Check out the Alpine Club Canada site for a few details on 4 injuries &amp; 3 deaths.\n\nMap of the area.\n\nPhoto of peak from approach. Photo closer to the face.
