Blue streaked, blocky, and pavement grey limestone buttresses are tucked away in the quiet trees. You can almost ignore the semis engine braking their way into Canmore.\n\n\"Ace\" is an incredible crag with great climbing from 12- to 14+. If you are climbing at the grade, this is a must visit. It gets shade all day, so can be quite chilly. The routes range in height from 15m to close to 35m.\n\nThere are two distinct sectors, the Upper and Lower walls. The Upper wall generally has harder routes that are shorter and more intense. The Lower wall has some incredible power endurance climbs on the left side, and in general more variety in rock quality and flavor.\n\nIn general, I have felt the grades at Acéphale stiff and the rock hard on your skin, compared to other crags in the Bow Valley. Prepare thy tips for battle."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64133f7cf0cf0083295d4e22","prevHistoryId":"64133f62f0cf0083295d4c91","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:10:07.451Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:10:09.312Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
