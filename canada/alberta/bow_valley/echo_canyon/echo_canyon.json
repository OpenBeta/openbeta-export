The canyon is visible from the road (you can see a huge left facing corner from the cougar canyon approach). They succeeded as it is incredible. Only a few other areas have the consistency of quality and stone which is obvious in Echo.  \n  \n Now quite popular with both the Canmore and the Calgary crowd, on any given weekend the lookout and the hideaway may have a ton of people sweating in the sun. The best time of year is fall where the sun is less powerful and the stone is still warm (unless you go to the notch, where summer is the only season)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134245f0cf0083295d6d5a","prevHistoryId":"64134241f0cf0083295d6d21","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:19:33.459Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:19:35.374Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
