Very good rock, a number of people are working on the \"shield\" which are routes in the obvious shield near the top of the cliff. \n  \n A note for people who think this is a good idea to climb here in sunny weather: It really isn't a summer crag. The lookout (lower) offers almost no shade and is baking in the scree. You will arrive here with your water and instantly get sizzled during warm summer days. Better places to visit are Acephale, Lake Louise, The notch and other shady venues for summer. \n  \n As for those who choose to go at it during the early and late season, smaller crowds and better conditions will reward you. Good on you for choosing the right cliff!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134200f0cf0083295d6b9e","prevHistoryId":"641341fff0cf0083295d6b94","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":23,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:21:03.327Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:21:20.204Z","updatedBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw=="}
