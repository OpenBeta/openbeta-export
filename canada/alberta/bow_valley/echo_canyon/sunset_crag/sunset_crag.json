A trail can be found on the east side of the creek (behind the large boulder in the trees) from where the Lookout trail heads up the other way (west). \n  \n The crag comes into the sun in the late afternoon (4-5pm depending on time of year) and is a nice compliment to the routes at the Hideaway. Good for a warm up/down from the Hideaway, chasing the sun or shade, or an after work session. \n  \n Most routes are 5.10 or easy 5.11 with a greater variety of easier climbing than most other crags currently in Echo Canyon. The clean grey rock is very solid and riddled with features. The crag is capped by a yellow roof with a few \n token pockets and tufas. This keeps the crag reasonably dry during light rain. Most routes dry very quickly. \n  \n A standard set of quick draws and a 60m rope is all you need. Most routes are only ~20-25m high. \n  \n Trail and staging areas are a work in progress."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134244f0cf0083295d6d50","prevHistoryId":"64134244f0cf0083295d6d46","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:22:25.240Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:30.319Z","updatedBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw=="}
