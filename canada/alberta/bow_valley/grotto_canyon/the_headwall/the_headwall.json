WEAR A HELMET, when I did this a hold blew on me on the 3rd pitch and a rock hit my belayer right on the helmet, leaving a mark. \n\nP1 (5.9, 32 meters) - Start pretty much right in the creek on steep moves that don't let up for about half the pitch, eventually gaining easier climbing as you get into a right facing corner and then move left out of it. Continue up and then right onto a large ledge with a tree on it and a 2 bolt anchor.\n\nP2 (5.10a, 24 meters) - Move left from the belay, and follow the bolt line up some hard moves initially on amazing, sticky rock. By far the best pitch of the climb. Finish by gaining another ledge to a bolted belay and be careful of loose rocks.\n\nP3 (5.10b, 26 meters) - Move right from the belay and clip an easy bolt from a broken right trending corner. Get onto the face and pull the crux moves (be aware of loose/weak rock, had a hold explode in my hand) and continue up on thin moves. There is a large run out between the 5th and 6th bolt but it is very easy climbing there. Finish on a tiny ledge with a bolted belay.\n\nDescent: Rappel the way you came, make sure you have a 70 meter rope as a 60 meter willÂ  not make the final rappel.\n\nThe right most bolt line on The Headwall.\n12 bolts on the longest pitch, and bolted anchors with rap rings at every station."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"HeeffDk1Wb+HZA4djcKSUw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.14792,51.07734]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"641342c8f0cf0083295d7319","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:24:40.581Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,0f285ce2-cf61-5e34-82e2-57693fdd0fca,1de79f7c-3935-59bf-8764-0e1d8dc29253","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Grotto Canyon","The Headwall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.14792,51.07734]},"bbox":[-115.14863571077929,51.076890339818135,-115.14720428922068,51.077789660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"HeeffDk1Wb+HZA4djcKSUw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.14863571077929,51.076890339818135],[-115.14720428922068,51.076890339818135],[-115.14720428922068,51.077789660181864],[-115.14863571077929,51.077789660181864],[-115.14863571077929,51.076890339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"The Headwall is located right at the main T Intersection found in Grotto Canyon, where Grotto falls is on the right and The Narrows splits off left.
