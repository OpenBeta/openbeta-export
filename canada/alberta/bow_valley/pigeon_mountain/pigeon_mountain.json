We camped in winter weather and aided up the wall, freeing things where possible. We invited Will Gadd to free it after three winters. Someone attempted the ice/rock line to the left before we arrived. An old fixed rope was visible.\n\nThe Jimmy Skid Rig is nearly 100% natural, but some features were drilled in the crux pitch, which was at the time a longer M11/12 pitch. Anchors were added to break up the pitch after the FFA. It was repeated by Raphael Slawinski in 2012. And then by Jedrzej Jablonski ( instagram.com/p/CAo6zNHjwpw/) in 2020 after a few seasons of projecting. He said, \"Thinking whether linking an awesome natural M9+ pitch and steep WI5+ ice with a chipped, but fun M10+ was worth it there could only be one answer - totally worth it.\" Jablonski's beta:\n\nP1 25m - WI5 (judging by the existence of bolts on this pitch it isn't always all ice) [note: on the FA it was M5 WI5]\n\nP2 25m - M5+ WI5\n\nP3 10m - M3 (exactly one move requires using hands) [note: traverse right in a cave]\n\nP4 15m - M9+ (beautiful)\n\nP5 25m - M10+ (with the right beta, if you miss some tiny footholds at the end it feels more like M11+)\n\nP6 15m - M9 (surprisingly long moves)\n\nP7 40m - WI5+ (steep beauty)\n\n[Note: on the FFA, Gadd linked p 1,2 and 3 (WI5 M5+ 60m) and p 5, 6 and 7 (WI5+ M11/12 70m). Future repeats have broken the pitch up with the addition of new anchors. Gadd climbed it in 2 long pitches and one short - pitch 4]\n\nRappelling: Back clip and clean. Steep!!\n\nIt's named after my power drill, which I called Jimmy. It was a Hilti TE-10A that I had wired into an extension cord that I ran to a pack with three motorcycle batteries. It was a total skid rig.\n\n\n\nHike up McGillivray Canyon and continue through the forest until you can see the route. Hike up the scree slope. Time depends on snow conditions. In deep snow, expect 2/3 hours. In low snow or with a trail, it's been done in 1.5 hours.\n\n\nMulti-pitch mixed rack with sport draws and screws. Bring 2 70-metre ropes\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"MC0332G1WkSkSYvguy5orQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.17563,51.03371]}},"createdBy":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA==","_change":{"user":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA==","historyId":"64134427f0cf0083295d80c6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:30:31.829Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,302d37df-61b5-5a44-a449-8be0bb2e68ad","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Pigeon Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.17563,51.03371]},"bbox":[-115.17634503673705,51.033260339818135,-115.17491496326298,51.03415966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"MC0332G1WkSkSYvguy5orQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.17634503673705,51.033260339818135],[-115.17491496326298,51.033260339818135],[-115.17491496326298,51.03415966018186],[-115.17634503673705,51.03415966018186],[-115.17634503673705,51.033260339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"Several rock, ice and mixed climbs can be found on this peak."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134427f0cf0083295d80c6","prevHistoryId":"64134425f0cf0083295d80c0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:30:27.508Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:31.562Z","updatedBy":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA=="}
