Awesome position.\n\nPitch 1 5.3 50M Follow vague corner (gear) up the ridge to tree. MOVE BELAY up about 15 meters to base of next good feature and belay from tree. \n\nPitch 2 5.5 40M Follow cracks and corners around edge of slab trending left to bolted station behind tree at base of steeper feature. \n\nPitch 3 5.7 45M 3 bolts Follow a shallow left­facing crack to a traverse. Step right into a corner (bolt) and follow features until you can traverse back left through a break. Follow good features up to a bolted station in protected alcove. \n\nPitch 4 5.8 50M 6 bolts Step left off the belay. Clip bolts to a loose roof up and left. Fun moves around left side into shallow, broken crack. Step back right and traverse slab (2 bolts) underneath several roofs to a steep corner feature (bolt). Awkward move to easier ground (up right groove) then back left to a bolted belay on a ledge. \n\nPitch 5 5.10a or 5.8 A0 45M 8 bolts Step right off the belay and move up to a bolt. Step left into the main corner (exposure down and left). Climb up past bolt and then either head straight up for the bolted face (5.10a or 5.8 A0), or head left through some loose rock (5.8) to a gear belay. \n\nPitch 6 30M 3rd class. 30m to top of route and rap station.\n\nRap route with double 60M ropes. At bolted station on top (5m skiers right of obvious summit cairn), rappel directly down 30M to belay as for pitch 5. From here rap all previous stations to the top of pitch 2 (wide good ledge). Then rappel 50m down and left to a station below an orange roof. From here is 40m to the ground. \n\nNot all stations are equipped with fixed rings (we ran out) so bring some cord and mallions in case the rodents have been busy.  \n\nPhoto topo:  topos.tabvar.org/sites/defa…\n\n\n\nUp the centre of the buttress.\n\nSingle rack to #4 including a set of micro cams. 12 draws at least 8 extendable. Double ropes required for rappel."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"lo9PjHgrVyu1FBP8YTtBVw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.17086,51.03829]}},"createdBy":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA==","_change":{"user":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA==","historyId":"64134250f0cf0083295d6db5","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:22:40.785Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,968f4f8c-782b-572b-b514-13fc613b4157","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Gobi Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.17086,51.03829]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"lo9PjHgrVyu1FBP8YTtBVw=="},"content":{"description":"Buttress on the NNE side of Mount McGillivray"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134250f0cf0083295d6db5","prevHistoryId":"6413424ff0cf0083295d6daf","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:22:38.044Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:22:40.792Z","updatedBy":"EIy2Cw+gWv2EmxHDuBhQbA=="}
