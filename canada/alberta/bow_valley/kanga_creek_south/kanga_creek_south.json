It climbs some great rock but as a new-ish route there is still some loose rock so like any rockies climbs a helmet is strongly recommended. The route can be done with 10 quickdraws and a 70 meter rope although might be possible with a 60 meter as all pitches are just about 30 meters.\n\nAs mentioned above, helmets are a must but please be careful not to throw any rocks down on the road below.\n\nP1: 5.7, 10 bolts. This pitch starts next to a tree and follows an arrete until you get to a comfortable belay ledge. The tree at the end of the pitch is good to grab.\n\nP2: 5.9, 6 bolts. The crux pitch, follow a leftward line of bolts to a small roof, around the arrete to a few exposed moves on a slab. Once over the ledge, walk to the anchor.\n\nP3: 5.8, 8 bolts. Start up a sweet right facing corner onto some face climbing. You'll reach a steep bulge eventually, at this point clip the bolt and trend left for some more fun climbing. Mantle to belay ledge.\n\nP4: 5.9, 10 bolts. Arguably the best rock of this climb. Pass some trees (right or left doesn't matter) to a corner slab. Stay left of bolts until stem move that leads you into thin slab climbing to belay ledge.\n\nDescent: 4 30 meter rappels. For the third rappel, aim to rappel straight down the chimney instead of around the crux arrete. Be careful of falling rock when pulling the rope.null\n\nThis is the leftmost route at the crag. Same approach as for hot fuzz &amp; sharknado, but once at the base of these climbs head left on a trail that brings you to a tree in a corner. Use photo for reference. \n10 quickdraws, 70 meter rope, helmets.
