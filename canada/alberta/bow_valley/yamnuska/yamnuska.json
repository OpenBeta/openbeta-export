Ranging from 5.5 to 5.14-including 30m sportish climbs to 350m trad testpieces. There are a few sport routes but most have trad gear requirements. The cliff is home to traditional climbing in the Canadian Rockies so expect a little adventure on most routes. Its southern exposure allows for a long climbing season. It can be climbed in the middle of winter but don't be surprised if you get snowed on in the middle of August either. As with most of the Rockies the rock is limestone, which is a mixed bag. Though generally the rock is good and excellent in places. For more information refer to \"Yamnuska Rock\" by Andy Genereux.\nIf you want adventure climbing you will find it here!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134511f0cf0083295d8873","prevHistoryId":"6413450ef0cf0083295d8862","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":11,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:33:32.987Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:44.969Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
