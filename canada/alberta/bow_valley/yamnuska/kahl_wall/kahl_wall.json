Mackaw, Oct. 1964","length":309,"content":{"description":"Length: 310m, 9 pitches \n Sun Exposure: receives sun, parts of the corner will provide shade \n Time: 4 - 8 hours to climb the route \n car-to-car: 7 - 11 hours \n Difficulty: 5.9 (or 5.10a) \n Rack: Cams: doubles of micro to 3\" (#3 camalot), single #4 usefull, but not entirely necessary, normal selection of nuts. \n  \n A classic route (originally named Verboten Corner) with some of the best climbing at the grade in the Rockies. A little routefinding, runout climbing (P1 &amp; P6), and exciting/memorable moments make this route a classic. Generally good gear and great rock with some VERY exciting sections (P9). All the pins were fixed and good in July of 2011. \n  \n Several direct variations exist that bump the grade to 5.10a with good pro and straighten the initial pitches out a bit.  The first 4 pitches are just superb climbing, while the final pitches offer varied excitement. \n  \n P0: Solo up a short 5.0 section for a about 5m to gain the good ledge with a tree to start belaying. Don't link into P1 or ropedrag will be terrible. \n  \n P1 5.8R 45m: Head up and left, place some pro, then climb somewhat runout climbing up and right towards the forbidden corner and a 2 bolt belay. \n  \n P2 5.8: Straight up a left facing corner and crack with some smallish face cracks as well. Head over some ledges past a first pin belay to a second pin belay.  \n  \n P2 variation 5.10a 55m: If doing the 5.10a variation, keep heading straight up the Forbidden Corner further past the 2nd pin belay and past a 3rd pin nest belay (w/ slung chockstone) and 20' above that is a nice 3 bolt anchor. The 5.10a moves are right below the bolted belay and well protected with the crack on the face. There is a hidden bolt right above where the face crack ends to protect the stepover moves to the bolted semi-hanging belay. \n  \n P3 variation 5.10a 50m: From the bolted belay at the end of the P2 variation, head straight up past some pins (physical 5.10a, good pro), bypass the P3 anchors and go right on up P4. \n  \n P3 5.9 30m: Move up 3m and traverse right on the wall up and across at the flake. A short corner takes you back left to the Forbidden Corner. \n  \n P4 5.8 35m: Keep going up the Forbidden Corner past a small roof and head out onto the face (pin and good crack) for 5.8 or stay in the corner for physical old school 5.8 (good pro). \n  \n P5 5.6 25m: Walk left to the large pinnacle (usually with tat slings around it) clip the slings and traverse around the pinnacle on the lower outer face (somewhat loose). Belay on a nice ledge with 2 bolts. Don't link P6 as it is runout slab climbing! \n  \n P6 5.6R &amp; 5.8 35m: 5.6R version - Head out left to a pin and some pro in a crack then head up 12m with no pro friction climbing to a horizontal crack and traverse left to an obvious weakness. Climb this right facing dihedral (5.8) with good pro to a 2 bolt anchor. Alternatively, instead of heading up the slab, there might be better pro to stay right in the corner (immediately left off the belay) and head up to the horizontal crack, then traverse left to the obvious 5.8 corner. \n  \n P7 5.8 PG13 25m: Head up the left facing corner off the belay to a pin and a good cam placement. Head hard right immediately at the small roof (awkward) to a shoebox stance. Climb up right onto the semi-detached large block. Don't get suckered in by heading straight up and following false pins that just head up the broken terrible corner. The detached flake/block on the right has a good pin at the top of it and some knotted old long piece of tat hanging from something unknown above. Tat is certainly older than 2006. Probably from someone off route trying to regain the traverse. Clip the tat and traverse hard right across positive holds, clip some pins, and arrive at a nice 2 bolt anchor. \n  \n P8 5.9 PG13 50m+: This pitch looks completely improbable, but is actually not to hard. WATCH ROPE DRAG, you'll make a giant reversed \"C\" shape on this pitch. Climb down right to make a tough/exciting move around a corner to the big pinnacle. Climb the pinnacle and clip the 2 pins above it for your second (also takes cams). Be mindful of ropework here and don't screw your partner. Can place the #4 camalot on lead, but then backclean after clipping the top pins.  Downclimb the other side of the pinnacle for a few moves and make an improbable traverse right on good holds. Climb a weakness onto the face and clip an old shitty bolt (needs to be replaced, semi-hidden). Head up right into the weakness slot and clip a few pins. When a ledge is gained, traverse hard hard hard left (5.easy) till you're back over the belay. Build a gear belay below an easy 5.7 right facing exit dihedral. \n  \n P9 5.7: Climb the right facing dihedral and face to the summit. Be mindful of loose rock at the exit as it funnels right to the belayer.\n\nWalkoff the normal east end descent.\nAlmost all bolted anchors except the last pitch. Lots of fixed pins. Bring a good selection of cams from small to 3.5\" (a single #4 camalot is nice). Some nuts and lots of runners."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ahpO0Ma6VTqET8KbFwVM/A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","_change":{"user":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","historyId":"64134501f0cf0083295d87ce","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:34:09.771Z"},{"_id":"CVkd6YHyTaGrPQaRKaNb6A==","name":"Kahl of the Dawn","grades":{"yds":"5.11d"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","length":394,"content":{"description":"This is a linkup of Bringers of the Dawn and the Khal Wall. You can climb this route at a grade of 5.10a or 5.11c/d depending on which pitches you choose to climb. Generally by staying on the right you will climb the easier pitches. All of the anchors are bolted.\n\nPitch 1 5.4 35m\n\nClimb up and easy but loose corner system until you can leave the choss and find a few bolted stations. You can't easily link these two pitches due to the traversing nature of the second pitch.\n\nPitch 2 5.6 30m\n\nClimb diagonally left through a face, it is tempting to traverse but it takes you to more difficult terrain. Find the hidden holds and traverse across at 5.6 to a bolted anchor.\n\nPitch 3 5.8 35m\n\nThe crack will weave to the left and then to the right on a rising traverse. Jam and chimney to a piton, ledge and then the anchor.\n\nPitch 4 5.7 50m\n\nEnter the chimney and remain calm as you won't get any protection for 15 meter. Plug some gear at the top and then escape to a ledge. Traverse directly right until you see trees, the anchor is next to the trees.\n\nNOTE: This ledge is a dividing point in the route with the next two pitches on the right being 5.8 and 5.10a while the pitches on the left are 5.10c and 5.10d.\n\nPitch 5 (left) 5.10c 40m\n\nClimb through steep terrain and a committing flake and then into a corner system.\n\nPitch 6 (left) 5.10d 30m\n\nStay in the corner system and then trend right through quixotic terrain. Stop at the ledges above for your next station.\n\nNOTE: The anchors here split again with the right being the easier finish at 5.10a, 5.8, and 5.9. The pitches on the left are 5.11c/d, 5.10c, 5.10b.\n\nPitch 7 (left) 5.11c/d 35m\n\nClimb left under a flake system that then into a roof. Stem your way through the roof and make a desperate clip for a bolt just above it. Climb above traversing between different holds and while staying to the right of a large alcove. The anchors should be above you while the anchors about 10 meters to the right are for the right variation.\n\nPitch 8 (left) 5.10c 45m\n\nMeander up the face climb searching for which holds will unlock the way. Eventually you will reach an anchor shortly before the rock decomposes.\n\nPitch 9 (left) 5.10b 50m\n\nClimb up through easier terrain and then left taking you to the only clean rock in the area. \n\nWalk off the top.   \n\nThe first route you reach from the approach trail.\nSingle set of cams from Purple Metolius to #3.

Doyle 1981","length":258,"content":{"description":"\nExcellent and varied climb that felt very solid (I assume due to lots of traffic - but not too much as the limestone has not been polished smooth yet). Kahl Wall tends to wander about so route finding is a challenge. Most of the climbing is moderate so you don't have to be a solid 5.10 climber. The crux pitch is very sustained and much harder then any other pitch on the route, but it is extremely well protected with lots of bolts and occasional gear placements so that no matter what one could get past this pitch.\n\nP1 - 35m, 5.4 - Mostly an approach pitch. Scramble up 5m to sloping ledge with tree. Climb steeper corner above on right (5.4) to a ledge system. Traverse left on ledges to many belay stations, use the one farthest left.\n\nP2 - 35m, 5.6 - Climb up a few meters in a a corner. At the bolt go STRAIGHT HORIZONTAL left (it is very tempting to keep going up in the larger crack but if you place a cam you're already too high). After a few meters left on a 2nd ledge (optional belay anchors), climb diagonal up-left to another ledge, traverse it straight left till the end to base of a corner and belay here. This pitch is more horizontal then vertical.\n\nP3 - 40m, 5.7 - Up corner to ledge. Move right to another corner and up this to another ledge. Traverse right to wide crack and up this to a belay on the right.\n\nP4 - 45m, 5.7 - Up to a ledge below a flaring chimney. Up this and near top before you reach the roof, exit right onto ledges. There should be a pin here to protect the 2nd as you now make a long traverse right. At end of traverse step down and across a depression, climb a short corner to ledge. Keep traversing right to a fixed belay.\n\nP5 - 30m, 5.8 - From right side of belay, move up to large corner and climb this to a bolt and pin on right. Move right here (5.8) to a left-facing corner. Up this to ledge and move right to a belay.\n\nP6 - 35m, 5.10b - Fantastic pitch! Lots of fixed pro so you can concentrate on the sustained, thin face climbing required. Move up to flake and move right around it (1st crux) into tiny corner and continue up steep face to ledge (2nd crux). Climb the corner above you till it becomes featureless, at which point step right to a slabby face, move up it to a roof and then step back left into the corner you had exited below. Continue up corner to fixed belay.\n\nP7 - 30m, 5.9 - Climb corner above for 15' or so and then step right into groove and then step right again to easier ledges. Climb up and right past a pin and right some more to base of slab. Excellent climbing up this slab past fixed gear leads to a belay beneath the huge exit corner (easily seen from the base of the climb).\n\nP8 - 45m, 5.8 - Up the corner. Crux is moving left when you reach a roof. Easier if you stay in the chimney as you move around roof as opposed to just using the main wall.\n\nP9 - 20m, 5.8 - Finish up the corner which requires your 4\" cam to minimally protect. Turn the roof at the top of the corner and easier climbing leads to the top. Lots and lots of loose rocks on top so be very careful as you belay up the second.\n\nDescent - head down on a myriad of trails toward east end of Yam and back along base back to you packs.\n\n\nAfter reaching the base of the cliff from the approach trail, traverse right 60 or so ft and move up to base of cliff at a group of small trees beneath an easy corner/ramp that leads left. You should be able to see a prominent left-facing corner at the top of the cliff above and a little right of you. This corner is the last 2 pitches of Kahl Wall.\nLike all routes at Yam, I recommend using double ropes and wearing a helmet.  You will find plenty of fixed gear on this climb but nevertheless you need a standard rack up to a 4\" cam."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ahpO0Ma6VTqET8KbFwVM/A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"rJYh9SHmVLK9qbPjTNSQEg==","_change":{"user":"rJYh9SHmVLK9qbPjTNSQEg==","historyId":"64134502f0cf0083295d87e2","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:34:10.832Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,3a1a6f6f-d454-572b-a83c-d7ca7caa45ad,6a1a4ed0-c6ba-553a-844f-c29b17054cfc","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Yamnuska","Kahl Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]},"bbox":[-115.11921643039805,51.12335033981814,-115.11778356960193,51.12424966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"ahpO0Ma6VTqET8KbFwVM/A=="},"content":{"description":"This area is home to some of the best rock on the cliff.
