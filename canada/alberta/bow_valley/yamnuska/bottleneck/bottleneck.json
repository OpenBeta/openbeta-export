Most of the fixed piton belays have been removed, all protection and way-finding pitons are still in place but can mostly be backed up. A new bolt now protects the hardest moves on P3.\n\nPitch 1 (10a): described elsewhere this pitch is 55-60+ meters. there are now two new bolted belays 25m and 30m into this first pitch (5m apart from each other). This first half is straightforward and easy. The second half sports sustained 5.9 climbing with moves of 10a. Gear on the ledge at the top to belay.\n\n\n\nPitch 2 (5.6): step a few meters down and left. Traverse to the base of a large chimney formed by a detached pillar on the left and the wall on the right with a large chockstone at its top. Stem easily to the top of this chockstone to belay off gear in a corner/crack in the steep wall.\n\nPitch 3 (5.8+): make a few moves up to clip a hard to reach bolt. Make the hardest moves at/above this bolt to get good gear in on the right. At the top of the crack take the easier corner up and left to reach the base of slabby wall. Belay off gear and a fixed pin. Poorly placed and un-necassary bolt with missing hanger here.  \n\nPitch 4 (5.8 PG13):  Climb up and right on good prickle rock past past a couple spacious fixed pieces and some small gear until at a small ledge. Go left at the ledge and into a short yellow/orange corner crack with some pro and a small overhang to another small ledge. Traverse right from this small ledge to clip a piton, then climb straight up to finish the steep climbing. Continue up and left on easier ground until at a fixed piton on the left at a fairly major intersection. Continuing left is the climb Mix Master. Belay here off a piton and gear or continue up and right on blocky low 5th for 10-15m to belay off gear. If continuing up and right be thoughtful of the belays location as there is some loose rock on the next pitch.\n\nPitch 5 (5.7): climb up and right to an obvious intersection. There is a piton up and left from the intersection. When it's possible a ways below this piton, make a few 5.7 moves up, over and right out of this intersection. The top of this is some loose rock that can be navigated with care. scramble up and left for a few more meters to belay off a 2 pin anchor on the left that keeps the belay away from the line of fire in the chimney.\n\nPitch 6 (5.9): chimney up the wide obvious chimney starting at its back, working up and out. Make a few stem moves up to the 'bottleneck' with a sloping ledge on the right. There is a fixed piton far at the back of the chimney here. Climb out right along the ledge to reach the steep crack on the right. Climb this to its top and continue up for another 5-10m on ledges to the base of the chimney and belay off a piton and gear below the roof, keeping the belayer away from below the chimney/line of fire.\n\n\n\nPitch 7 (5.8): climb up the corner and then stem / chimney / squeeze to the top. \n\nLeft side of the grillmairs ledge, first large right facing corner with a roof in it. Can't miss it. \ncams small to 4\" with Doubles 0.4-2 and wires would be most useful. A hammer is recommended but almost all fixed pitons can be backed up with natural pro."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"bW+QdnU5WD++QyobW0TmLw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"Bk+vnP7NWF+JTJZHuI0kuA==","_change":{"user":"Bk+vnP7NWF+JTJZHuI0kuA==","historyId":"641344faf0cf0083295d8795","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:34:02.256Z"},{"_id":"7W85rAglT9ewBoEpqTPx1w==","name":"Grillmair's Chimneys","grades":{"yds":"5.6"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"L.

The first ascent was done by 'accident' using a nylon utility rope and a couple of pins. The first assencionists started scrambling just to see how high they could get, and before they knew it they were roping up for the crux pitch. \n  \n Do not do this route until Yam is free of snow, or else you'll regret it! \n  \n This is a great introductory route on Yam, the route finding is relatively straight forward, and the rock on the difficult sections is fairly strong. \n  \n Pitch 0 (5.0, 20m) - Scramble up the low 4th/5th class rock to the actual start of the route. \n  \n Pitch 1 (5.5, 40m) - Climb up the blocks and ledges to a good belay ledge, good cracks and fixed pins for the belay at a large ledge. \n  \n Pitch 2 (5.6, 30m) - Work your way into a series of chimneys until you emerge on top of a ledge. \n  \n Pitch 3-5 (5.5, 110m) - Follow the weaknesses trending slowly to the left. Several good belay positions exist. Stay in the chimneys rather than on the face where possible, as the face climbing is more difficult. \n  \n Pitch 6 (5.6+, 20m) - Climb up the face along two small cracks or around the corner to the large scree ledge above. Watch out, the climbing is tricky on the face. Belay from the large scree ledge. \n  \n Pitch 7 (5.6 30m) - Climb the broken corner to the slab at the base of the large chimney above. \n  \n Pitch 8 (5.6+ 50m) - Move onto the slab below the chimney protected by 2 fixed pins. Move into the chimney and climb up, following the obvious weaknesses deeper and deeper into the chimney. There is a good reminder of why fixed pins need to be backed up here. Move past a large chock-stone (possible belay) and deeper into the chimney/cave system. The top out is through a small hole at the top of the pitch.\n\nFrom the top of the approach trail walk along Kahl wall until the first major break. Scramble up the low angle crap at the left side of the break and walk along the top of the slab until the wall steepens up; the routes starts up from here.\nStandard Yam Rack, screamers for the many fixed pins.

Gadd et al. dropped in on rap and made it as far as the bottom of P6 before reverting to lead tactics. This route basically goes up the path of least resistance through the steepest section of Yamnuska; imagine putting it up on hooks! \"Yama\" is Japanese for \"mountain\" and \"Bushi\" for monk.\n\nAscent:\n\nP1; 5.10, 50+ m: Locate the bolt line just right of the \"Balrog\" corner. Start up a 4th class ramp to a high first bolt. This pitch is ~50 m from the first bolt to the anchor, add another 10 m or so if you belay from the scree below the ramp. Extend and back clean as much as possible, especially after the midway anchor. \n\nP2; 5.12d, 22 m: Leave the belay to the right, working your way up through a dihedral to a rest below the roof system. No stopper moves, just absolutely blinding pump! Gadd/Genereux had this at 5.12d/13a, perhaps the knee-bar is what gives it the slash grade. \n\nP3; 5.11d, 50 m: Follow the corner/ramp up and left passing one bolt, the next one is just above the corner to the right, watch out for a bit of loose rock. Continue up a corner and traverse under the roof to the left, there is a sizeable run-out to bolt 3, which can be mitigated by a 0.3. Follow the bolts, and when in doubt, go right. When you get into hero territory, keep an eye out for a ledge on your left. This slab pitch is probably more cryptic than hard, but could be the pitch that ruins your redpoint! Extend at least the first 3 bolts, be smart with extending after that. \n\nP4; 5.12b, 35 m: Look for a bolt way up and right on the yellow headwall. Juggy climbing gets you to a no-hands rest below where the wall steepens. Race the pump through the overhanging dihedral-ish feature before gaining a good rest. Follow the bolts to the left under the roof and pull up onto the headwall using a super jug. Head up and right on the immaculate headwall to a hidden belay under the next roof. Extend the draws up to the no-hands. \n\nP5; 5.12b, 19 m: A mean move off the belay get's you to a slot just above the first bolt (left). Pull into the dihedral and follow the bolts up and right. This pitch is something like boulder, rest, boulder, rest, boulder, rest, sustained climbing, absolutely savage move guarding the next belay. The line zig-zags pretty hard, apparently this pitch was more than a bit frightening to bolt and clean! Extend bolt 2.\n\nP6; 5.12b/c, 22 m: Head up and right, traversing under the roof, before cutting back left to skirt yet another roof (and then head right again). Seriously pumpy climbing gets you into an incredible, slightly overhanging yellow/orange dihedral out of sight from the belay. Follow the dihedral to a small roof. Pass the blind boulder problem to get to the last few bolts of victory climbing; head right when you run out of bolts. Extend bolts 2 and 3, back clean where possible on the second rightward traverse. \n\nP7; 5.12b, 37 m: Traverse right and then follow a corner up before traversing right again (extend a couple of draws in here). An endless amount of mini-boulders brings you to a final boulder problem as the rock turns grey. Follow victory buckets up and right when you don't see any more bolts! Gadd gave this pitch a rating of harder than 12a but wasn't sure...that's a fair assessment! Thin, techy, and mean on the skin. \n\nP8; 5.11c, 35 m: Hero climbing gets you to what is possibly the redpoint crux of the entire route - pulling a bulge following a crack like feature. More hero climbing to the anchor!\n\nDescent: A 70 m rope gets you to the top of P3 if you can put up with the necessary clipping and cleaning. Note, the P8 to P7 belay is a rope stretcher, so be careful and be ready to knot block. You'll need a second rope to get down P3, and from the anchors at the top of P2, you can drop 45 m or so plumb to the midway anchor on P1. From the midway anchor it is 30 m or so to the dirt. All anchors have something on them that you can rap off of - slings, biners, tat...some of it could use a bit of love if you have the means! \n\nBelay Beta: Top of...P1, good feet, lean left; P2, good feet, lean left; P3, sit down ledge, a good spot for food and hanging out! P4, awkward, semi-hanging on somewhat small feet; P5, the worst...basically full hanging with a 1x4\" board to try and sit on; P6, little ledge that you can stand no hands on if you lean into the wall, quite nice! P7, not bad, another sort of leaning belay with good feet; P8, sit on the top of a pillar just right of the anchor.\n\nTop Out/Rap In: There is a bonus bolt, maybe 8 m or so above the last belay. Getting there is some combination of a 4th class move and a bit of 2nd class scree, it would be wise to use the bolt to bring up your second! If you're looking to rap in, after you pass the chain on the scramble pick your way to the ridge (easiest if you drop down a bit and pass the little rib before heading up the gully). There's a big, flat slab with a cairn, the bolt is immediately below the cairn. \n\n\n\nLook for the biggest roof system a little climbers' right of the summit; Yamabushi goes through this. Take the standard climbers' trail to the base of the cliff, head left for ~100 m, then head up for the roof system when you see it! \n\n18 draws, 6 of which should be alpines. optional .3. Helmets, 70 m rope and a 50 m tag line."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"bW+QdnU5WD++QyobW0TmLw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"641344fcf0cf0083295d87a9","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:34:04.224Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,3a1a6f6f-d454-572b-a83c-d7ca7caa45ad,6d6f9076-7539-583f-be43-2a1b5b44e62f","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Yamnuska","Bottleneck"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]},"bbox":[-115.11921643039805,51.12335033981814,-115.11778356960193,51.12424966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"bW+QdnU5WD++QyobW0TmLw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.11921643039805,51.12335033981814],[-115.11778356960193,51.12335033981814],[-115.11778356960193,51.12424966018187],[-115.11921643039805,51.12424966018187],[-115.11921643039805,51.12335033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Bottleneck Area is home to a wide range of climbing styles.
