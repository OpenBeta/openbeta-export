Genereux first full sport line (the second sport line on Yam) which he solo bolted- all modern fixe bolts and fixe rap ring belays. Only the P4 (top of p3) belay is semi-hanging- all other belays are on ledges.\n\nP1; 5.11d, 40 m: Pass 2 bolts to gain a small ledge before pulling up into a left leaning open book feature. The crux comes as the feature bends from left leaning to vertical (delicate, technical). Sustained, vertical to slightly overhanging climbing for 15 meters brings you to the lip where you finish out the pitch over much easier, lower angle terrain. End on a dirty ledge. \n\nP2; 5.11b, 40 m: Scramble up and slightly right through stepped terrain to stand on top of a pinnacle. Extend these first 3 draws. Leave the pinnacle to start the climb- steeper terrain, good holds. Follow the bolt line up the right/overhanging stepped roof/corner - get creative with your footwork and side pulls, awesome climbing! You will find yourself at a good rest on a hand rail under a very blank looking roof - extend the draw above you and traverse hard right, staying under the roof, to a no hands rest under the next bolt. Extend this bolt, and continue up over easy, low angle terrain. Head up and left following the bolt line, to belay on a ledge on top of a pinnacle: prudently extend draws as your work back to the left. Note: the belay station is plumb to the top of P1 - in total you traverse probably 6-7 m right, and the same distance back left. \n\nP3; 5.11b, 20 m: Head straight up from the belay ledge. This is the namesake pitch, the rock is incredibly sharp and is known to draw blood! Easy-ish climbing down low, thin face in the middle, and a final crux bulge near the top! Semi-hanging belay. Note, if you don't see bolts nearly straight above the P3 belay, you probably got suckered by the distraction rap rings. Look to your left (5-6 m) for the proper stance. \n\nP4; 5.11c, 30 m: Follow the bolts straight up from the belay, there is definitely a move to gain the first bolt, consider a redirect through your anchor. The second bolt is distant, but easy enough. Thin, pinchy and crimpy vertical climbing for a short section (crux) to lower angle terrain. Cruise on big holds to the final belay ledge under the bulge. \n\nP5; 5.12a/b, 30 m: The first bolt is by the dark smudge a couple of meters directly above the belay. Cut right from the belay, and then back left to gain the face. Clip your second bolt and then launch into the crux bulge, trending left up the sustained corner. Pull out onto easier terrain and cruise for the lip (right bolt line)!\nRap: 2x60m ropes required. Rap from the top of: P5-P3, P3-P1, P1-Dirt. Some shenanigans required if you try to stop at the top of P4, the bulge will leave you too far from the wall to reach the anchors. \n\n\nAim for Red Shirt (head up the climbers trail, walk along the cliff to the right/east for ~200 m to the deepest part of the bowl) finding the red shirt on the ground and 2 large trees, one of which has fallen. Continue another ~20 m to the right on level-ish ground to a ~4 foot tall detached flake.

Expect difficulties in the 5.11 range and occasonal 10 ft runouts in the 5.10 range.

Anchors at the top of  P1, 2, 3, 4 have cord and a quick link to rap on, P5 has cord only, P6 has a runner and locker that should be traded out for cord, P7 bolts only (would be hard to pull your rope off of this station), P6, sling around a single bolt with a biner. \n\n\nLocate the route about 600 ft right of where the trail meets the cliff and perhaps 100 ft left of Red Shirt's corner. We found it easiest to locate Red shirt's dual tree start and go left from there. A distinctive black bulge 45 meters up above a stem corner makes for a good landmark. Expect 45 min to 2 hours on approach. Good trail.\nSingle rack 0.3 to 3, optional 4 and nuts. 6 quickdraws and several alpine draws.

Ignore the 3rd bolt out right and instead continue up and left with very minimal pro (apparently on the FA they more or less did this pitch without any pro at all down low). When in doubt continue up and left. One final bolt before a somewhat difficult step up gets you to the anchor. \n\nPitch 4 (5.10b, 35m) - Clip a fixed wire in a shallow crack directly above the belay (also a nice confirmation you are still on route at this point) and fire through some committing stem moves with a bolt above for pro. Continue up and left to a ledgey section below a obvious left facing corner crack. Climb the crack for a meter or two before moving right and making a flat traverse for about 15 or so meters passing bolts from other routes along the way. The anchor isn't visible along the traverse so just trust that you are in the right place and you should see it a couple meters after an old piton.\n\nPitch 5 (5.9, 35m) - Move up and right from the belay to a bolt, followed by a second bolt further up and right. A few thin slab moves gets you into a series of blocks and cracks as you trend up and right. Pass a two bolt belay and continue on another couple meters to a 3 bolt belay.\n\nPitch 6 (5.10a, 30m) - Move out right along easy slab to under the obvious corner crack system. Move into the steep crack and fire through the first overhang with some easy but physical moves to get under a second, bigger, overhang with a good rest in-between thankfully. Surmount the second overhang (physical crux of the route in my opinion) and then clip a bolt on the ledge above before making a weird downclimb out left and past another bolt to a small ledge with a bolt, a piton, and an aluminum bolt for the belay.\n\nPitch 7 (5.8, 20m) - Step left from the belay around an easy but exposed traverse and then continue up the groove to a bolted belay on a ledge, or just go over the ridge an belay off a tree on the other side of the mountain.\n\nWalk off the hikers/scramble trail to descend. \n\n\nStandard trad rack.

Genereux ground-up solo bolted the first 4 pitches, before finishing the last 2 on rappel. With the exception of P4, the bolting style feels very sporty and safe. Genereux has kindly placed bolts close to each belay stance to prevent factor 2 falls. The rock is generally compact - lots of techy face and open book stemming, with an absolutely phenomenal hand traverse and mini-boulder on P5.\n\nAll belays are modern Fixe rap rings. The route can easily be rappelled with a 70 m rope. A 60 m way work as well, but you may have to knot block to rap P4. Double ropes let you rap the cliff in 3, ~60 m rappels (rap stations at P6, P4 and P2 are all plumb). \n\nGrades are as Genereux has them-\n\nP1: 5.11a, 30 m (QDs, optional 0.5/0.75 camalot); Climb the detached flake at the bottom to gain your first bolt (2-3 m), then head straight up a left facing corner/groove/pseudo stem-box. Some elegance, some awkwardness, and deteriorating rock quality near the top of the pitch. Belay station is on your right.\n\nP2: 5.9, 25 m (QDs); step left and up from the belay to find your first bolt on the right hand face. Leave the corner to stay on the right hand wall and climb the pinnacle to the top. Spot your belay at the top of the next pinnacle and follow the bolt line up. Some loose rock, this is very clearly an approach pitch.\n\nP3: 5.11b, 25 m (QDs); Maybe I missed something, but this felt absolutely nails for the Genereux grade. Clip the bolt to the right of the belay stance and complete a 5.11 sequence on thin holds past 3 bolts before heading slightly right to a left facing corner (follow the modern Fixe bolts, do not be distracted by the far away bolt up and left). Generally follow the shallow corner through easy terrain to a rest stance before a bulge. Traverse left on thin holds (5.11) under the bulge and gain another rest stance, reaching up and right to clip a bolt. The corner becomes shallower here and is capped a couple meters above your head by a tiny roof. The next bolt is up and around the corner, but well below the roof. Cross the corner (crux) and head up through easy terrain to belay on a ledge (do not traverse right to the other belay stances).\n\nP4: 5.10c, PG13, 32 m (QDs); Follow the bolt line on the grey slab to your left. Head up the slab to a sloping ledge, before heading up spacious bolts through a number of somewhat tenuous, less than vertical sequences at the grade. The rock is incredibly sharp on this pitch- lots of spikey slopers and the occasional razor blade crimp. As you near the top, the rock becomes steeper, trend slightly right over the bulge. There's an optional old pin a couple meters left of the belay that can be used for bonus protection on the easy rightward traverse. PG13 for the couple of places on this pitch that a fall may be slightly bigger than ideal onto low angle terrain. \n\nP5: 5.12a, 30 m (QDs); The money pitch! This pitch is so good you'll forget about whatever awkwardness or loose rock you've gone through to get here. Carefully head up and left from the belay stance through easy, loose, stepped terrain. Pull thin moves to gain easier terrain into a groove slightly to your right. Follow the bolt line, staying on the right bolt line aiming for the left facing corner that arches left over the yellow wall. Climb up the right side of the yellow wall to a good hand rail, and reach out left to clip your bolt. Traverse left across an incredibly fluid, absolutely slamming hand traverse making a couple of hard moves (do not clip any of the bolts on the left bolt line, none are shared). Pull an exciting, exposed mini boulder, up/right to surmount the bulge formed by the arching left corner. Clip one last bolt for your follower, and then traverse hard left to the belay. \n\nP6: 5.11a, 20 m (QDs); Left bolt line, slab/face to an overhang (slightly harder, maybe 5.11b). Right bolt line, slab/face to thin face. Right bolt line is the original finish and brings you to a more comfortable belay stance nearly plumb with the anchors at the top of P4. \n\n\n\nFrom the climbers trail, head right (east) following the cliff band for ~300 m. Follow this to Red Shirt corner- the deepest, most sheltered part of the bowl behind 2 large tree's, one of which has fallen, and a red shirt. This is the first bolt line right of the red shirt (~5 m).\n\n14 QDs, optional 0.5/0.75 Camalot for P1.

Continue up to a belay on RS (fixed pins) then traverse left about 3M to another fixed anchor and belay.  The section that's shared w/ RS has two or three viable lines w/in the grade so it's possible to climb through even if people are doing this pitch of Red Shirt.) \n This pitch sounds scarier than it is. \n  \n P4: 5.10 35M.  Up a crack with good pro past a thin hands crux to a fixed anchor. \n  \n P5: 5.10+ R 35M.  A memorable pitch. Up a corner with one or two tricky moves and good pro until you reach a much remarked upon handrail which traverses straight right across the face.  There are four or five bolts on the traverse the last of which is higher than the rest and is the only one which is easy to see from the start of the pitch; it's easy to climb past the traverse but here are a couple of hints to find the start: 1. It's about 10M above the belay 2. there is a sucker bolt above and to the left of the corner about 5M above the traverse -- if you can see this bolt, you've gone too high. \n Once you've found the start of the traverse, rail right, easy but exciting as there is no pro for at least 4M from the corner.  There is a good placement before the first bolt; I put a nut here but a cam would have been better as the nut popped before the second got to it, exposing him to an unnecessarily unprotected traverse.  (Note: the guidebook mentions that some people do the traverse with their feet on the rail; if you use this approach, give the pitch an X as it clipping the bolts would be almost impossible.)  Continue right on the traverse until you reach a point where there is a bolt to your right and one above you; both options work, but going up seemed more obvious to me though I thought getting to the next bolt was the crux and slightly exciting at that.  Once you clip the upper bolt, contend w/ the technical crux of the pitch, moving right horizontally past the bolt onto a decent ledge.  From here the anchors are 10M above and 3M right with no hope of pro; fortunately the climbing isn't too hard (~5.9) with the hardest moves being at the start.  Once you leave the corner, the rock is exceptionally prickly; finger pain may heighten your emotions as you run it out to the anchor. \n  \n P6 10- 30M.  From the anchor go up and right to a bolt, then up and left to another, a little spicey in its own right.

Its limited technical difficulties &amp; less-than-vertical rock will help acquaint the novice to the cliff, but the loose rock and traversing might leave some grumbling. This, pioneered by Greenwood, Kahl and Lofthouse in 1962, was one of the earliest routes to go to the top. Also, this route is a bit infamous for the disproportionate number of injuries and fatality(ies). A full description may be found in the excellent, \"Yamnusk Rock\" climbing guide by Andy Generaux. Since the publication of the latest guide book retrofitting efforts have changed the layout of the fixed hardware on the route - see marked up topo photo. \n\nP1. Follow a small corner, traverse L to a broken pillar. Ascend the pillar. Go past a ledge to the base of a chimney and belay. The rock seemed a bit slick. ~40m. 5.7.\n\nP2. Go up the chimney passing 3 bolts, and step left onto blocky terrain at the top of the rock rib. Look to the right for a fixed belay (2 bolts) on a nice ledge. It feels a bit slick in the chimney. ~30m. 5.8.\n\nP3. Head up and left generally staying in the big corner. Near the top the corner pinches into a chimney feature, where you can stand no-hands on a ledge at the bottom. You can gear belay in the chimney, or step left around the arete, and traverse to a fixed anchor (2 bolts with quick links, tied together with cord. If you went up the chimney and the crack above you looks harder than 5.7, look down and to your left) above a small pedestal. 5.7, ~35m. Note, a redirect for your follower is considerate here - a small piece (0.2-0.5) and a sling helps. \n\nP4. This is an interesting pitch. Lead slightly down &amp; left (~7 m) to a belay with 2 bolts on a small ledge. This pitch may excite your second. Lowering out seems like a much easier and safer option for the second. \n\nP5. Step down and left off the belay to reach a weakness, and then climb up to a bolt (alpine draw). Climb hard left past 2 more bolts (alpine draws, skip the pin, the 3rd bolt will come into view in one more move), before stepping down and making a move up onto a ledge/ramp. Continue along the ledge to a left facing corner with a pair of pins at the base, scramble up the corner to a comfortable ledge with a 2-bolt belay. Put a bit of gear in to protect your follower. 5.7, ~25 m. \n\nP6. Go left and up an obvious chimney to a crack to a good ledge with a big block on it. The Genereux book has a belay here (in the corner behind the block), looks like it would be gear. 5.6, ~30 m\n\nP7. This is a really fun pitch. Climb the left wall up past some pins, and then scramble up the corner on your right. As the rock transitions to yellow and gets steeper, step right, around the right edge of  low angle dihedral/corner that you have been cruising, to gain a right facing corner. Look up and left for a pin. Continue up to clear the steeper terrain; as you come up onto a pseudo-ledge, look ~10m up and right for a pair of bolts. This is your 2-bolt belay, shared with \"Dreambed\" at the top of a pillar. A redirect with a finger sized cam (0.4) is available before you traverse over. 5.6, ~45 m\n\nP8. Traverse right, past two pitons to the base of a shattered pillar (ignore the bolt above, it is for the last pitch of the climb Dreambed'). Make an airy move around this pillar, climb up and right on loose blocky rocks until it is easier to continue straight up, past a fixed piton and eventually up a shallow groove/corner to the top. Find a comfortable place to belay (no fixed anchor, hand crack, tree, bodyweight). 5.6, ~25 m.\n\nDescent: Walk off around the back side of the cliff. It's probably best to not leave anything at the base of the climb, so that you don't have to go back up to the base of the cliff.\n\n\nThis is a bit of a challenge to describe for me.  Take the climber's trail up the steep scree up to the base of the cliff.  Consider wearing a helmet before you get to the cliff.  Go right along the cliff base for approximately 600.  The trail goes down a bit.  Continue east.  Look for 2 big trees.  The start is behind these trees.\nA rack of wires, a set of cams to #4 Friend will work.  Long slings are helpful.

I would call this fully sport with some slightly run out scramble sections. Sometimes it's nice having some gear in case you get off-line, but hopefully this description prevents that! All belays are bolted with rap rings with the exception of the top. I would not rap the route, but with double ropes you would be okay to make it to the ground with how many anchors can be found on the bolted lines to the right.

Gain the roof crack (under-cling style...sport climb) and traverse a meter to your right to clip an awkwardly placed first bolt (they probably hung from a cam in the roof to drill it in). A short, tenuous layback sequence gets you to a no-hands rest before the line starts traversing right again (extend your first bolt). Follow the bolts rightward on super jugs before it veers up (extend the last bolt on the traverse) through another corner (still on super-jugs) to a belay just to the right of the bolt line which continues straight up for the next pitch. The bolts are very tightly spaced on this pitch. Belay is semi-hanging on a good foot rail. \n\nP3: 5.10b, 35 m: Step left from the belay and follow the bolt line up the vertical wall for two bolts. Pull onto lower angle territory and trend left for your third bolt. Above you and maybe slightly to your right there is an obvious corner, do not take this corner, you will have a bad time it is a choss stack and your protection runs out very quickly. Instead, at the 3rd bolt, step to your left to stay in the good quality gray, stippled rock and look for more bolts. Genereux suggests gear, I can't comment beyond if you stay on the proper line the rock looks good and there are bolts. Comfortable belay at the ledge, overall 5 or 6 m left of the P2 anchors. \n\nP4: 5.10a, 25 m: Leave the belay to the right on the giant block that looks like it's going to rip off. Pass the marginal rock band and enjoy super buckets through vertical terrain for a few bolts. Follow the bolt line to the right, consider extending, skipping or back cleaning every second bolt on the traverse if you link this with the next pitch. Put a normal length draw on the anchor to keep your rope out from behind the flake.\n\nP5: 5.9, 20 m: Step down from the belay and traverse right to the pinnacle feature. There's a crack for pro (a 2?) if you want (don't clip the pin down low, rope drag will be horrendous), but it's 5.6 hero climbing to the first bolt. This one might be over graded, but there's a nice little sequence by the second bolt that is very well protected before you return to hero-bucket traversing to the right. There is a 6-7 m run out after the last bolt, you could maybe put in a marginal cam (.75?), trust the giant feet and generally good hands, it's maybe 5.4. Stop at the first anchors you see, semi-hanging belay.\n\nP6: 5.11b, 20 m: Exit the belay stance to the right, looking for the chalky hold on the headwall. Clip a bolt to your left from this first hold (reachy). Pull onto the yellow headwall and traverse hard left following the very tightly spaced bolts. This is a 4-star pitch, super exposed, super fun movement! This pitch seems excessively bolted, but you sort of have to do this when you're bolting on rap for a pitch that traverses so hard. Makes it easier to get back onto the wall if you or your follower fall! The most comfortable of the semi-hanging belays. \n\nP7: 5.12a/b, 25 m: Exit the belay to the left aiming for the corner. A tricky sequence in the first corner gets you to bolt 3, continue slightly left here and pull over the lip into another, more V-shaped corner (bolt 4 is hidden, but it's where you want it!). Move quickly, the pump builds as you mash yourself into a tight box on poor holds. The crux comes as you exit this corner to the right, pulling over a final lip back into the grey rock. No stopper moves, but quite sustained and cryptic. Someone has ticked holds that I am not sure how you could possibly use... You can link this and the next pitch fairly easily. \n\nP8: 5.11a, 20 m: Head up and right from the belay passing a couple of bolts on your way to a roof. There is a slab-ish crux as your cut left under the roof. Continue up and left on to super sharp grey rock. There's maybe one more move up by the last bolt on the vertical wall. Super jugs to the top, mind the bits of shale! You can sit on a little grassy patch just left of the final belay. If you link this and the last pitch, extend the draws on this pitch. \n\n\n\nFind the start of \"Red Shirt\" which has the tattered remains of a red shirt at its base (a left trending crack/ramp in the deepest part of the bowl). Walk down/climbers left for a 5 or 6 meters to the first, obvious corner (look for bolts). \n\n8 short and 4 extendable draws, perhaps a very light rack (cams .3 to 2). If you link pitches, bring maybe 10 short draws and 6 or 7 extendable draws."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"3Z5bP0gdXTW+WkBij5wYmw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"64134508f0cf0083295d8839","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:34:16.816Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,3a1a6f6f-d454-572b-a83c-d7ca7caa45ad,dd9e5b3f-481d-5d35-be5a-40628f9c189b","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Yamnuska","The Bowl and Red Shirt"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.12a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]},"bbox":[-115.11921643039805,51.12335033981814,-115.11778356960193,51.12424966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"3Z5bP0gdXTW+WkBij5wYmw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.11921643039805,51.12335033981814],[-115.11778356960193,51.12335033981814],[-115.11778356960193,51.12424966018187],[-115.11921643039805,51.12424966018187],[-115.11921643039805,51.12335033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Another area that has a good mix of climbing styles.
