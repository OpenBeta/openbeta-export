This climb is predominantly sport – i.e. almost all bolts, but has a very traditional flavour. Bolted ground up. All rap stations are modern Fixe rap rings except for the top station, and the route can be rappelled fairly easily. Grades as per Genereux, cam sizes are BD-\n\nP1: 5.9 pg13, 35 m: Scramble up to a high first bolt over a bit of questionable rock. Head straight up, place a 0.1 cam, then follow the path of least resistance up the bolt line. A high, tenuous no hands rest lets you get in a small nut- extend this and head left for a ledge and left facing, left leaning corner. Head up the corner/left edge of the ramp clipping two bolts. Look up and right for your last bolt before traversing a couple of meters to the right to the belay stance. The last bolt is for your follower. Extend each draw from the nut up. Have your belayer stand climbers right of the pitch, you may send down some loose rock.\n\nP2: 5.10c, 30 m: Look up and right from the belay to locate your first bolt/the left facing corner, this is where you’re headed. Traverse hard right and place a 0.1 cam overhead in the thin seam. Navigate the questionable rock band to pull up into the dihedral and clip your first bolt. A couple of tricky dihedral moves protected by the bolt get you high enough to traverse into the crack/corner. Place a cam (0.5/0.75) and then smash your way up on big holds through easier terrain. Top out on a pillar and work your way up over easy ground to a budge. Clip overhead (extend) and pull an easy compression sequence to juggy terrain and a belay ledge.\n\nP3: 5.8 pg13, 30 m: Smash off the belay ledge on big holds past a couple of bolts. As the angle eases off you will be greeted with healthy run outs. Generally trend up/left on the slab, trusting that the bolts were placed on lead and make sense for drilling stances. As the rock steepens and becomes more featured, break left for the right facing corner/seam. This takes a 0.1/small nut, extend these pieces. One more bolt and then an easy but heady slab run out to the belay ledge.\n\nP4: 5.10d R, 45 m: Suicide Wall has a band of VERY questionable rock. You have just arrived at this band. Andy has done extremely well to find bolt placements, but nonetheless, there is one very committing, legitimately scary move. Traverse left on low angle terrain to clip the first bolt. Continue left/up along the path of least resistance, clipping/extending the second bolt. Head up/right, continuing your scramble on dreadful rock to gain the third bolt where the climbing finally starts. Clip overhead and then pull up into the corner. Once in the corner, you can comfortably stem and place a 0.2 cam. Now the scary part, pull up out of the corner and step left. The move isn’t hard, but the rock is really, really bad, and a fall would likely have you land on the low angle slab below. Anyway, don’t fall, step left, and clip a bolt. The rest of the pitch is stellar – head up the right facing corner clipping bolts along the way. Extend your draws as the bolt line goes out onto the rounded arête. Traverse left under the roof at the top of the arête on big incut holds (airy!) and then back right, following the bolt line. Pull a final bulge onto slab. At your last bolt, follow the path of least resistance which involves a slight traverse left to a crack/chimney feature. Run it out to the belay ledge (easy terrain but falling is not an option here).\n\nP5: 5.11b R, 40 m: From the belay, head straight up on easy terrain along a right facing corner. There is no gear for probably 7-8 m. Climb carefully, but stay relaxed, it’s like 5.5. Place a 0.2 in the first seam you get to, breathe a sigh of relief and continue up the corner as it narrows and becomes more secure. There are a couple of nut placements (offsets work well) in finger pods as you work your way up. The corner is capped by a roof (0.5 cam just under the roof, extend), pull around the arête to the left and then follow the bolt line to the semi-hanging belay. Holds are difficult to see, and surprisingly small. Lots of 5.10 sections, lots of rests. The line traverses right and then back left up higher. Stellar rock after the first bolt!\n\nP6: 5.10c, 50 m: Head up and right from the belay on mega sharp rock over the bulge. Pass 2 bolts to gain a ledge with a fixed pin. Head straight up the face, gunning for the bolts, with a brief deviation to the right. Then aim for the crack/seam and eventually corner.\n\nP7: 5.10b, 50 m: Cruise the right leaning corner (mostly gear). Pull out over broken rock to land yourself at the left end of a ledge. Look right for the belay rings.\n\nP8: 5.10c, 35m: Leave the belay ledge heading right for the Balrog corner. Climb the pillar until you can break left to the seam and aim for the bolt. Bucket slam until you reach lower angle terrain and widely spaced bolts on mega sharp rock. Take the corner/weakness to the top- bolt hangers (no rings) on the left to belay from as you top out.\n\nDescent: Walk off, or rap. Double ropes are required for rapping. It is somewhat difficult to reverse pitch 3, but you can rap from the top of pitch 3 to the top of pitch 1. The plumb line lands you several meters left of the ring bolts but it's easy enough to traverse/swing over to the stance. \n\n\n\nTake the climbers trail to the junction at the base of the cliff. Head left for perhaps 250 m. Lord of the Rings starts from the top of the highest scree cone - as you're walking on the base trail you stay mostly right next to the base of the cliff. The trail cuts below this scree cone; walk almost all the way past the scree cone and look for a faint trail that hugs the cliff going back up and right. \n\nTwo features to look for: Balrog corner. The giant corner system/slash that marks the end of Suicide Wall. Yamabushi roofs - perhaps the most imposing roof system on Yamnuska; Lord of the Rings starts just left of the Yamabushi bolt line, and just right of the low angle left leaning Balrog ramp (when you're looking at the cliff from a distance, the Balrog corner system is just right of Lord of the Rings, the climbs cross low down). \n\n15 draws (at least 8 should be extendable), cams from 0.1-1 (optional to #3), a set of nuts, helmets. 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5/0.75 or equivalents should be considered essential for this route. Double 60m+ ropes to rappel."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"H3XxzWzTVFqS3MSN3b6DTg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"641344f4f0cf0083295d876f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:33:56.680Z"},{"_id":"ZHqHU1GmS8aeELd/fpDQog==","name":"People of The Sun","grades":{"yds":"5.12c"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Cory Rogans & Rory O’Donnell,  September 2022","length":225,"content":{"description":"\nBetween the weekends of August 20th and September 18th, Cory Rogans and Myself put a new route up on the Suicide wall of Mt. Yamnuska. All pitches were put up on lead with a power drill. The climbing is hard and engaging from start to finish, but very worthwhile with mostly excellent rock the whole way. It weaves its way up in between Astroyam and Quantum Leap. We are extremely proud of our effort on the wall and hope others will enjoy it as much as we have. It took a lot of time and hard work to establish, but we feel it is an elegant addition and maintains the boldness of the existing routes on the wall. Special thanks to Jon Walsh for accompanying us on the final first ascent push and to Katie Reeder for the excellent company and moral support while establishing the last few pitches of the route.\n\nPitch 1 - 5.11b 40m (5 bolts + gear). From the belay climb up the prickled face rock and clip 2 bolts. At the 2nd bolt climb a chossy yellow crack and continue up past an old piton and eventually another bolt, ultimately making your way towards the obvious corner. Continue up the left arching corner making a few gear placements and eventually another bolt (crux). Pull the hard lay backing moves and pull into a prickled scoop. Place some more gear and then continue on a diagonally trending traverse out left to reach a bolted anchor. \n\nPitch 2 - 5.11b 40m (7 bolts + gear). From the belay, climb up and clip a high bolt out right. Downclimb and traverse right across a series of ledges. Continue up the steep corner (hard to get into) making a few thin gear placements eventually arriving at another bolt. Climb up on good holds and clip another bolt trending rightwards. Eventually you will arrive where you can place some gear at the base of the corner. (Extending majority of the pieces on the lower half of the climb is crucial to reduce rope drag on the upper corner). Climb up the corner past 3 bolts, eventually making one last hard sequence at the top of the corner where you can clip 1 last bolt and then traverse the big ledge rightwards to arrive at a bolted anchor.\n\nPitch 3 - 10c/R 20m (3 bolts). Climb above the belay on good holds and clip a bolt. Continue to traverse up and slightly left on good edges. You will eventually link into the rightwards trending traverse of astroyam. Clip 2 more bolts making a right trending diagonal traverse to a bolted belay. (This belay shares the same belay as astroyam) \n\nPitch 4 - 5.12c 40m (9 bolts) Make hard moves right above the belay, and follow the line of bolts through the intimidating looking roofs making multiple crux sequences with just enough holds to keep you going. After the crux climbing continue up towards the anchor, trending right first and then diagonally left. There is a bolted belay. The last part of the pitch is quite runout but climbs on excellent rock. \n\nPitch 5 - 5.11 45m (9 bolts + gear). Climb directly above the belay for about 15 feet and clip the first bolt. Continue straight up the corner clipping 2 more bolts until at the 3rd bolt you can traverse slightly out right and onto easier ground. Climb the easier ground until you can clip another bolt and then begin a rightwards trending traverse past one more bolt into a corner. Climb up the corner (placing a 0.75 in a crack) until you reach the top of the corner. Clip a bolt and traverse left onto easier ground. Continue straight up clipping 2 more bolts until you arrive at the base of a steep bulge. Pull the bulge, climbing a shallow corner and trending left, and you will end up on a big ledge where you can clip the last bolt, then make a leftwards trending traverse to a bolted anchor. \n\nPitch 6 - 5.11c/R 45m (5 bolts + micro gear). From the belay follow a rightwards trending traverse across some choss until you can clip a high first bolt. Continue straight up clipping 2 more bolts until you are right beside a massive roof. Reach around to the right and clip a bolt above the edge of the roof. Stay low (don’t climb high into the top of the corner and then traverse) and make a rightwards traverse directly across the lip of the roof using a crucial side pull/undercling crack and eventually go slightly up and clip another bolt. From here, continue up the obvious seam/corner making a small gear nest in a horizontal seam and then launch yourself the rest of the way to a bolted anchor. The upper half of this pitch is very runout and the resulting fall would be very big.\n\n\n\nApproach: Hike up to the base of Yamnuska, scrambling up the Direttissima cone until you are at the base of the wall. A little ways to the right of Direttissima there is a huge pillar that leads you to the base of the suicide wall. Climb this to it’s top (5.6). This is the same start for Astroyam and Quantum leap. You will arrive on the top of a giant pedestal with a bolted belay. \n\nGear: Bring a single rack from BD 0-3, single set of nuts, and 16 draws with a good selection of alpine draws."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"H3XxzWzTVFqS3MSN3b6DTg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"yEirnp8LVdeTMoYyIb6bJg==","_change":{"user":"yEirnp8LVdeTMoYyIb6bJg==","historyId":"641344f5f0cf0083295d8779","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:33:57.321Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,3a1a6f6f-d454-572b-a83c-d7ca7caa45ad,1f75f1cd-6cd3-545a-92dc-c48dddbe834e","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Yamnuska","Suicide Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"H3XxzWzTVFqS3MSN3b6DTg=="},"content":{"description":"I'm pretty sure the name says it all.
