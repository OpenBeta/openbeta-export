Start atop the large scree cone that requires scrambling up.  The line starts just left of a line of bolts and follows a crack for most of the first pitch. from there, head up the path of least resistance following the old pins. Numerous variations are available.\ndouble cams to #2 BD and a single #3, nuts, lots of slings (i.e. usual Yam rack)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"kVlGWqFdUIK3Cj9IYZ0bAA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]}},"createdBy":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","_change":{"user":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","historyId":"641344f1f0cf0083295d8754","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:33:53.515Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,3a1a6f6f-d454-572b-a83c-d7ca7caa45ad,9159465a-a15d-5082-b70a-3f48619d1b00","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Yamnuska","CMC Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1185,51.1238]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"kVlGWqFdUIK3Cj9IYZ0bAA=="},"content":{"description":"CMC Wall Area has some of the hardest climbs on the cliff.
