Dead vertical, incredibly compact limestone. The original line here was \"Sphinx\", which is one of the easier lines on the wall at 5.13a-5.13d (depending on who you ask).  \n  \n The wall gets a brief sun in the late afternoon/early evening (mostly West facing in a narrow canyon)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"64134405f0cf0083295d7fac","prevHistoryId":"64134404f0cf0083295d7fa1","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:29:56.472Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:38.579Z","updatedBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg=="}
