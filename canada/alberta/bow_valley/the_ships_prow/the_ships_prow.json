In the first edition of the Underground Guide to Kananaskis 2004, there is The Shining Path on the Mt.Indefitigable slab, coincidentally also well over 500m. So, here is another one – the Bow Valley’s! The Shining Path was a Peruvian terrorist group responsible for 20,000 deaths! This route was attempted years ago and left as a project. Still unclaimed, a different party gunned up to the base and had a go at this very obvious right-facing corner that seems to be perpetually running with water. Well, they succeeded; possibly the combined strengths of an alpinist and a sport climber. It did take them a long time however as they finished the last section in the dark with no torches. \n  \n The rock is said to be typical surrounding rock: good/bad/great/poor. The rack too is typical: many pins, no bolts, standard rack.There are a few different approaches, but the first ascentionists believe the el directo version up the drainage to be the best. It is a bit of a bushwack at first but opens higher up.To descend, take the easy scree slopes on the east side of the peak. \n  \n Climb up the main corner system passing the odd piece of fixed gear. More than half way up, the rock steepens and bad rock is had. Aid through this for a number of body lengths on dicey gear. Continue free climbing up until another short stretch of steep aid. Here, a huge rock finger protrudes out and back against the rock wall. Pass it, and move right then back into the corner. Continue up an out right until obvious steep, horrible rock is come upon. Go back left on slabs and multiple indistinct corners to the top. The last distance could be completed a number of ways. \n  \n In the posted photo, ‘A’ is the trad route Broadside, ‘B’ is The Shining Path, and ‘C’ is the ice route Little Bobby Onsight.\n\nSee photo\nPins, rockies rack, alpine stuff, make sure you have everything you need and don't leave anything at the base.

Move up to a fixed piton in a horizontal crack (old tension traverse). The piton may also be reached by following a thin crack to the left of the belay and using a few points of aid (original line).
