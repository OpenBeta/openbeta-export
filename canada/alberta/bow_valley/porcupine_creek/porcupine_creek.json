Located in the Elbow Sheep WPP most of the cliffs face south and get plenty of sun. Porcupine Creek runs thru and directly beside some of the climbing areas. Random camping is governed by the rules of the Elbow-Sheep WPP. This area is seeing much higher trail traffic due to Covid 19, even throughout the winter the trail along the creek and past the climbing areas has been very busy. There is no restriction on camping in place currently meaning this is a great spot to get some freedom camping in along with climbing right next to your tent."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134459f0cf0083295d8327","prevHistoryId":"64134452f0cf0083295d82e4","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:30:50.371Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:30:52.497Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
