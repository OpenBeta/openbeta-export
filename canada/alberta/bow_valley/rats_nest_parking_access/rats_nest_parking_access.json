Thanks Greg! \n  \n Gear: The total draws needed for the climb is 13 plus anchor kits. Most stations have two off-set rap rings with an extra bolt to make room at the belay. \n  \n 1. 15 m, 5.10- (6 bolts). Climb up a seam to a ledge. \n  \n 2. 22 m, 5.12b (8 bolts). Move up the face past a crux to a small stance. \n  \n 3. 22 m, 5.11b (8 bolts). Climb up and through a small roof and fun climbing above to a ledge \n  \n 4. 22 m, 5.12a (10 bolts). Follow bolts through a roof to a belay on top of the slab. \n  \n 5. 25 m, 5.11a (8 bolts). Move up a vertical wall past a rap station onto a large (lunch) ledge to a belay.  \n  \n 6. 30 m, 5.12a (13 bolts). Face climbing up to the bottom of an arÃªte, follow it until easier ground forces you left, then climb straight up to a station in an alcove. \n  \n 7. 22 m, 5.12a (8 bolts). Move right and up to a crux below some nice features which will bring you to a hanging belay at a jug. \n  \n 8. 20 m, 5.11d (6 bolts). Climb through easy roofs to a crux in an open book corner that is below some more easy steep climbing to a ledge and a belay station. \n  \n 9. 20 m, 5.12a (6 bolts). Steep and powerful climbing right off the ledge leads to some easy ground and a belay. \n  \n Descent: \n To walk off: Climb to the right past a bolt to a ledge with a two-bolt station. Once on the ledge, walk east for about one km following a rough trail below a wall to a trail heading down to the parking lot. \n  \n To rappel: You will need a 70 m rope or two ropes. You may need to back clip some of the bolts to reach the stations. Greg recommends climbing on a 60 m rope with a tug line to haul the backpack.\n\nPark at the Ratsnest Cave parking lot. Follow the trail for Ratsnest Cave for approximately 5 minutes to a fork on the left bank of the creek, take the left turn which leads to a cutline. If you missed the fork you will get to the same cutline. Follow a trail west down the cutline for about 200 m to where the approach trail turns right up into the forest. After 20 minutes the trail leaves the forest and follows a road almost all the way to the drainage from Middle Grotto (aka The Scantuary). Once in the drainage follow it past the dry-tooling area called The Playground until inside the grotto. Keep an eye on the right for a trail cut into the scree below a tree triangle below the orange wall. This trail will lead you to the base of the route. Approach time is approx. 1 hour.\nBolts, Draws (13)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"SE0WX3obUzyrjEnfvA2UgQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.24446,51.05151]}},"createdBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","_change":{"user":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","historyId":"641344aaf0cf0083295d8516","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:32:42.964Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,c14bc2e9-d3a8-5cdf-9e8e-802b012aaec4,484d165f-7a1b-533c-ab8c-49dfbc0d9481","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Bow Valley","Rat's Nest Parking Access"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.24446,51.05151]},"bbox":[-115.24517531152675,51.05106033981814,-115.24374468847327,51.05195966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"SE0WX3obUzyrjEnfvA2UgQ=="},"content":{"description":"A few routes off grotto mountain that use the infamous rat's nest parking lot."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641344aaf0cf0083295d8516","prevHistoryId":"641344a9f0cf0083295d8510","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:32:40.467Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:46.200Z","updatedBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw=="}
