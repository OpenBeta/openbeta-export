Has a bit of everything and is really good and varied. It was established in excellent style of bolting on lead and it's ease of access and amount of traffic have really cleaned it up (almost no loose rock on this climb, which is something to be said about the chossies).  \n  \n It is the third route in and is approached via the Nanny Goat Approach. Look for a 3rd class ramp that goes into a right facing corner. Those are the two fist pitches that are linked and listed as pitch 1 in the description.  \n  \n We followed a party in August 2015 and had no trouble at stations sharing the smaller one. They decided to rap but our gut told us that the decent would be faster. It was, and it was our first time on the route and we were unsure where to go exactly.  \n  \n The climb \n  \n 1. 55m, 5.8 (11 bolts). Climb the slab to the corner (rappel anchor). At the top of the corner climb up and left to belay on the higher of two ledges. \n  \n 2. 40m, 5.10a (9 bolts, 1 fixed piton). Climb up and right to a difficult mantle at the second bolt. Continue up then traverse left along a seam to a break. Climb easily up and right to a short left facing corner and a bolted and chained belay below a small roof. \n  \n 3. 30m, 5.7 (6 bolts). Pass a small roof on the right then angle right to a head wall From the third \n bolt climb right then up and left to a bolt above a slab. Climb up slabs and headwalls beforestepping left to a chain belay below a treed ledge. \n  \n 4. 15m, 3rd class. Scramble up on slabs to a bolt belay at the left end of the large treed ledge. It is possible to follow the ledge right and drop into Coire Duhb and scramble down to the base. \n  \n 5. 40m, 5.9 (10 bolts). Climb up along bolts towards a small overhang traversing left under it, almost to the large right facing corner, then up to a bolt belay on a small ledge below an overhang. \n  \n 6. 25m, 5.8 (6 bolts). Pass the overhang on the right and weave up to a hanging belay. \n  \n 7. 25m, 5.9 (5 bolts, 1 fixed piton). Continue up to the top of the large right facing corner where the wall gets steep at a bolt. Step right and climb the undercut wall to a crack right of the second headwall bolt. Continue up slabs to a ledge then a layback feature to a fixed piton below a small roof. Pass the roof to a bolted belay on a small ledge. Either rappel from here or angle right 10m to scree and a tree belay. NOTE: there was a 2 bolt belay station at the top after the 10m of climbing that was needed. Linking this extra pitch with the 5.9 pitch add no drag or problems.   \n  \n The descent \n  \n Recommended: \n  \n Top out and do the Nanny Goat descent. From the top of the route, hike up a short distance (past two bolts which are good for bringing up the second as the trees are small) and walk down to the drainage between Nanny goat and Kid goat. There is a short rappel or class 3 down climb at the bottom. \n  \n Rappelling: \n  \n The route can be rappelled in 8 rappels on a single 60m rope. Knot the rope ends  especially for pitches 2 \n and 5.\n\n3 route to the left from the approach.\nBolts galore. If not linking pitches the FA recommends 8 quick draws, 4 long slings, 2 anchor slings. 60m rope. a 80m rope could be used to link larger sections as a 60m cannot link some smaller sections"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"nK8suKF/W3WE4MgydP2LzQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.13463,51.09308]}},"createdBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","_change":{"user":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","historyId":"64134414f0cf0083295d8021","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:30:12.624Z"},{"_id":"ze02MTy1QdSGyqEZzrqOvg==","name":"Dark Decade","grades":{"yds":"5.10d"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"May 2022","length":188,"content":{"description":"\nBolted fall 2021/ Spring 2022. Climbing is techy with often incut hidden holds, on high quality, sharp limestone, that offers lots of friction. Mostly bolted ground up on lead. Each station is bolted with rap anchors, but topo shows the ideal rap line. A 70m rope is required to rappel the route, however walking off is recommended on a well established trail. This trail does not return back to the base of the climb.\n\nP1 : 5.10b | 15m / 7 bolts\nStep off the ground just right of a right facing corner to find good holds on overlapping slab. Climb up right of a steep wall into a groove/ slot, and step right around a pinnacle to locate the belay.\n\nP2 : 5.10d | 25m / 11 bolts\nThis pitch is characterized mostly by a rising left traverses. Overcome a steep wall off the belay using side pulls to pull over a ledge onto good slab. Continuously move up and left until reaching a high bolt where the route jogs harder left. Step up, clipping this with an alpine draw, to stepping back down and then begin a rising leftward traverse with technical movement. End with a 'no hands' slab sequence to gain the belay.\n\nP3: 5.10c | 28m / 10 bolts\nStem and mantle out of a corner and over a small roof gaining easier terrain. Step onto a steep wall with a vertical finger crack to finish in a groove running upwards to a protected belay.\n\nP4: 5.7 | 25m or 35m / 5 bolts\nThe junk pitch of the route. Both in terms of rock quality and climbing. This short lived pitch clips a bolt left off the belay and heads upwards as difficulty quickly and continuously eases.\n\nEither use the optional belay bolts at the first station just below the vegetated tree island where communication will be easier. This is about 25m.\nOr, clip this first station and continue moving up into the forrest and find a bolted belay on the back wall. This will be faster and more straight forward but harder to communicate with your partner. 35m.\n\n*Move belay left though forest 30 m to continue climb.

As the rock deteriorates stay just right of the bolt line to find great but thin hidden crimp rails. Off the rails work towards an obvious roof using good incut side pulls to find a hidden jug overtop. Rock over the roof onto good slab and head upwards towards to belay in a small bay corner.\n\nP6: 5.10c | 30m / 11 bolts\nTwo close bolts protect an out-of-charecter boulder problem right off the belay. Clip a third bolt as the route reverts back to sharp and textured limestone. Enter a right facing vertical corner to climb into a ramp system and step out onto exposed slab.\n\nP7: 5.10b | 30m / 9 bolts\nLead off the belay to under a roof and circumnavigate rightward pulling up an overlap finding hidden holds with good feet onto immaculate slab as difficulty eases to the final belay on a comfortable ledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n60M to the right and slightly uphill of 'Beautiful Century'.\n\nBolted, with two ring bolt anchors at every station."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"nK8suKF/W3WE4MgydP2LzQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.13463,51.09308]}},"createdBy":"LU5kvY+uWMKxBeBjbxP8rg==","_change":{"user":"LU5kvY+uWMKxBeBjbxP8rg==","historyId":"64134415f0cf0083295d802b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:30:13.248Z"},{"_id":"Ykoopi/TQFuj6Se1PvmR4g==","name":"Deception","grades":{"yds":"5.7+"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"T.

Climb up the ramp about 10m to a 2 bolt belay below a big block.\n\nPitch-2: 25m, 5.6, 2 bolts and gear.  Climb around the big block on the left to the bottom of a shallow corner with intermittent cracks that trends slightly left.  Follow the corner to a bolt.  Move up a little then left to another bolt, then up and back right into the corner to reach a good ledge and 2 bolt anchor.\n\nPitch-3: 30m, 5.6, 7 bolts.  Follow the bolts up and right, then through a break in the rib on the left.  This pitch is steeper at the top but has great holds.  There is a 2 bolt station just after you move left through the break.\n\nPitches 4 and 5: 40m, 5.5-5.6, 2 bolts, belay station, 2 bolts.  It is recommend to climb pitches 4 and 5 as one pitch.  Follow the easy ramp on the left to a bolt where it steepens.  Continue up the ramp past another bolt to a 2 bolt belay.  Continue up the ramp past 2 more bolts to another 2 bolt station.  Once you reach the first steeper part of the ramp the climbing is very sustained.  Not recommended for beginners.\n\nPitches 6 and 7: 35m, 5.5-5.6, 2 bolts, belay station, 2 bolts.  It is recommended to climb pitches 6 and 7 as one pitch.  It is possible to place a small nut about 2m above the belay.  Continue up the ramp to a 2 bolt belay below a vertical wall.  Put a very long sling on one of the belay bolts, then climb down about 3m into the top of a gulley at the left end of the wall.  Step across the gulley and up a short step to a bolt.  It is easiest to move a little left to pass the bolt then trend back up and right and follow the ramp to a 2 bolt belay.\n\nPitch-8: 20m, 5.5, 2 bolts and 1 piton.  Climb easily straight up to a scree ramp trending up to the right, then belay at a 2 bolt anchor on the far side of the scree.\n\nPitch-9: 35m, 5.5, 2 bolts.  Walk up the scree ramp for about 20m then climb easy slabs up and right to a 2 bolt station.  From this station you can see a right facing corner with a crack up left (not the route) and a short left facing corner up right (Pitch-10).\n\nPitch-10: 30m, 5.8, 6 bolts.  Move up and right about 3m to a bolt.  Continue up and right into the right facing corner.  A tricky move gets you to the top of the corner.  Move up left into a groove then pass two more bolts to make a steep move on smaller holds (the crux).  Move up right to the final 2 bolt anchor.  An easy scramble straight up takes you to the descent trail in about 20m.\n\n\nLocated in a bay with many big dead trees.
