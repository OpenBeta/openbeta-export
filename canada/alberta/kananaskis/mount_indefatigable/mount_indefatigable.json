Indefatigable slab for nearly 2000 feet (600m)of climbing! The rock is generally very solid with excellent friction. The numerous small ledges do tend to accumulate rocks, so be wary, especially in early season. There are many very nice belays to choose from on almost every pitch. Some take a 70m rope to reach (or just a bit of simul on easy ground with a 60m). Basically, climb until you hit the end of the rope on every pitch then build a belay at the best spot. A topo is completely unnecessary for this climb, as it's impossible to get lost.\n\nThe route difficulty can vary widely from 5.4 to 5.8 depending on the line chosen. The rule of thumb is, if it's hard head horizontally from where you are. The new guidebook Canadian Rock: Select Climbs of the West calls the route 5.8. I'd say that's only true if you stay in the dihedral the entire time and purposefully avoid the slab.\n\nThe route is all gear anchors with VERY minimal fixed gear (3 pins seen in total pitches in summer 2022).\n\n\n\nFrom Calgary:\n\nTake Kananaskis Trail/AB-40 S for 50.0 km\n\nTurn right onto Smith Dorrien Trail/Hwy 742 for 2.2 km\n\nSlight left onto Kananaskis Lakes Trail for 7.6 km\n\nTurn right to stay on Kananaskis Lakes Trail for 3.6 km\n\nSlight left to stay on Kananaskis Lakes Trail\n\nPark at the Interlakes Parking Area\n\n<strong>or Google \"Kananaskis Interlakes Campground\" and it'll pull up right near the lake parking area. </strong>\n\n<strong>Approach</strong>\n\nHike across the dam and follow the main hikers trail that parallels the lake. Do not go up past the bear closure sign on the decommissioned summit trail. The approach trail is pretty flat all the way to the scree slope when the route becomes very apparent. Don't follow any smaller offshoot trails that head downhill to the lakeshore, just follow the signs with hiker symbols on them. It's pretty straightforward. 25 minutes to scree slope from car. Head up the scree to the base of the route.\n\nClimb the small right facing dihedral (note the <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/v/107188369\">beta photo</a>). If the rock is good, it's the right dihedral. First few hundred feet can be easily walked up / solo'd\n\n<strong>Descent</strong>\n\nFrom the topout of Joy, belay up your second, climb about 5 more meters up and drop over to the 4th class on the right side (east). Drop onto that faint trail and follow it up on the east side of the ridge. There is one last short section (a notch) of easy 4th class climbing that looks harder from far away, but is easy and can take a bit of gear if you like as it's above a BIG drop if you kludged it. Once on top of this notch, you're almost immediately on a lush alpine meadow ridge.\n\nOption 1 (BEST): Switchback down the hill and follow a trail that curves around the first gully. Follow the faint trails and count the gullies. You'll wander through some thick trees on a good trail to reach the 3rd gully, which is wide and all scree. Scree ski all the way back down to the main hikers trail. \n\nOption 2: Same as above, but go down the second gully. This involves occasional downclimbing, tons of loose and sharp rocks, and generally stinks compared to the easy 3rd gully. Try not to end up in this one, but at least it doesn't cliff out anywhere if you do by accident.\n\nDouble set of cams from tiny to #1 red camalot (2\"), single #2 yellow camalot (2.5\"), a couple nuts, and a couple extra finger sized cams are nice depending on comfort level (0.3-0.75 camalots being the most useful). Slings. <br />  <br /> Basically the route eats #0.3 - #0.75 cams and the rest is necessary here and there."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"KjAl8dP4XAOE3nvSKpw8CQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1681,50.6371]}},"createdBy":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","_change":{"user":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","historyId":"64134864f0cf0083295da874","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:48:36.648Z"},{"_id":"Eegd5CqoT2u3fH9/BCbXtA==","name":"Joyless","grades":{"yds":"5.8"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"A climber hoping to climb Joy","length":606,"content":{"description":"I made this page so you don’t climb this route. Please climb Joy, I hear it is a great time and you get the same amazing view. If you accidentally choose the wrong dihedral, this page is here to help you.  \n  \n Joyless is runout, dangerous, with poor protection and blocks the size of your head that can easy pull free from a cam or a foot. CLIMB Climb the first SUPER OBVIOUS dihedral up from the scree. This is the one that extends 200 ft up from the slab. Climb the first few hundred feet of 3rd and then rope up for 2-3 long pitches until to reach a bolt at a break in the dihedral. \n  \n Do not continue dihedral proper to the right. It is even more runout! Holds and pro disappear from the dihedral making it a pure slab climb. Unable to build an anchor I had to down climb 150 ft of slab going this way accidentally. Instead, go up the break and join another dihedral to the left. \n  \n Continuing up this next dihedral the climbing is pretty good 5.6 for a 100m. Then the dihedral curves into a ‘roof’. You must traverse under this roof on a dirty slab. Pro is sparse and poor as you go through this section and then up along the dihedral.  \n  \n Be very careful about what you touch with feet as you near the top of the dihedral where it meets the ridge. A lot of larger stuff is loose and I knocked down a hunk of rock the size of my head down on my belayer here. Another party also did so and injured the belayer badly enough that they had to bail from this point.  \n  \n The dihedral will now intersect with the ridge. Looking around the ridge you will see a steep gulley. You will likely want to set up belay somewhere here before continuing.  \n  \n Look around the corner of the ridge for a bolt and work an airy traverse above the steep gulley. There will be a piton a little afterwards until you traverse up and right into a scree / dirty alcove. From here choose a route up the steep, overhangy holds to regain the top of the ridge. I ended the climb with a left hand in the left crack to provide protection and some stability.  \n  \n After the steep wall you’ll can climb up easy stuff to the top of the ridge. Looking over can look over to see its a knife edge going up the ridge with one side being a wide slab. Instead, take the scree trail ‘climber’s right’ along the ridge. This section has high fall risk but can be easily simul-climbed or unroped. DESCENT Join the descent ridge and take the third gulley down. Its the right gulley when it looks dirtier than scree. Scree-ski down and reverse trail.\n\nHike across the dam and follow the main hikers trail that parallels he lake. Do not go up past the bear closure sign on the summit trail. The approach trail is pretty flat all the way to the scree slope when the route becomes very apparent. Don't follow any smaller offshoot trails that head downhill to the lakeshore, just follow the signs with hiker symbols on them. It's pretty straightforward. 25 minutes to scree slope from car. Head up the scree to the base of the route.\nMost of the pro you think you can place will pull when you check your gear. Its best to start looking to build an anchor within the last 10m of your rope as its extremely difficult to find three pieces of good gear for an anchor. Very few I built would I want to take a lead fall.  <br />  <br /> Due to the poor quality and quality of pro this climb will have regular 40 ft runouts.  I might have spent just as much looking / placing pro as climbing. <br />  <br /> Standard double rack with small nuts will provide you this flexibility."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"KjAl8dP4XAOE3nvSKpw8CQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1681,50.6371]}},"createdBy":"uJhr6vLiUQa3V/SKNIlwrA==","_change":{"user":"uJhr6vLiUQa3V/SKNIlwrA==","historyId":"64134865f0cf0083295da87e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:48:37.444Z"},{"_id":"Ucj1SV5cSz+GAlOPuDOHlg==","name":"The Shining Path","grades":{"yds":"5.7"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"G.Cornell and T.Devonshire, July 2002","length":606,"content":{"description":"From the folks at  rockiesobscure.com! \n  \n Joy’s new neighbor! The Shining Path is about 100m longer and takes the slim corner in the middle of the big slab. The route is slightly more runout especially on the crux and the rock is much looser than Joy, again, much looser in spots, however it has been repeated a number of times since showing up on the scene. Take gear to 2″, pins, Tri-Cams, medium nuts and mandatory 60m ropes minimum. This route is more about the expansive vista of slab and the corner your on than what is worth of the climbing, however the 3 or 4 steep pitches after the 5.3 ramble is an incredible position.\n\nPark at Upper Kananaskis Lakes North Interlakes lot and hike for a half hour along the old fireroad(keep right) to the end of the lake then slog up the scree slope to the base of the slab above the boulder field. \n  \n Start as for Joy, and scramble the first 100m of slab to a steep black streak on the left wall. Climb its’ far left side and a traverse right to belay (5.6, 25m) Belay at the last shrub out left after about 300m of 5.3/4 climbing. Go back out right and up the corner to a belay. Continue up the corner for 6 pitches to a big ledge with a 2-bolt belay. Go up a broken gully and make a rising sweep on horribly loose rock(The Leprosy Pitch) up to a tiny alcove with the last bolt. Traverse up and right to the ridge. Either take the ridge to the summit or downclimb 15m to a notch and down to the backside scree which meets Joy. Hike off via a ramp to the meadows. \n  \n What we lugged up The Shining Path: many pitons, nuts, Tri-Cams, small-medium cams and 7 slings is likely enough as it’s more runout than Joy. The route was started in about 1998 and we had gotten half way up the slab at that point but a summer bear closure over a few sporatic weeks in the season prevented anything further until Tony came on board and the grizzly vanished.\n\nsee photos\nmany pitons, nuts, Tri-Cams, small-medium cams and 7 slings is likely enough as it’s more runout than Joy"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"KjAl8dP4XAOE3nvSKpw8CQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1681,50.6371]}},"createdBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","_change":{"user":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","historyId":"64134866f0cf0083295da888","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:48:38.204Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,1ab8e572-85c1-5235-b789-2f599bd38732,2a3025f1-d3f8-5c03-84de-7bd22a9c3c09","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Kananaskis","Mount Indefatigable"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1681,50.6371]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"KjAl8dP4XAOE3nvSKpw8CQ=="},"content":{"description":"Mt. Indefatigable possesses a gigantic slab that simply begs to be climbed. The rock quality is above average to stellar. The classic Joy (5.6, 10 pitches) route is the trade route and most people's objective. The Shining Path (5.7R?) shares the first pitch or two with Joy, then heads over the dihedral and onto the upper slab to follow a similar, yet smaller dihedral. Both routes have loose stone that accumulates on ledges and climbing under another party would be a poor decision. There is MUCH more loose rock on The Shining Path. Joy has many \"hiding spots\" if it gets windy and rocks come down. Joy also cleans up a bit after the season starts and it get's some traffic to clear off the loose stones on the ledges. \n  \n NO FIXED ANCHORS means retreating from either route would mean leaving a bunch of gear at best and downright terrifying if weather moved in and started spitting rocks down the face, which would be inevitable. So check the weather and plan accordingly. \n  \n The approach is a fairly easy with a hike on a flat trail for most of it followed by an uphill scree slog (45 minutes car-to-route). The descent isn't that bad either and there are two options. Bring bear spray as the main descent trail is permanently \"recommended\" closed due to \"prime grizzly habitat\". An alternate descent from both routes to avoid the \"bear habitat\" is a scree shoot that isn't terrible if the party descends together to minimize rockfall hazard. It's not nearly as easy as the Yam scree skiing, so be prepared to go slower.
