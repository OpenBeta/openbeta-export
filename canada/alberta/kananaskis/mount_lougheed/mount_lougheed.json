It even has a signpost as you pass it on the left side, showing it's might next to The Windtower and, in the distance, Mt Sparrowhawk. \n  \n There are two known rock routes and a good scramble. Lots of information on the scrambles are available and there is potential for exploration of this wall and the area (I was told there may be a 1000 lines possible in this cirque, of varying quality, of course)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","historyId":"6413486ef0cf0083295da8fe","prevHistoryId":"6413486df0cf0083295da8f3","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:48:45.108Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:34.320Z","updatedBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw=="}
