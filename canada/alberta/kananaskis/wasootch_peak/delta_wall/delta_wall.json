The rock is fantastic by Rockies standards and the protection is great. Some pitches can be combined, depending on your comfort for rope drag.  (Most logical to combine are P1 + P2, P3 + P4, then P7 to the tree before the large block on P8.  Rest of pitches should be done as is to maintain communication and avoid rope drag.)\n\nPitch 1: 25m 5.4 (3 bolts): Climb straight up through a few treed ledges\n\nPitch 2: 20m 5.4 (2 bolts): Climb slabs to the right of a right facing corner and then up and right to anchors.\n\nPitch 3: 25m 5.6 (5 bolts): Climb over small roof and then trend right to climb runnels.\n\nPitch 4: 15m 5.7 (3 bolts):\n\nPitch 5: 30m 5.8 (8 bolts): Climb up and left to first bolt and then straight up.\n\nPitch 6: 30m 5.6 (4 bolts): Up left to the first bolt and then trending right on gear and bolts.\n\nPitch 7: 20m 5.3 (No bolts): Up and right through shattered rock, staying away from loose gully. Finish just below large ledge.\n\nPitch 8: 35m 5.6 (2 bolts): Scramble up through some trees and then up the right side of a block. From here look for bolts on the wall above, climb straight up to a ledge.\n\nPitch 9: 25m 5.10c (9 bolts): Climb straight up from the belay on bolts. The crux comes at a small overlap, when the going gets tough, look left. Once through the crux, trend up and right.  No gear needed on this pitch - fully bolted.\n\nPitch 10: 20m 5.8 (4 bolts): Up and right around overlap and then back left.\n\nOnce near the base of the cliff, traverse left approx. 200m until you reach a scrappy left facing corner, I believe there was a cairn here. Scramble up the corner and slightly right to a tree that should have some cord on it for a short rappel on the descent. From the tree walk up hill until you reach the cliff and then traverse left about 5m to the base of the route and another cairn.\nMostly bolt protected, some pitches might require gear.  A small rack from .5-3\" is adequate. Bring runners if combining pitches. Single 60m rope will work for rappels.  All anchors have ring bolts."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"f28pu/U7XTmCtbXFGNcaog==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.11126,50.94757]}},"createdBy":"OQ6ung8UV4e9v9mLAqKLwg==","_change":{"user":"OQ6ung8UV4e9v9mLAqKLwg==","historyId":"6413487ff0cf0083295da996","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:49:03.149Z"},{"_id":"tw1FcrTGTiKxk3iDfAE1rA==","name":"More Cowbell","grades":{"yds":"5.7"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"J.

It has tons of loose rocks and small boulders that could be dislodged on rappel. It should not be climbed when there is a party above***\n\nNow that Ive got the disclaimer out of the way..........This is a sport route at an easy grade, most climbing is in the 5.5 range.  It is a great location and position, but.....Back to the hazards, In my opinion, the route is not worth the risk. The climbing is easy but the rappels have lots of potential for snagged ropes and rockfall.  Given the grade and the bolt protection this route will be a big draw for beginner climbers that may not have the needed experience that the objective hazard of the route requires. There are much better and safer route options for people who are looking for easy, bolt protected routes.\n\nP1:    26m, 5.5, 6 bolts\nP2:    30m, 5.6, 7 bolts\nP3:    28m, 5.4, 6 bolts\nP4:    26m, 5.5, 6 bolts\nHike 30m up and right through some trees to the base of a small right facing corner and a bolt a few meters up.\nP5:   30m, 5.6, 6 bolts\nP6:   30m, 5.5, 6 bolts\nP7:   30m, 5.6, 6 bolts\nP8:   28m, 5.5, 6 bolts and a pin if you want\nP9:   30m, 5.7, 11 bolts.  In my opinion the route should stop here as the rappel from the next pitch is the worst of a bunch of bad rappels\nP10: 27m, 5.4, 4 bolts, ring the bell!\n\nLocated on the buttress to the North of \"Daddys Day Out\"  Start of route is at a small group of trees, if you hit the gully you have gone too far\nBolt protected, all anchors ring bolts or chain.
