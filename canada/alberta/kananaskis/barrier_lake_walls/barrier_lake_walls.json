Approach by biking from Barrier Lake Dam for half hour plus then thrashing up through the woods for 15 minutes to the base of the rock.

Either continue up the corner(5.7) and move off right to a ledge with a bolt or leave the belay and traverse right then straight up(5.6). \n  \n 3.)

Grunt up it, pass a bolt, and try to clip a high pin or run it out left to the one-bolt ledge belay: falling here would be a nasty swing into the corner, however sustained, it’s not desperate. The pin is hard to clip. \n  \n 5.) Go up from the belay on fun rock directly above the anchor (5.9) to a tree belay.\n\nA gear list may include: TCUs and cams from 2”-3.5”, medium nuts/Tri-Cams, and a good assortment of pins.

Generally it goes up the slab just left of the huge corner system. The crux is pulling onto and over a buldgy slab on the first pitch, then an airy traverse under the huge overhang on the last pitch and judging from the photocopies sent in it looks highly entertaining, along with a short scenic approach, and a end-of-day crank at The Republik, should be a very fine day out. Bring a single rack to 4” and a 60m rope. \n  \n Park at Barrier Lake Dam. Cross the dam and take the trail along the lake, continue past Jewel Pass until below the first of two walls (30 min. by bike). Stash bikes and bushwack and scramble up a loose gully below the climb until reaching the 2 trees at the corner’s base(30min.). The descent is down the climb from the same anchors. Four long 30m raps reach the ground or walk off heading north and around through the upper forest. \n  \n 1.) Climb/scramble up water bowl until the base of the right-facing corner. Short 5.10(bolt) crux pull up on marginal holds gains good ground to the left of the corner. Thin slab moves towards the final steep section. Climb up right side of very loose arete to good ledge/bolt belay. (30m) \n  \n 2.) Climb right and slightly up towards corner(2 bolts). Climb corner towards small bush; go left onto slab climb over small ledges to second bolted belay. (30m) \n  \n 3.) Climb over small overhang and gain the bottom of the finger crack(5.8), go up the easy finger crack round the tree and over small ledges to gain a 2-bolt belay below the large overhang. (30m) \n  \n 4.) Climb around first overhang on the right side close to the main corner. Continue up the main corner until below the huge overhang. Traverse left across slab below overhang on good holds(5.9). At the end of the overhang, climb up and right to gain main left facing corner.
