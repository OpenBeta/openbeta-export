Continuing up on thinning ledges brings you under the roof. A well protected move (crux) brings you over the roof to a two-bolt station.\n\nP2, 30m: Climb a short wall to low angle slab with 3 bolts. Look to climbers right on another face with 3 bolts brings you to another two-bolt station.\n\nP3, 35m: Move up the slab (3 bolts) using a finger crack. Make an awkward move left under a bulge and again right to gain it. Continue up over the face and onto a big ledge. Walk 10m along base of final wall to a two-bolt station.\n\nP4, 35m: Move up left from the belay on easy ground to an overhanging roof (crux). Make a committing but protected move to gain the roof using a hidden pocket. A few more roof encounters bring you to a fun corner and up to a two-bolt station.\n\nRappel: Rap the 4th pitch. From the top of P3 rap directly down the mountain to a set of rings on a small ledge (30+m). From here rap to top of P1 and again to the start.\n\nNote: 10 quickdraws + a couple alpine draws. 70m rope. East facing wall.   \n\n\n\nDrive up Spray Lakes Rd 20 min past Nordic Center from Canmore. From the bridge at Goat Pond, walk 1.5 km along the shore to the High Rockies Trail. Turn left and walk another 250m to a large cairn on the right beyond where the power lines cross over the High Rockies Trail. Take the beaten path 450m up to the base of the wall. There is a 20m low class scramble with a fixed line up to the start of the climb. \n\nbolts and fixed stations"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"M5pa3T6aWvOg6ePrWiQ3Og==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.42602,51.02513]}},"createdBy":"d08+GS31UM6SSzC4cgDmgw==","_change":{"user":"d08+GS31UM6SSzC4cgDmgw==","historyId":"64134830f0cf0083295da5de","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:47:44.280Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,1ab8e572-85c1-5235-b789-2f599bd38732,339a5add-3e9a-5af3-a0e9-e3eb5a24373a","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Kananaskis","Goatview Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.42602,51.02513]},"bbox":[-115.42673490438227,51.02468033981814,-115.42530509561773,51.02557966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"M5pa3T6aWvOg6ePrWiQ3Og=="},"content":{"description":"Shaded and right across from Goatview Pond.
