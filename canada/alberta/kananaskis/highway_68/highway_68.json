A WI2 step up the left followed by a traverse to the right on steeper ice gets you to the top in about 10-12 meters.\n \nApparently the ice rambles onwards for another hundred meters or so where eventually it gets steep enough to be climbed again but we only did laps on the first pitch. Possible to create some difficult lines on thin and overhanging ice.\n\nMight be possible to set up a top rope with a lot of work without leading, but easier to just lead it.\n\nPark about 6.5km from the turn off from Highway 40 on the side of the road where it bends northwards with a frozen pond to the south. Cross the frozen pond southwards right down the middle to a cluster of trees obscuring the ice. From the south bank of the pond some ice should be visible, walk 2 minutes up the hill to the base of the first pitch. \nIce screws to comfort, tree anchor with directional needed for top rope."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"N9DCLPPEVy+gf9ndeNj+dw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.92951,51.05068]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"64134832f0cf0083295da5f9","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:47:46.979Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,1ab8e572-85c1-5235-b789-2f599bd38732,37d0c22c-f3c4-572f-a07f-d9dd78d8fe77","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Kananaskis","Highway 68"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.92951,51.05068]},"bbox":[-114.93022529870728,51.05023033981814,-114.9287947012927,51.051129660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"N9DCLPPEVy+gf9ndeNj+dw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.93022529870728,51.05023033981814],[-114.9287947012927,51.05023033981814],[-114.9287947012927,51.051129660181864],[-114.93022529870728,51.051129660181864],[-114.93022529870728,51.05023033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Highway 68 is a seldom used gravel road connecting Highway 1 to Highway 40, sporting some obscure ice climbing and possibly more."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134832f0cf0083295da5f9","prevHistoryId":"64134831f0cf0083295da5f3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:47:44.802Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:40.797Z","updatedBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g=="}
