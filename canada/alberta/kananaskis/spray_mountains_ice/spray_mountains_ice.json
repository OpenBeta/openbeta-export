With a relatively short approach and usually half decent ice, this route isn't a bad outing for the WI3 leader. Not sure how many folks continue up the gully, but I think deep snow wallowing often turns them back. There are several short ice steps and rambling pitches that can be climbed by following the gully up from the first pitch.\n\nLocated on the East Face of Mount Kent, Cobre Verde can be seen from Highway 40 near Kings Creek by looking west. 3.7 km west of Highway 40 on the Smith-Dorrien Spray Trail, park at the gate to the Correctional Facility and walk north about 0.8 km down the road through the storage lot to its end. Follow a climbers trail into the woods and angle up the second gully towards the ice.\nScrews, rap off tree to descend."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ty9hb9gWWTi1ohgcgo5rsg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.08723,51.03617]}},"createdBy":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","_change":{"user":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","historyId":"64134877f0cf0083295da944","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:48:55.113Z"},{"_id":"YWqVzHNHRIOdxCJgp5l7ZQ==","name":"Huh?!?","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":true,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"David Lee","length":4,"content":{"description":"Crux is serious, really prepare yourself mentally for this one.
