However generally the first 15 meters are a giant hanging dagger which needs to be circumvented on the right.\n\nP1 (20m): Scramble up a small ramp to a sloping belay ledge with one pin and a good crack to build an anchor. Make a few thin rock moves up slab with sparse protection until you gain a good crack and ledge to traverse left. Make a few moves left onto the rock ledge which gives way to ice where you can build a belay.\n\nP2 (10m): Head straight up some steep ice until you get to a 3 bolt sheltered belay stance on the left.\n\nP3 (30m): Cut out right from the belay and then straight up more steep ice for 20 meters until the angle eases and you finish at a bolted belay on the left.\n\nDescent: One 60m rappel *should* get you to the ground, always tie knots.\n\nAmadeus Falls is the obvious ice line seen from Hwy 40 where you park.
