From a large parking area just across the highway, a short trail leads to the enormous House Boulder, home to two boulder problems and a handful of sport routes. The House Area holds some of the hardest problems at Frank Slide, including Salacious (V8/9), Cartel (V9), and the infamous Railway (V10/11), a contender for the hardest problem at Frank Slide. The House Area also features some excellent moderate problems, such as Four Inch Pinch (V2), the short but fun Galactic (V4), the classic Aftermath (V5), and the pumpy Wild West (V5). Some of the boulders in the House Area are relatively protected from the wind, so these problems may be a good option on days when the Chinook winds are howling through the Crowsnest Pass."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134627f0cf0083295d92ae","prevHistoryId":"64134620f0cf0083295d924d","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:38:00.727Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:38:01.965Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
