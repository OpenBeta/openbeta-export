From there rap to a V thread at the top of the pillar (70s won't make it to the bottom) and then one final rap to the ground.\n\nFrom the parking area, follow the cutline West/Southwest to it's end at the mouth of the drainage.

To reflect this and bring it in line with climbs of similar difficulty (as well as personal experience on this climb and other WI5 routes) I have put a difficulty rating of WI5 on this entry.\n\nNote that the best time to climb Kemosabe in years where ice conditions are average is January/February. Earlier in the season it can be chandeliered, wet and largely unprotectable and later in the season the first pitch will generally melt out.  \n\nPitch 1 (50m) - Climb WI3/4 ice for 40 meters through a pinch in the rock where the ice can narrow to less than a meter in width. Build an ice belay where comfortable, bring up your partners and then walk into the amphitheater.\n\nPitch 2 (60m) -  Climb the rambling ice to the crux pillar and fire up vertical, mushroomed and aerated ice which can be hard to protect at time. Build an ice belay at the top.\n\nRappel from v threads.\n\nFrom the parking area follow the cut line West to its end and then drop down into the trees working your way West and gaining elevation until you are on a broad open scree hill/snow slope. <br /><br />Traverse the snow slope and Kemosabe will come into view on your right. Drop down into the drainage to the base of pitch 1. <br /><br />1 to 2 hours depending on conditions.\nStandard ice rack."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"tiApXqXXXMqzGbX2W0vSUw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.25629,51.38255]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"641349eef0cf0083295db6ab","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:55:10.224Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,b620295e-a5d7-5cca-b319-b5f65b4bd253","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Waiporous Creek"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.25629,51.38255]},"bbox":[-115.25701047349857,51.382100339818145,-115.25556952650147,51.38299966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"tiApXqXXXMqzGbX2W0vSUw=="},"content":{"description":"Waiporous Creek is an incredibly remote area North of the Ghost, encompassing a good number of seldom climbed ice climbs and huge potential for new rock routes in a spectacular setting.
