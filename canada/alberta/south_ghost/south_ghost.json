This area contains both excellent ice and rock routes and is worth the wear and tear on your vehicle to have a taste. \n  \n Pro's of the area: \n Awesome climbing for both ice and rockGenerally solid grey rockRemote Climbs and few crowdsAwesome campingLimitless potential for new routes \n Con's of the area: \n Remote, so rescue and cell phone usage are difficult to non-existant propositionsNot a lot of moderate rock routes (&lt;5.9)Road can be unpleasant to downright awfulThe occasional insane off-roader / atv'er / dirtbiker that you'll swear is trying to kill you with their drivingOccasional partying folks that trash their campsite \n  \n Camping / Etiquette \n While camping is unrestricted in many areas outside the national park boundary, it is imperative to tread lightly in this fragile ecosystem. Please use established fire rings, which are very abundant in the good camping spots. Pack out or burn all toilette paper. Bury all waste at least 200m away from any water source or better yet, pack it out in a ziplock. You're car camping (usually), so there is no excuse to leave anything behind. Some of the sites (at the bottom of the Big Hill in particular) frequently get trashed by people partying. Do a public service and burn their trash in your fire if you're camping in the area. \n  \n It is very helpful for climber relations and to maintain the degree of freedom we enjoy in the Ghost if we can leave this area in better condition than we found it, so pick up other's trash you may find."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641349e1f0cf0083295db625","prevHistoryId":"641349b4f0cf0083295db4d5","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:54:09.399Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:08.980Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
