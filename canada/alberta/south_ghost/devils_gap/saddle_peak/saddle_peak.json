Directly across from the wide valley of Lacy Gibbett is a steep curtain of ice easily visible from the fork. Approach up the drainage, skip the approach pitch by walking around (ultra thin) and make your way a few hundred meters of elevation up.\n\nPitch 1: M6/M7 10 bolts, 25m: climb excellent rock to a bolted anchor on the right side of the ice.\n\nPitch 2: Wi4+ 30 meter curtain takes you to the top. Set a directional off ice or small trees and head to a large tree on climbers left. 60 meter doubles will reach.\n\nDescent: rappel off tree to bolted anchor then to ground.\n\nTake devils gap trail for 2 hours from devils gap parking lot. Route will be high on Saddle mountain off to looker's left. Mixed pitch is not visible from valley.Â \n10 draws, ice rack"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"eCuo4yVkU+615AWWoZa9oA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.22065,51.26118]}},"createdBy":"PPI3hpSoXkGFCFrQhZU2dQ==","_change":{"user":"PPI3hpSoXkGFCFrQhZU2dQ==","historyId":"641349def0cf0083295db5fd","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:54:54.265Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,3c5a2976-61d2-5819-b92f-e4648602016a,1c8bf61a-76ab-5526-b188-e0c3a12ce79f,782ba8e3-2564-53ee-b5e4-0596a196bda0","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","South Ghost","Devil's Gap","Saddle Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.22065,51.26118]},"bbox":[-115.22136856953807,51.26073033981814,-115.21993143046194,51.26162966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"eCuo4yVkU+615AWWoZa9oA=="},"content":{"description":"Secluded."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641349def0cf0083295db5fd","prevHistoryId":"641349dcf0cf0083295db5f7","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:54:50.808Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:49.482Z","updatedBy":"PPI3hpSoXkGFCFrQhZU2dQ=="}
