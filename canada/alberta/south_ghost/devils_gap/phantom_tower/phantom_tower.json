From the top you can see both lake minnewanka and downtown Calgary. \n\nThis climb is graded 5.8 but keep in mind it's a 1975 5.8 \n\nPitch 1 5.7 climb the shattered corner next to the Carin till you reach the first anchor, \n\nPitch 2  5.5 climb down from the anchor and around the blind corner to the left, and follow the natural line.\n\nPitch 3 5.5 the easiest path up will lead you to a piton anchor \n\nPitch 4 5.6 continue following the diagonal line leading up and left\n\nPitch 5 5.7 climb the grooves up to an anchor on your right. Do not continue to follow the diagonal grooves left.  ( 17m )\n\nPitch 6 it's Crux time! use your 4-in cams sparingly, this section will be a little run out without them. \n\nPitch 7 you can climb the easier but unprotected slab face or you can climb the harder 5.9 corner crack \n\nPitch 8 pull through the many mini cracked roofs, this was the listed Crux in the guidebook \n\nPitch 9 climb the easy but loose 5'7 to the top! Be advised I was not able to find an anchor at the top probably because the top 10 m is giant detached blocks that provides questionable protection at best. Once you top out below well past the ledge and find something to make an anchor with... I used the Big blocks about 25 m away from the edge\n\n\n\nEnter the Ghost valley through the usual 4x4 shenanigans and then head Southwest towards the \"airstrip\". Drive around the berm and follow it until you reach the Banff national Park boundary sign. Park your car and then walk 100 m further past the sign and on your right hand side you'll see a carin, follow this trail up untill you reach another Carin. at the second carin stay left. And finally once you're above the bluffs you'll reach the third  carin (the one against the tree) stay right and hike up to the Clif side. Follow the cliffside until you reach phantom Tower. The base of the climb is marked with a carin and a PT scratched into the Rock next to it \n\nTrad with bolted anchors  <br /> Bring extra 4\" cams for pitch 6"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"xlmqn9OtXC+9pgcctcvYfQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.17464,51.29028]}},"createdBy":"/ytuah2RUBye+l5Z3/yekQ==","_change":{"user":"/ytuah2RUBye+l5Z3/yekQ==","historyId":"641349d0f0cf0083295db586","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:54:40.460Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,3c5a2976-61d2-5819-b92f-e4648602016a,1c8bf61a-76ab-5526-b188-e0c3a12ce79f,c659aa9f-d3ad-5c2f-bda6-071cb5cbd87d","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","South Ghost","Devil's Gap","Phantom Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.17464,51.29028]},"bbox":[-115.17535902482516,51.289830339818145,-115.17392097517482,51.29072966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"xlmqn9OtXC+9pgcctcvYfQ=="},"content":{"description":"Phantom Tower is a beautiful proud line at the intersection between devels gap and the ghost valley"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641349d0f0cf0083295db586","prevHistoryId":"641349cff0cf0083295db57f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:54:37.784Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:49.441Z","updatedBy":"/ytuah2RUBye+l5Z3/yekQ=="}
