Both contain a number of established climbs with some well protected moderates. The climbs vary from old school bold climbs that still need pins to protect to modern mixed (trad with bolts) climbs with good anchors. \n  \n The rock is very high quality grey rock. While the quality is generally good, loose rocks still abound on some ledges due to low traffic. Climbs are generally around 4 pitches. The approach isn't to bad (much better than the Yam approach) and there are several rap-off descent routes with bolts and rings."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641349d5f0cf0083295db5bc","prevHistoryId":"641349d3f0cf0083295db5a1","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:54:40.934Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:54:42.001Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
