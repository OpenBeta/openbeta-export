With its beautiful scenery it is a popular place in the summer but in the winter it is quite easy to be alone. In the summer there is lots of hiking and scrambling to be had. There is rock climbing as well but info is scarce and expect adventure as it is the typical Rockies Limestone. In the winter it is home to some classic ice climbs such as, Experts Choice, Sullivan Falls and Quick and Dirty. When the weather is too cold in the Central Rockies, look to Waterton as it is sometimes warmer due to strong winds that can form as Chinooks. When it blows (and it usually does), it really blows!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134a00f0cf0083295db75a","prevHistoryId":"641349fcf0cf0083295db735","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:55:10.706Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:14.301Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
