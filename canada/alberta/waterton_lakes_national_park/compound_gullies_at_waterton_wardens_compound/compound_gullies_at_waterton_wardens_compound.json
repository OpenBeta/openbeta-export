It’s 30 to 45 minutes hiking depending on your speed and the amount of snow on the approach.\n\nClimb 5 pitches of fairly mellow and fun WI2 ice (grading per Joe Josephson’s guidebook, the top pitch felt more like WI3 to me). There is avalanche hazard but there are opportunities to climb during low hazard periods. Be wary of wind slabs. Rap down using V threads. Josephson says it is possible to hike off on climbers left but looks unpleasant. Recommend double 60 or 70 metre ropes. We used double 60’s and it worked out ok. Don’t forget your headlamp!\n\nCheck out the ice climbs from the road into town.
