It is a very popular spot for groups, especially the summer camp across the street. Knob Hill Slabs have some of the best and most solid rock in the area, while the Quarry is a great place for a hot day. There are very easy routes at both areas. And it is only a 4 minute walk between the two areas. \n  \n The laid back angle and abundance of features means most routes are fairly straightforward.  Cruxes tend to be short. In general, Knob Hillâ€™s Slab and Quarry have a relaxed atmosphere with a short approach."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134577f0cf0083295d8c7a","prevHistoryId":"6413456ff0cf0083295d8c23","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:35:57.657Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:35:58.670Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
