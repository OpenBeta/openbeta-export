The name was from a note left at the base of the climb in the late 90’s, likely from one of any number of generational “first (re)ascents”.\n\nBecause this is one of the few true jam crack climbs around, it really shouldn’t be missed. The jamming is straight forward, although the start may swallow a bit more of your upper body than you may appreciate. At the top the best spot to belay is from the chains down and to the left of the big block. A long runner makes good protection for the traverse your second will have to complete. A scramble descent off to the left is possible. Nearby bolts make the crack feel a bit more “French” than is perhaps decent for a historic route and a rare area jam crack.  Bring gear to 3”.\n\n\n\nThe obvious crack. \n\nTrad.
