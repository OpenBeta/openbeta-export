This pitch goes about as much to the right as up. Climb through some choss and up to another ring bolt station. \n\nPitch 3 (5.9, 9 bolts, 29m) A sustained pitch on good rock! Climb up past 9 bolts to a ring bolt station nearly 30m above. \n\n**** WARNING **** A large section of rock fell off recently which makes pitch 4 less than desirable. I would recommend doing Straight Shooter route instead from here ... at least for now. We will hopefully get up there before the end of October 2022 to inspect that pitch and possibly re-bolt or re-route that pitch. I will update here when it gets fixed. Thanks!!\n\nPitch 4 (5.10a, 10 bolts, 34m) The Traverse Pitch! Head left for 6 bolts and then up for 4 more bolts. You might want an extendable draw on bolt 6 to reduce the rope drag. Keep heading up from the last bolt to find a pair of ring bolts for the belay station. \n\nPitch 5 (5.10d, 10 bolts, 50m) The Money Pitch! Some great rock and interesting moves make this the highlight! It is probably best to belay from near the tree at the base of this pitch. The first bolt is several meters up and the terrain up to the first bolt is relatively easy, but still it would be a good idea to anchor the belayer to the tree, at least until the climber has clipped a couple of bolts. \n\nPitch 6 (5.9, 8 bolts, 40m) An awkward move to the right to reach the first bolt and then some great exposure as you climb up and trend left. Then continue up towards the last ring bolt station! Be careful on the last few meters as there is a bit of loose stuff on the lower angled terrain at the end. \n\nDescent: Walk-Off from the top!! The walk off is great. Scramble up and south to crest the ridge and then head down any of the various game trails at this point. Fairly easy terrain down and south on the backside eventually gets you down to the river. Walk a bit west to get to the hwy, then head east across the bridge and along a walking path back to the parking lot. \n\nNote: Belay Stations are equipped with rappel rings in case you need to retreat (rappel), except at the top (assuming you will walk off if you make it to there)\n\n\n\nJust west of the town of Frank is a large pull-out Parking lot on the north side of hwy 3. Park here. From the parking lot, walk east, along the sidewalk, along the hwy. After the bridge, head north into the trees and up a ridge towards the Cliff!\n\nStay in the trees until you are underneath the climbing area and then head straight through the rocks to the cliff.\n\nAs for landmarks ... there are treed bowls along the middle of the cliff ... look for the one that just has 2 or 3 big trees, that's the one to aim for! See photo.\n\nBolted. Rap Hangers at each station if you have the need to rappel to retreat.

Follow the bolts to the overhang but trend right here for a slightly easy spot to break through and keep heading up. At the last bolt, go right through some easy but loose terrain to reach the bolted belay above.
