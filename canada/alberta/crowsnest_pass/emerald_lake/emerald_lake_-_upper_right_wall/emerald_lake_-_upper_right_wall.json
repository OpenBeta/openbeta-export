Follow the path of least resistance and clips a few bolts for safety as you cruise up to the ridge line for a nice walk off back down towards the lake!\n\n\n\nThis is an exit route from the Upper Walls to the ridge top so that you can walk off, down and around to the old road at the bottom. \n\nFrom the Lunch Log, walk north-ish along the base of the cliff. If you reach bolts with static rope hanging from them, then you have gone slightly too far. Backup a few meters and look up and right. Follow the easy angled, treed ledge up and right, probably more right than up, and look for 1/2 dozen bolts or so along this 55m pitch. Relatively straightforward 5th class scrambling, but since there cliff edge is so close and there is some loose terrain, it's nice to use a rope to stay protected in case of a slip.\n\nOnce on the top of ridge, follow a trail down the ridge. There's many animals trails here as well, and also multiple ways down, so test out your route findings skills!! :D\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBolted. 6 bolts.
