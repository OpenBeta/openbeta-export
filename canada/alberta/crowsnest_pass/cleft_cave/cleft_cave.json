Since then, it has seen a multitude of explorers and weekenders enjoying its simplicity of terrain and high-value experience. The cave itself is simple, easy to travel in, and uses no technical rope work. The feature that draws the multitudes is the lofty lookout points at the end. The cave entrance is in the right fork of Ptolemy Valley (The Promise Land), but the lookout points are two gallery-view-type windows in the middle of a cliff looking into the left fork of Ptolemy Valley (Andy Good Basin).\n\nIn 2022, a two pitch rappel route (17m and 30m) was established out of the gallery view window (stay right in the cave) by Daniel Vanderpyl and Nathan Shenton. Now you can retreat from the cave by rappelling out and walking through a different basin.\n\nThis makes for a cool multisport day!!\n\nBike &gt; Hike &gt; Rock Climb &gt; Cave &gt; Rappel out of Cave Window &gt; Alpine Lake Dip &gt; Hike/Bike out.\n\nThe rock is standard limestone. The 'Resident Goat' line is parallel to a seeping flow, which creates a darker, polished black runoff. The rock quality here is good, and agreeably aesthetic. The line is just to the right and slightly on this feature, then crosses it at the top where the anchor is just above the separate cave source. This climb would be better avoided on wet days or early spring.\n\nAs of posting this, the sport climbs at the entrance are in development. The most up-to-date details will be updated when it is fully finished in summer 2023. For now, though, enjoy 'Resident Goat' on lead, or 'Entrance Left' as a top rope.\n\nFor more information on caving in the area, including Cleft Cave, get in contact with the Alberta Speleological Association (ASS) or refer to:\n\nRollins, J.
