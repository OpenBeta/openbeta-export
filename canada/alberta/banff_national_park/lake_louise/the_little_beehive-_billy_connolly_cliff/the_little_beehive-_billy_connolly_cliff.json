The Billy Connoly Cliff is a section of lighter colored rock on the left side of Little Beehive, facing South. This wall seems seldom visited as it is harder to get to, requires a 1.5 hr approach hike, and there is much lower hanging fruit near by (The Back of the Lake areas). But, if you are the adventurous type and a bit weary of the crowds lower down, than this may be the wall for you. You will also be rewarded with some pretty amazing views of the lake and surrounding glacier-capped mountains. The rock is quartzite, there are only 3 Trad routes so far, gear anchors, good steep climbing on pretty solid rock. Prepare to do a little weeding on route. See the Banff Rock guidebook by Chris Perry for more information."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64133d64f0cf0083295d3a15","prevHistoryId":"64133d61f0cf0083295d3a0f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:01:33.597Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:40.650Z","updatedBy":"zXefci8mWqamB9mgAB9stw=="}
