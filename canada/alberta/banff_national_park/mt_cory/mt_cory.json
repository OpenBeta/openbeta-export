Cory has maybe the best limestone (quality wise) in the whole Banff area for multipitch climbing. Why this has happened is due to the glacier melt that carved most of the water polished slabs of Cory to a beautiful, solid slab. Most climbs are very sticky still, as the wind erodes the limestone quickly to a prickly pear type of rock with some very sharp jugs and corners.  \n  \n Mt. Cory is a huge mountain and has several approaches. See within the area descriptions to find the proper approach beta as not all trails connect to each other.  \n  \n Most climbs are found from a pull out which is before (approaching from Canmore/Calgary) a split in the road at about 3km after the Cave and Basin or Johnston Canyon turn off. The parking lot is on the south side (left, towards Banff) which is also a lookout. A faint trail leads you up to the 'Take it for Granite' area and others."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64133da8f0cf0083295d3c7f","prevHistoryId":"64133da4f0cf0083295d3c63","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:02:31.661Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:08.463Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
