This route gets sun at the top early in the day and is generally in good shape all season. The fatter it get's the more lines are available. Probably 3 independent routes are possible.\n\nOn the Trans-Canada heading west: <br /> Take the highway 1A exit just a few km's past Banff and the Norquay Ski Area. Follow the 1A west for a few km's past an interpretive trail sign with a grizzly on it on the north side of the road. Park in a pulloff on the other side (south) of the road about 100m past this sign. Walk another 100m further west down the road to the first creek drainage (with a pipe running under the road) and follow it north all the way up to the climb. About 15 minutes for the approach. The ice isn't visible until you're there.\nScrews. Tree with tat at top. Apparently bolts somewhere, but I never saw them."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"8UCw3YY4Whm0hlsJh3HRrA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.6665,51.1718]}},"createdBy":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","_change":{"user":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","historyId":"64133e3bf0cf0083295d4264","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:05:15.940Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,f140b0dd-8638-5a19-b486-5b098771d1ac","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Sawback Range (ice)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.6665,51.1718]},"bbox":[-115.66721717588709,51.17135033981814,-115.66578282411288,51.172249660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"8UCw3YY4Whm0hlsJh3HRrA=="},"content":{"description":"Containing such classic ice lines as: \n Bearspirit \n Step Right Up \n Johnston Canyon"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64133e3bf0cf0083295d4264","prevHistoryId":"64133e3af0cf0083295d425e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:05:13.527Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:41.287Z","updatedBy":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ=="}
