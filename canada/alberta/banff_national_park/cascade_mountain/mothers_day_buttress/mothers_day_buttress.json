The descent is not trivial and requires about 1.5 hours, but is relatively straightforward. The climb follows the buttress all on generally good rock with excellent pro opportunities.

Walk up the road for about 100m to an obvious gravel slough. Head up the gravel creekbed for about 5 minutes watching on the right for a good climbers trail marked with a cairn. Follow this trail to a rock outcropping. Scramble up (easy) staying on the right side of the BIG gulley.

The first pitch is quite chossy, but the last pitch involves stellar stemming on better rock. The crux pitch (second pitch) is well protected with fixed gear (bolts), but starts off the deck (ledge) and is a bit sketchy for that reason. The route can be rappelled with a single 60m rope.\n\n1st Pitch- 45m- 5.9/ The first pitch contains the worst rock on the route. Start up the easy dirty corner. As the ground stiffens, you come across two bolts. Make several 5.9 moves past these bolts on bad rock. Angle back left into the corner and then back right following a few old pitons up some more chossy rock, turning the arête to the right where there is a decent belay ledge below a bulging wall with a fixed belay below the bolts that start the next pitch. Before you turn the arête, you run across the actual last rappel station for this route, which involves fixed pins. The fixed belay below the bulge is not set up to rap as it is hard to get to from the rap line.\n\n2nd Pitch- 15m- 5.10c/ This short pitch is the crux of the route. Follow the bolts (three) from the belay as they traverse up and left over some slightly overhanging slab moves at the grade. Once you can get your hands on the handrail (small ledge) above, monkey over left to the right facing corner and mantel up. Follow the corner placing good gear to its top. Then make a few run out slab moves up and right to the fixed belay/rappel.\n\n3rd Pitch- 25m- 5.8/ This is the most uneventful of the four pitches. Move up about 15’ to a ledge that leads left through a bit of choss to the base of a significant left facing corner. Follow the corner (crack out left) up to a bolt and gear belay on a ledge in the corner proper.\n\n4th Pitch- 45m- 5.8/ This is the best pitch of the route and makes it worthwhile in my opinion. Follow the corner up for less than 20’, which would be a bit chossy if you had to continue up it. Find the great cracks out on the right wall (1” gear). Stem wide and follow those cracks up the right wall until you can turn the arête of that wall out right onto a small ledge below low angled slab. There is a bolted rap station here. Continue up past the rap station, eventually moving back into the corner (large gear) and finish on easy ground to a rap/belay station on the left wall.\n\nMother’s Day Buttress is located about 1 km east on the Lake Minnewanka road from the first TransCanada exit for Banff when traveling west/north bound. Once you exit, turn right and cross the cattle guard and park in the first paved pullout you come to on your right. Walk down the road another .2kms to a drainage on the left side. Step into the drainage and follow it north for a short distance looking for a cairn on the right bank. From this cairn, pick up a faint trail that continues north and works its way up to the tree line which overlooks the main drainage down to the left. Scramble up one short section and then circumvent the wall to the right on a faint trail. Wait to gain any more elevation until you have crossed under a large dark roof and can see the left facing corner that makes up the first pitch of Oedipus Complex. Bushwhack through a few trees and scramble up at a rightward angle to the base of this corner. There is one bolt to assist in the first belay at the base of this chossy corner.\nStandard rack to 4\""},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"zI4PKA2RUHGKfOOHSB5sjg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.5373,51.2139]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"64133a0ef0cf0083295d2ce7","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T15:47:26.063Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,2e2ebf39-f34d-5620-9ceb-e9260a8f0b14,cc8e0f28-0d91-5071-8a7c-e387481e6c8e","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Cascade Mountain","Mothers Day Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.5373,51.2139]},"bbox":[-115.53801783143649,51.21345033981814,-115.53658216856351,51.21434966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"zI4PKA2RUHGKfOOHSB5sjg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.53801783143649,51.21345033981814],[-115.53658216856351,51.21345033981814],[-115.53658216856351,51.21434966018187],[-115.53801783143649,51.21434966018187],[-115.53801783143649,51.21345033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Great grey rock and only minutes from Banff.
