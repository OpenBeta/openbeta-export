A new variation keeps the grade at 5.9 but over all makes the route easier. There is some argument over the grade of the original route, as some people feel it is more like 10b instead of 5.9. Pitches can be combined, just bring more draws; pitch 1 on its own (40m), then link two at a time. \n\nAll anchors are fully bolted. \n\nThe variation starts on pitch three. From the pitch 2 belay, clip one protection bolt and head left (original route climbs straight up). This variation is 5.7 and ends at the pitch 4 anchors of the original route\n\nPitch 1: 40m, 5.6\n\nPitch 2: 25m, 5.9\n\nPitch 3: 25m, 5.8\n\nPitch 3 Variation: 55m 5.7\n\nPitch 4: 25m, 5.9\n\nPitch 5: 25m, 5.8\n\nPitch 6: 25m, 5.6\n\nPitch 7: 25m, 5.7\n\nRappel the route\n\n\nThe approach trail dumps you right at the base of the route. From here, scramble straight up for approx. 10m. When you get to a scrappy ledge system, traverse left for another 10m stepping across a gap, you should see the bolts for the belay\nDozen draws and a few runners. All belays are two bolts with rings."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"iIdx6N6rU+GyV3bjepakaQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.53898,51.22541]}},"createdBy":"OQ6ung8UV4e9v9mLAqKLwg==","_change":{"user":"OQ6ung8UV4e9v9mLAqKLwg==","historyId":"641339bff0cf0083295d2a87","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T15:46:07.997Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,2e2ebf39-f34d-5620-9ceb-e9260a8f0b14,888771e8-deab-53e1-b257-76e37a96a469","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Cascade Mountain","Bankhead"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.53898,51.22541]},"bbox":[-115.53969801093771,51.22496033981814,-115.53826198906229,51.22585966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"iIdx6N6rU+GyV3bjepakaQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.53969801093771,51.22496033981814],[-115.53826198906229,51.22496033981814],[-115.53826198906229,51.22585966018187],[-115.53969801093771,51.22585966018187],[-115.53969801093771,51.22496033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Sunny south facing cliff.
