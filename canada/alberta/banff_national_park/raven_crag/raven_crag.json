Good handholds and squeezing your body under the arête makes the climb not only a lot of fun but also easier than it looks. \n  \n Pitch 6: (5.10d, 11 bolts, 30m) \n Climb this steep, pumpy, and pretty sustained flake system. The crux is where the flake becomes more narrow -- rest whenever you can. \n  \n Pitch 7: (5.7, 7 bolts, 35m) \n Low angle and easier climbing leads to a medium size smooth face -- height can be of advantage to climb onto it.\n\nTake the same approach as Plutonian Shores.

When you can see the anchor of Pitch 2 quite far on the left, look up and a bit right, you should see the anchor of Pitch 3, just scramble up using the 2 bolts to get to the anchor. <br />  <br /> After pitch 7, don't rappel down due to rock fall. This final anchor is shared with Plutonian Shores.  Walk off to the left and up and eventually following the path to the back of the mountain. Follow the cairns down -- same as Plutonian Shores.\nBring 20 or more quickdraws, definitely you will need at least a hand-full of long ones.

Slab moves but nothing is hard as there are a lot of jugs to help the slab. No friction moves really.  \n  \n P2: The Battle of the Bulges, 5.7 \n  \n Things start heating up a bit where you have to start thinking. Long pitch, would not try to combine with the other pitch unless you had a lot of draws and they were doubled.  \n  \n P3: The Castling Move, 4th \n P4: Left Left Right, 5.8 \n  \n We combined these two pitches as the 4th class is direct and can easily be extended with one draw on the anchor. However, a fall if you do this may land you on the ledge so YMMV.  \n  \n P5: A Murder of Crows, 5.8 \n  \n Great! Starts into a corner and becomes really exposed quite quickly. Great fun at the grade.  \n  \n P6: Billy the Destroyer, 5.9 \n  \n I would tend to agree this was the 'hardest' pitch, which is pretty subjective. To me, it felt like the hard bit lasted a short move and was just about finger strength. If you can pull on a good crimp you should be okay. Very fun and somewhat committing as you are more in a sustained flow than the other pitches. \n  \n P7: The Cooler, 5.8 \n  \n One hard move up a big step leads to very easy climbing. A friction slab can easily be avoided by avoiding one bolt. Overall, nothing great but a fun quick end.  \n  \n To do it again I'd bring more draws and perhaps link these piches: \n  \n 2/3, 4/5, 6/7 with a 80m rope or an uncut 70.
