All belays are fixed with bolts. \n  \n Pitches are described as per the topo given below. \n  \n                        Brewer Buttress topo       \n  \n P1:  40m, easy fifth. Follow broken rock up and left. In my opinion this was the only bad pitch on the route.  \n  \n                        The first pitch of the route (this was by far the worst pitch)       \n  \n P2:  30m, 5.5. Continue to a belay on a large ledge on top of the pedastal. \n  \n                        Pitch 2 (5.5)       \n  \n P3-4:  55m, easy fifth. Follow a break up and right past a station to a belay on top of a small ledge. These pitches are typically linked. \n  \n                        Pitches 3 and 4, seen here, are usually combined. Glenn T. is seen at the belay at the top of pitch 2.       \n  \n P5:  35m, 5.5. Climb up a broken wall to a good ledge and a belay anchor. Continue left along the ledge around the corner and belay there.  \n  \n                        Pitch 5 (5.5)       \n  \n P6:  30m, easy fifth. Climb up and right to belay at the base of a left facing corner. Belay here or link with pitch 7. \n  \n                        Pitch 6       \n  \n P7:  25m, 5.6. Climb to the top of the corner and move right to the belay. \n  \n                        Looking up the steep 5.6 corner of pitch 7. Nice pants Glenn :-)       \n  \n                        Although only rated 5.7, the route is very steep with lots of exposure. Great fun!   This is the view looking down the corner on pitch 7.       \n  \n P8:  25m, 5.5. Climb another left facing corner to a ledge. \n  \n P9:  40m, 5.7. Climb a right facing corner over a bulge. Continue up the corner to a belay. \n  \n                        Pitch 9, the crux of the route at 5.7       \n  \n P10:  20m, fourth class. Climb easily up a slab by wall to a belay at the base of a steeper wall. This pitch can be linked with the previous one. \n  \n P11: 35m, 5.6. Climb up through a steep section then more easily to belay at a good ledge. \n  \n P12:  40m, 5.6. Climb up a corner then move right onto a steep wall that leads to the top of the cliff. Finding an anchor at the top of this pitch is difficult, as is hearing your partner.  \n  \n                        The right finish (recommended) takes this steep wall (5.6) on pitch 12.       \n  \n Alternate finish: \n  \n P12-13:  35m, 15m. Follow the corner to a belay, then climb the short wall above to the top of the cliff.\n\n\nEither approach to the upper cliffs is viable for Brewer Buttress. Though the hut approach is probably quicker overall, I find the Rockbound Lake approach to be more enjoyable. See the Castle Mountain page for details on both of these approaches.\n\n<strong>The Hut approach</strong>\n\nBrewer Buttress is visible from the hut as the last buttress before the Eisenhower Tower.\n\n              <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106073057\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://mountainproject.com/assets/photos/climb/106073057_medium_1558471259.jpg?cache=1558471260\"></a>         <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106073057\"><em>Glenn T. in front of the Castle Mountain hut.</em></a>      \n\n\nFrom the hut on Goat Plateau, follow the trail east along the base of the cliff until you reach a bay on the right side of the buttress.

The walk is likely farther than you will think. The correct gully is typically marked with a large cairn or multiple cairns.  Descend a loose trail until the gully narrows, where the first rappel anchor is found to skiers right.\n\n              <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106073091\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://mountainproject.com/assets/photos/climb/106073091_medium_1558471276.jpg?cache=1558471277\"></a>         <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106073091\"><em>The correct descent gully.</em></a>      \n\n\nA mix of climbing and single rope rappels leads to the base of the gully and Goat plateau.

Auger, P. Sheehan, C. White","length":303,"content":{"description":"Freed in 1987, The lower tier of Brewer Buttress hosts one of Castle's best moderate routes: Ultra-Brewers. This rock climb is a full on 5.9 which offers continuous climbing in the 5.8 and 5.9 grade. Only 2 out of 7 pitches feature climbing in the 5.7 range, everything else being above that grade.\n\nFrom the ground, locate a small off width that reeks of feces with a bolt to the right (very near the ground) and two to the left of the bulge on the off width. This is the first pitch and the only bad one of the day.\n\nPitch 1 \"The Poop pitch\": Climb up into the chimney until it becomes an off width and a bulge roof. Clip a bolt and either pull the roof (5.8) or face climb (5.8) to the next bolt. Trend right following the poop-crack to a belay, clip it, and make an airy, unprotected traverse (5.6) to a couple of pins. If rope drag allows, continue up into the unprotected chimney (low 5th, loose) to the bolted belay. If not, belay from the pins (back it up).\n\nPitch 2 \"We've survived\": Continue into the loose chimney until you move around the corner. Be wary of rope drag as you move up and clip a bolt. Rock quality starts as mediocre and becomes excellent grey rock typical of Rockies limestone. Beautiful edging continues upwards through bolts veering left. Mantle onto the scree ledge and belay from a massive bolted boulder.\n\nOnce the second has reached the belay, put away the rope and walk left on the well traveled path . A cairn may be present between two very small trees that marks the start of the next pitch. \n\nPitch 3: Pull a low, loose roof to gain sold rock. Great, 5.8 edging is marred by a lack of protection (PG 13) until reaching a ledge. Move right into the obvious corner and belay at a block with a bolted anchor.\n\nPitch 4: Climb flaring cracks with marginal protection to a \"à cheval\" block on top of a pinnacle. Sit on it for a second contemplating why you chose climbing over polo. Make an airy right traverse on good holds aiming for a high tree. Mantle and belay in the enclave that contains the bolt and fiddly-protection crack system (I used a 0.4 X4).\n\nPitch 5: A much looser version of pitch four continues up and through a wide notch (how we climbed it) or hard right through a grassy corner. Belay below the giant detached pinnacle.\n\nPitch 6 \"The money pitch\": Remember when you climbed through the smelly first pitch? Well, consider giving this pitch to the brave soul who lead that. This pitch is the reason you should climb this route! Start going up to the detached pinnacle. Do some wide moves (#4-5 works well here, or clip a rusty pin) and either wrestle the wideness or move to the face. Continue up to the top of the pinnacle. Do not stop! Eye up the impressive rock formation above you and aim for the bolt. 4 bolts with basically no gear between them make up about half of this 40m pitch! Great edging and giant ledge hands gets you to a hanging bolt anchor near a small ledge.\n\nPitch 7 \"Stay gold\": Right off the bat you are immediately confronted with some really good 5.8 flaring left corner climbing. The rock quality continues to be good and gear gets much better as it continues on. Trend right under a small roof and make a short traverse to great, easy grey stone. Belay at bolts.\n\n\nTime from lookout: about 30-45 mins \n\nFrom the Fire lookout: Catch either a trail going up or one going left. We took the left one.\n\nYou'll probably see the approach to the midway hut (2016 one bolt and a red piece of duck tape marks the bottom of the last rappel). Continue past this crossing a large drainage.\n\nContinue onwards and cross about 2 more major scree drainages, navigating the best you can. Mostly, there are easy to spot trails on either side to aim for. One has a rockstep that is 3rd class at best.\n\nContinue on for quite a while on a good trail that skirts the edge of the cliff. Watch for bolts. You'll come to one really low bolt at about 1 meter and two left of it at about 5 and 8 meters. A wide, smelly crack also is easy to recognize. You should also be able to see \"Castles in the Sky\" prow to your right. If the trail becomes much less obvious, you have gone too far.\n\nCoordinates of base of pitch: 51.2973285, -115.9294355\n\nCams from smaller than fingers through #4 (#5 if you really want to haul it up for the money pitch). Slings to thread pins if you trust that sort of gear. About 5 quickdraws for the bolts. <br />  <br /> If you want to double up gear: go for more in the 0.3-.75 range. Extra #1 or #2 are optional and more or less useful.  <br />  <br /> Most anchors are really good bolts and so bring whatever you want for that. Two ropes lets you easily bail off this route if weather hits.\nOnce you top out, either keep going up to Brewer Buttress or walk climber's left towards the hut.  <br />  <br /> If you are at the hut, keep going left and follow cairns down to the base of the cliff.  <br />  <br /> If you decided to keep going to the top, either exit via the decent gully (second huge gully, pretty far (about 20-30 mins walking) and do the rappels. I'd consider picking up Banff Rock as the pictures are much more detailed in that book."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"H+YNA0MpW3O41RHTxRJ2ow==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.9301,51.3006]}},"createdBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","_change":{"user":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","historyId":"64133a14f0cf0083295d2d36","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T15:47:32.473Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,1fe60d03-4329-5b73-b8d5-11d3c51276a3","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Castle Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":6,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":2,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":2,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.9301,51.3006]},"bbox":[-115.93081918647101,51.30015033981814,-115.92938081352901,51.30104966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"H+YNA0MpW3O41RHTxRJ2ow==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.93081918647101,51.30015033981814],[-115.92938081352901,51.30015033981814],[-115.92938081352901,51.30104966018187],[-115.93081918647101,51.30104966018187],[-115.93081918647101,51.30015033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"A landmark in the Bow Valley with it's distinctive shape, Castle Mountain (2766m) is located just north of Castle Junction, about midway between Banff and Lake Louise where Highway 93 intersects the Trans-Canada highway. Amenities at Castle Junction include a campground and a hostel, as well as a small store which sells some basic groceries.  \n  \n A distinctive ledge system on Castle Mountain, called Goat plateau, splits the upper and lower cliffs. A tiny and novel hut on Goat plateau provides quick access to the climbs on the upper cliffs. See the alpine club for reservations. \n  \n At the southeast end of the upper cliffs is an isolated tower, named Eisenhower Tower. \n  \n Though there are many climbing routes on Castle Mountain,by far the most popular are Brewer Buttress and the south east face of Eisenhower Tower, both on the upper cliffs. I recommend purchasing the excellent guidebook Bow Valley Rock for additional beta on rock-climbing routes in the Banff/Lake Louise area, including routes on Castle Mountain. \n  \n I have found the limestone on Castle Mountain to be some of the best I've climbed on in the Canadian Rockies, though it can still be loose and crumbly in spots."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ==","historyId":"64133cf9f0cf0083295d36b8","prevHistoryId":"64133a14f0cf0083295d2d36","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T15:47:26.949Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:27.338Z","updatedBy":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ=="}
