All pitches go at around 5.11, with some committing friction moves and healthy bolt spacing (10-13ft) in places. \n\nP 1: Straight up the slab on small edges to a station at a small ledge.\n\nP 2: Committing moves off the anchor with poor feet lead to easier climbing above and a rightwards traverse along a ledge to the belay.\n\nP 3: The crux pitch. Sustained 5.11 climbing for 35 meters up a blank slab. Tiny but fragile crimps provide occasional relief between sections of pure friction climbing.\n\nFollow the approach for Sistine Slab. Before reaching the trees, head West off the ridge. Spot the final station on a ledge at the top of the slab, with the rest of pitch 3 visible below. A Hope and a Prayer is the only bolted route on Sistine Slab at this time.\nBolts. Route is set up to walk off the top rather than rappel."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"76BxLbbRXgG4qc9/Wpw2tw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.56413,51.13109]}},"createdBy":"jxGE7wUlU7C7x7+vces1tQ==","_change":{"user":"jxGE7wUlU7C7x7+vces1tQ==","historyId":"64133e49f0cf0083295d42d0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:05:29.857Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,efa0712d-b6d1-5e01-b8a9-cf7f5a9c36b7","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Sistine Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.56413,51.13109]},"bbox":[-115.56484654348701,51.130640339818136,-115.563413456513,51.13153966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"76BxLbbRXgG4qc9/Wpw2tw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.56484654348701,51.130640339818136],[-115.563413456513,51.130640339818136],[-115.563413456513,51.13153966018187],[-115.56484654348701,51.13153966018187],[-115.56484654348701,51.130640339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"West facing slabs off the ridge of Sulphur Mountain, approximately 2km (45min hike) South of the Gondola top-station.
