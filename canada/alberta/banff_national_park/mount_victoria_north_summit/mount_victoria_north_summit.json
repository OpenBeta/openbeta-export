In mid August we crossed the bergschrund on climbers right, encountering a 2-3m step of vertical snow/ice, where we found a second tool helpful.  Scramble up the black band of rock (3-4th class) to the col.  From the col work your way along the ridge on rock or snow.  The ridge gradually gets steeper, climbing loose 3rd-4th class rock, then finally a short 10m section of 5.3 climbing on solid rock protected by a single piton.  From there scramble the rest of the way to the summit.  Alternatively the rock can be bypassed on the right on 45 degree+ snow/ice. \n  \n Descent is to downclimb the route, with a few rappels set up if you need them (rock step, just below the rock step, and over the bergschrund).\n\n1 fixed piton on the 5.3 rock step.
