I wish I was kidding.\n\nDespite the suffering one must endure to get to the route and to also get back to their vehicle, the climbing itself is worth the suffering.\n\nP1. WI3-4 (20m) - Climb an initial steep step that eases off to an ice belay before the snow slope.\n\nSlog up 70 or so meters up the snow slope to the base of the main ice of the route.\n\nP2. WI3-4 (50m) - Climb good ice up to a cave on the right with a bolted station behind the pillar/curtain. If the cave is not accessible, either hack your way back there or suffer a terrible hanging belay. Alternatively if you have 70s just continue up the pillar and belay from the top of the pillar.\n\nP3. WI5 (65m) - Fire up the steep crux pillar to easier rambling ice followed by one final steep step to the very top. \n\nRappel on v threads to descend.\n\n\n\nApproach: From the parking lot follow the obvious and signed trail heading south down the valley for about 1.5 km until you come across the second obvious drainage to your right. Head up the drainage staying to the right out of the avalanche path for as long as possible until getting to the base of the route. If you can't see the top of the route after about 10-15 minutes of heading up the right side of the drainage, you are probably in the wrong one or way too far right. \n\nStandard ice rack."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"XSEPPm3aUsWR4xpQwDyMMg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.55456,51.12873]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"64133e54f0cf0083295d4311","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:05:40.070Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,5d210f3e-6dda-52c5-91e3-1a50c03c8c32","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Sulphur Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.55456,51.12873]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"XSEPPm3aUsWR4xpQwDyMMg=="},"content":{"description":"Sulphur Mountain is the relatively small mountain next to Banff, overshadowed by its much bigger neighbor, Mt.
