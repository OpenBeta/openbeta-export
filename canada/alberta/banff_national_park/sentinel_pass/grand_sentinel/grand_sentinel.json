Work a corner then pull a roof. Be careful of loose blocks. \n  \n P1: Low 5th class, 15m. Start around the left corner and climb a short pitch to a ledge with a bolted belay.  \n  \n P2: 5.7, 20m. Cracks and face climbing lead to another bolted belay at a small ledge below the obvious right facing corner.  \n  \n P3: 5.8, 25m. Climb the corner past a bulge to a bolted belay at a ledge.  \n  \n P4: 5.9, 25m. Climb cracks straight above the belay to the summit. An easier version goes left at about 5.4.\n\nThis route is on the south side of the Grand Sentinel. <br />  <br /> Approach Note: be careful scrambling along the talus on the left side after dropping down from the pass, the last time I was there in Aug, an entire 50m wide section started sliding/avalanching. The hiker's trail to the right side of the valley is probably safer and only an additional 10 mins.\nStandard rack, .3 to 4.
