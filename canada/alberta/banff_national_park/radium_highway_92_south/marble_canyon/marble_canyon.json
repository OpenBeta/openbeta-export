A full 30 meters of steep ice the bottom is often overhanging, with the top half easing off. The finish to the fencing at the rim of the canyon involves a couple easy mixed/rock moves.\n\nBuild an anchor either off the fence posts or the trees further up and rappel into the canyon floor. Watch out for thin ice early season, sometimes it might be better to simply lower the climber and belay up top instead of risking falling through the ice.\n\nAlternatively, rappel in, pull the rope and commit to leading out. Be sure you can climb out however or you will be stuck down in the canyon otherwise.\n\nThe obvious pillar of ice that can be seen from the 5th bridge across the canyon. Walk across the 5th bridge and set up a rappel on the East side of the canyon.\nStandard ice rack."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"XAs4hLJsUv6bfQHo4GWWIw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.12742,51.19006]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"64133e00f0cf0083295d3fcc","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:04:16.878Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,50d3c63e-fc68-5f5e-9a9c-dbbbe4fcb001,5c0b3884-b26c-52fe-9b7d-01e8e0659623","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Radium Highway (92 South)","Marble Canyon"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.12742,51.19006]},"bbox":[-116.12813746002335,51.18961033981814,-116.12670253997665,51.19050966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"XAs4hLJsUv6bfQHo4GWWIw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.12813746002335,51.18961033981814],[-116.12670253997665,51.18961033981814],[-116.12670253997665,51.19050966018186],[-116.12813746002335,51.19050966018186],[-116.12813746002335,51.18961033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Marble Canyon in Kootenay National Park, BC, Canadian Rockies, not to be confused with Marble Canyon of the Pavilion Mountain Range interior British Columbia, offers an exceptional (minimal avalanche) ice climbing experience. Marble Canyon, carved deep by Tokkum Creek, used to be one of the more visited tourist stops along Highway 93 which cuts through the Canadian Rockies from Radium Hot Springs to Castle Mountain. However, several years ago a wildfire ravaged the area and it remained closed until the dead timber could be managed. It has reopened and today it represents a barren but slowly recovering landscape in the winter until you rappel into the mighty depths of Marble Canyon to the active Tokkum Creek flow, then the fun starts.\n\nRoutes in Marble Canyon are all accessed via a rappel in from the top of the canyon between the 5th and 6th bridges, and require a 70m rope or doubles. A 60m rope rappel will not make it to the canyon floor without a big extension."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64133e00f0cf0083295d3fcc","prevHistoryId":"64133dfff0cf0083295d3fc6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:04:14.642Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:28.176Z","updatedBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g=="}
