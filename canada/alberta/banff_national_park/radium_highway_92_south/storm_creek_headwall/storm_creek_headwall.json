Unfortunately, the route can't be seen until you are nearly to it, and to get a good look, you might want to walk along the East Face before you climb up to the bench and the base of the route. \n P1, 30m:  climb easy ice if it's in, otherwise it's easy mixed climbing with marginal pro.  Set up a belay in a cave. \n  \n P2. M6+, 35m:  traverse left from the belay, hopefully on ice, then up to a left leaning crack that takes good gear.  If there is no ice, the traverse is on very poor rock, protected by two fixed knife blades.  Continue up the crack on decent gear to left-facing corner capped by a big roof.  Place a bomber stopper and traverse left on good flakes and edges to another crack.  The difficulty eases off as you follow this to a decent ledge and a two bolt anchor. \n  \n P3, M6+, 35m:  from the belay, climb the slot past two fixed pins.  After the 2nd, move left on flakes and edges to a crack system which continues up and left to a bolted station.  The protection is a little sparse toward the end of the pitch, but the climbing is easier. \n  \n P4, M5, 25m:  climb up then left to a belay at the base of the ice, passing one of the rappel stations along the way. \n  \n P5, WI5+, 40m:  climb steep ice that gets easier higher up, to a ledge and sheltered belay. \n  \n P6, WI4+, 25m:  climb sometimes thin but good ice to the top.  Build an anchor on the ice.\n\n         Dave traversing past rotten rock on P2.\n\nThis is the rightmost route accessed from the bench above the major rock band on the east face.  The descent is as follows. <br /> Rappel #1:  almost 60m to the bolted station at the top of the buttress. <br /> #2:  about 50m to a two-nut station at a stance. <br /> #3:  a free hanging rappel to the ground.\n10 - 12 screws, set of stoppers, double set cams from smallest C3 to #1 C4, and a #2 and #3.

Silmarillion Indirect becomes obvious through the trees after about 1:45 of hiking. You'll be hoping there's a track in by now! Silmarillion cuts a line trending leftward toward two strips of ice, you'll end up climbing the left one. P1, low angle, snow covered rock, with a few bolts (good luck finding them) gets you to a steeper corner with a nice two bolt belay. P2, again, trends leftward. Follow your nose up a nice corner a pin and some gear deposit you at another belay you'll have to build yourself. P3 looks low angle, but feels steep. You should find just enough gear... eventually, you'll be able to tap your tools into some thin ice that feels like bomber sticks! Climb some of the nicest thin ice you'll ever find and belay a the base of the pillar off of good long screws. P4, cruise up the nice steep pillar on good ice. Now rap off of a thread straight down to the bottom of the pillar, build another thread here and rap again. You'll find a less than amazing rap anchor straight below.
