The massive rock face is a 300 m mostly vertical toe of Stanley Peak that runs NW/SE. The rock is absolutely immaculate; climbing is very technical/balancey. \n  \n The wall faces NE; it only gets sun in the morning. The crag is in a dip in the scree which offers limited protection from the wind; plan on having great climbing conditions, and cold-ish belays. There is a creek/waterfall less than 50 m from the crag; as you might expect, this means there will be rock fall from snow melt in early season (the glacier is farther up the valley)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64133e0df0cf0083295d404b","prevHistoryId":"64133e0bf0cf0083295d4045","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:04:26.291Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:08.686Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
