Cross the crevassed glacier aiming for the right side of the obvious serac. \n\nClimb up the gully between the ice and rock (snow gully earlier in the season) to a steep step of ice at the top. Climb over this step to access the upper icefield. \n\nSeveral option exist for accessing the ridge. Depending on snow conditions you may be able to the climb moderate snow gully directly above to access the ridge. however if this is not an option or a cornice is present, you can either climb the low 5th class rock to the ridge, or if conditions allow, climb up the snow slope on the right and gain the ridge from there.\n\nContinue along the ridge through 4th and low 5th class terrain to the summit of stanley.\n\nDescend via NW ridge.\n\n\n\nApproach via the Stanley glacier trail. Past the tree island at the end of the regular trail continue up scree and ledges to the east tongue of the Stanley glacier.
