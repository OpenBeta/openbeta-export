FRA: Larry Stanier, Margie Smith, Mark Klassen, Tim Johnson","length":303,"content":{"description":"A fun route up a cool feature.  The climbing is mostly 5.5 and the 5.8 sections are short.  I would say that you do this route for the feature and the atmosphere not for the climbing. Be comfortable moving efficiently or the route will take longer than needed. Various pitches and scrambling sections can be combined.  It is a fun alpine day out with great views!\nNapsihu is \"Finger\" in the Stoney language.\n\nFA write up can be found here:\nhttps://www.tabvar.org/sites/default/files/The%20Finger%20Napsihu%20Ridge.pdf\n\nP1: 5.4, 15m  Climb the short wall to the left of 2 protections bolts.\n-At the top of this pitch walk through the trees until you reach a talus slope. Continue up staying tight to the wall on the left, progress is made up a grassy slope. When the wall on your left ends look for a scree ledge on your left with a cairn. Traverse this ledge and scramble up until you come to a short wall.  Pass the wall on the left (east) via a downward sloping ledge (bolt anchor). Scramble up another 30m until you reach the base of a steep wall and a 2 bolt anchor.\n\nP2: 5.8, 30m   Climb past bolts to a ledge. Traverse right on the ledge to a corner.  Climb the corner, then step left and climb slabs that lead to an overhang.  Bypass the overhang by stepping down and left through a few thin moves. Gain easy ground and continue up to the chains. Next pitch is located on the wall a few meters up and right of this anchor\n\nP3: 5.5, 20m  Look for a bolt to the right on the west face. Nice climbing leads to chain anchors above.  Belay here or move to anchor at the base of the chimney above.\n\nP4: 5.7, 20m  Climb the chimney and then to a bolt on the arête on the left. Slabby climbing leads to the anchors. Skip the chain anchor and belay at bolts a few meters past.\n\nP5: 5.6, 30m  Step down and move to the right onto the face.  Climb past bolts that lead to a corner on the right with chain anchor at the top.\nScramble the ridge above, go down a dip and up the other side.\n\nP6: 5.5, 20m  Climb through a dip and climb the slab to an anchor.\nScramble to the next step and belay\n\nP7: 5.8, 20m  Step down and left, then make a few moves up and left gaining a small ledge with a juggy wall above. Climb the jugs up and right to a crack. Use a .75 Camalot in the crack and continue up cracks to a ledge and anchor.  This is probably the best pitch with nice climbing and great position.\nMove right and scramble loose rock above to the next steep wall\n\nP8: 5.6, 20m  Step right and make steep moves to a bolt and continue to the anchors on a ledge\n\nP9: 5.8, 25m  Climb the cracks and steps above. Cams and bolts\n\nP10: 4th, 25m  Loose climbing leads to an anchor on the flat ridge\nScramble and belay at a notch\n\nP11: 5.5, 15m  Climb down the notch, step across and up the other side.\n\nP12: 5.4, 20m  Climb up past a bolt. You will come to an anchor that is used for descent of other routes, pass it and you will come to a newer chain anchor. Scramble a short distance to the summit.\n\nPark at the Sawback picnic area that is about 11km north of the south Bow Valley Parkway gates. At the back of the picnic area you will find a faint trail heading into the trees, after only a few meters another more faint trail branches off to the right, take that. From the picnic area you should be heading East and after a few minutes of bushwhacking you should encounter a large washout that turns into a mostly dry creek bed. Travel is fairly quick in the creekbed and after about an hour the creek will turn to the right (south). At this point keep an eye on the right (south) creek bank for blue and orange flagging tape and 2 large cairns. It is critical to find theses markers as the trail leaves the creek and heads up the slope through trees. Follow mostly blue flagging tape through the trees, it will eventually become clear that you are on a narrow spine of rock with steep gulleys on either side. This rock spine leads right to the start of the route at the base on a short rock wall and a single bolt anchor. 1.5-2hrs\nProtects mostly with bolts. You only need gear for a few sections (P7+9), Camalots .4-1 should do.  All anchors are bolted.
