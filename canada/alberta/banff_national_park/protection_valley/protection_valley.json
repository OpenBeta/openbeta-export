When snow height is down and access easier, it becomes a destination line in the valley.

Rock gear might be handy near the top of P1. \n  \n P1; Climb thin ice to a steep rock slot, then up the snow ledge to a fixed anchor (pins) on the right. Rock gear might be helpful if the ice is thin.  190' \n P2; Move left and climb thin ice that improves as you go, setting up a sheltered belay in an alcove.  130' \n P3; Climb as steep shield of ice off the belay, and continue up and left to a comfortable belay in a another alcove.  110' \n P4; Climb steep, continuous ice to v-threads just below the top. 170'\n\nThis route is located deep in Protection Valley, on the right side, behind Castle Mountain.
