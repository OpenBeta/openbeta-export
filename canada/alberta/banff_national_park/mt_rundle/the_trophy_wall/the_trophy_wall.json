(WI7+ R) When the sustained thin ice turns into thicker ice, expect to see difficulties in the WI5+/6 range.  \n  \n As much as I'd like to say I did it in WI7+ R condition, I didn't. I'll explain the climb in the conditions I found. \n  \n In 7+ condition Joe Josephson explains that the belay anchors are solid in the rock but besides that there is no gear leading, just sustained steep thin ice with a couple of overhangs.  \n  \n P1 Climb the WI5 Postcriptum Pillar for 40 meters until you arrive at the hanging bolt belay. (Only bolts on the climb) Continue to stare at the next pitch. \n  \n P2 Climb up to the top of the pillar and enter the \"Whipper Traverse.\" The pitons there are quite interesting. OR place a high screw and traverse directly right skipping the Whipper Traverse with a couple of M4/5 moves to Sea of Vapors. I did not do the Whipper Traverse and skirted right before it so I cannot speak for how hard it is. I have heard M6 or M7. Continue up funky vertical ice for a while until the ground eases in angle. (85 degrees) \n  \n P3 Continue up a fun pitch of exposed WI5 climbing until a belay can be made. If your lucky, there is sometimes a cave that makes one of the best belay stations I've been on.  \n  \n P4 Continue up vertical ice until the top of the climb is reached. \n\nThe route is the right most line on the Trophy Wall. The start is by the Postcriptum or a direct start can be had via two bolts at the roof but it's been known the crux hold broke making it extremely more difficult then it already was. <br />  <br /> Descend via V threads. <br />  <br /> Enjoy!\nIn the conditions I found, no rock gear was needed. A couple knifeblades are not a bad thing to bring though.

As with any ice route, conditions are widely variable from year to year, but it seems that Troubled Dreams, originally a mixed route, has been coming regularly over the past few years.  Difficult to say where the crux will be.  It could be pulling through the small roof on the first pitch or past the overhang at the start of pitch two.  Mostly the route is just steep and continuous.  \n  \n Scramble up to the base of the WI3 approach ice to a one-bolt belay, and continue to the base of the route. \n  \n Pitch 1, 60m:  Climb through several vertical steps to the base of a curtain or pillar(s) pouring over a small roof.  Climb over the roof and continue up steep ice to a belay on the left, under another overhang.   \n  \n Pitch 2, 60m.  From the belay, step right and climb vertical to slightly overhanging ice and continue up the steep headwall to a belay under a small overhang on the right. \n  \n Pitch 3, 25m.  Step left from the belay and climb a steep column, that may be slightly overhanging at the top.\n\nTroubled Dreams is in the center of The Trophy Wall.  The first pitch is about 10m right of The Replicant, and it joins that route for the final two pitches.  It is between The Sea of Vapours and The Terminator, the start will be obvious.  Descent is from v-thread anchors.\nScrews (med to long) protect the entire route.  Take extra screws for belays, which may or may not have in-situ v-threads.  Be sure to bring cord to create/backup anchors.

That is the Trophy Wall. \n  \n The Trophy Wall doesn't really need an introduction as it has become known with the sport of ice climbing. Climbing any of these routes is indeed a trophy. These routes are some of the most watched routes around. If any of them form, expect to see others from around the world trying to get on them. Also expect to experience some of the best ice climbing around along with a good challenge. And the exposure is simply amazing!  \n  \n The Terminator was the first climb on the wall to be climbed in 1985. It was graded WI7 and took three days to climb. Since then, it has been downgraded to WI6+. The few that have climbed it have said it's the hardest piece of ice they have ever climbed. It's the most watched piece of ice in Canada and has not formed that much. \n  \n Two other routes on the wall, The Replicant (WI6+) and Sea of Vapors, were also climbed in the early 1990's. \n  \n Sea of Vapors was originally graded WI7+ R and defined what was possible when it was done. One can only imagine how hard and physicological the leads were with extremely thin ice and overhung ice. That is with no protection except the belays.  \n  \n The Trophy Wall see's no sun at all. When one of the climbs are \"in\", expect to see traffic.
