It is remarkably consistent in its moderate grade.\n\nPitches:\n1. WI3/4, 40m. A short 85 degree step followed by a less steep bulge to bolted anchors.\n\n2. WI3/4, 55m. A short 85 degree step. Keep walking and climb the next WI3 step to more bolts.\n\n3. WI3/4. Climb a short step (this should be old news by now). Supposedly there are bolts, but we couldn't find them under the snow and ice.\n\n4. WI3. A short step.\n\n5. WI3. A couple of moderate steps lead to a tree anchor on the side, or screws/threads in the middle of the flow. It is possible to link 4 and 5 with 60m ropes.\n\n6. WI4, 30m. Bigger and more sustained than the previous pitches, this is the money. The left side involves 20m of 80-85 degree ice, while the right side is steep enough that a ballsy leader could easily pick a fat WI5 section.\n\nRappelling the route with one rope would be annoying, but possible. Two ropes would be preferable.  This entire route is an avalanche run-out.  Be aware of conditions and take appropriate precautions.\n\nScrews. <br /> V-threads for rappelling."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Rb7uPjiMWW+wClxQbsVXBQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.47034,51.12423]}},"createdBy":"4nbhMSf1UqWPGCD36J7raw==","_change":{"user":"4nbhMSf1UqWPGCD36J7raw==","historyId":"64133dcdf0cf0083295d3da8","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:03:25.360Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,799c5c9a-7c10-5124-bd2e-83ea47291e11,7149b703-9466-538f-aee2-047456a0a073,45beee3e-388c-596f-b00a-5c506ec55705","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Banff National Park","Mt.
