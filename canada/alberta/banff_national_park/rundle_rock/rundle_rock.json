It is a classic area that has been climbed on for over 50 years and so the holds are very polished, but it is great place to climb if you're in Banff and want to get on some rock. It is mainly an area for beginners and guiding services, and there are a few topropes available on the actual Rundle Rock Slab but also a ton of easy bouldering near the main slab from V0-V2 and a couple V4/5's."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"HHAVSDauVFqTyuqZaxvymw==","historyId":"64133e36f0cf0083295d4231","prevHistoryId":"64133e34f0cf0083295d4226","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:05:08.505Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:35.905Z","updatedBy":"HHAVSDauVFqTyuqZaxvymw=="}
