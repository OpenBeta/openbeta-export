Edith.  This classic line is hard to follow, wanders around to find all the weaknesses and has quite a sting in the tail for the second to last pitch. 15 meter run outs on 5.8/5.9 rock was encountered by us, questioning this Greenwood fella the whole fucking way!  No fall zone, no gear, no sticky rubber, 1961, what a MAN!  \n\nP1. Climb the obvious, large left facing corner (The Kaffir Strikes \nBack 5.10d) for 50 meters to a ledge that cuts across the face to the left.  This pitch does not go all the way to the piton anchor that is the top of the first pitch of the Kaffir.  Rather, set a belay at the ledge.  5.7\nP2. Traverse a full rope length on the ledge, staying relatively level with the belay.  Set a belay around the corner in shattered rock.  5.0\nP3. climb the easy ramping right facing corner, then traverse up and left on ramps and slab~esq climbing into another right facing corner. Belay on the ledge. 5.7 50 meters\nP4. Move left, ascend the slab and corner again, then onto broken terrain into what the guidebook called a chimney, and I will call a groove. Belay at the base of the groove. 5.6 50 meters\nP5. Short.  Climb up the grove, then left at the small roof, then up a corner again onto a flat ledge with a good belay.  5.7+ 25 meters\nP6. LEFT!  GO LEFT!  Right looks good, and easy up a slab into the roof, but the guidebook says left.  Traverse left here for 10 meters on good rock and then around the corner and then another 10 more meters into a good crack/corner and up to a belay 5-10 meters above the high roof.  We went right, up the slab into the roof, then traversed left.  The rock is climbable, but rotten below the roof and it was 5.9 climbing on very questionable rock with one fixed piece, I do not recommend. \nP7.  We did a ~25 meter traverse left here from the belay to escape crap rock above our heads.  5.7 climbing, zero meters elevation gain. \nP8. Climb the face above you to the left of the rotten crack/corner at 5.7/5.8 climbing with runout protection to a HUGE party ledge. 55 meters \nP9. Climb straight up over a bulge (5.7) onto another (much smaller) ledge where you have options....(Do not climb the rotten corner) A: climb the darker colored rock on the right that is compact, steeper, harder, better quality rock and no gear, or B: Climb the gray rock to the left that isn't as steep, you can be on your feet more, but the rock is very questionable and still has no gear!  to a ledge at the base of the right facing corner (large bedding plane)  55 meters 5.8/5.9 R/X\nP10. After you bring your heart rate back down and collect your thoughts, Climb the corner directly above the belay for 45 meters.  Move out right to the fixed pins to finish on a small, vertical headwall.  5.9 55 meters.  Belay at the col.\n\nTraverse from the Col, to the higher col to the west by either going down 50 meters, then take a right and go back up a gully, or just traverse on broken rock from the belay.  No rope was used here to get to the higher, west Col to start the raps back down to the west side of the North Face. \n\nWe were able to get down the \"west Couloir\" with one 60 meter rope finding 'ok' anchors for the first 4-5 raps, then we started down not being able to find them all.  We did a short rap on one fixed angle, and then another full rap on one #13 nut we fixed and then found anchors again.  Maybe you don't stay in the couloir the whole way? Maybe rap to skiers left where the couloir opens up?  Either way, I am not going back up anytime soon to find out!  Note:bring cord to leave at some anchors, feel free to bring a hammer and a pin collection with you to supplement or replace some anchors or just go for it like we did...\n\nTake the normal Mt. Louis approche from the Fireside parking area to the Valley of the Gargoyles that separates Edith from Louis.  Head up to Edith pass (but don't go there), take a left at the sign for Mt. Louis.  Stay on the the trail the whole way into the valley and you will see the obvious, left facing corners system that is The Kaffir Strikes Back. 2.5-3 hours from the car. <br /><br />Note: 3/4 the way up from the highway to the sign post for the left turn for Mt. Louis, their is a spring that feeds the creek just 3 meters off the trail.  It is a great place to fill up your bottles up or down from the climb.  \nVery little fixed gear is on this route, we maybe saw 4-5 old pitons of various quality, and I removed one by hand!  Bring a rack to a #3 (we used a #4 once or twice, but you could get away with out it) and doubles of # .4 to #2 and C3s down to a green.

After gaining the prominent ledge on the southeast side of the mountain, find the biggest right leaning gully that heads to the top.  Climb this gully (a few fixed pins and newer looking bolts 2006) for a few long pitches.  THis gully isn't very hard, and soloing would be the fastest way.  If your feeling a bit shaky, their is plenty of places for gear along the way.   \n Take this gully to the top of the south peak, from here traverse north on broken terrain and a few steep steps, also all very soloable.  Continue until the top is found along the wide ridge line.  To get back to the car, head south from the summit until the scramble route is found.
