The rock is highly water eroded, and fantastic. Route range from pure vertical dances to large roofs and burly boulder problems. The rock tends to be very sloppered with high friction and includes many sidepulls and gastons. Technical seems to always be the style of most cruxes and routes. Routes are not sustained, rather having one crux for the grade or a redpoint crux also. Onsighting tends to come easy on routes on black bullet rock, yet very hard to read on yellow or white rock. The crag offers great sun year round, especially on Punk Wall and Rainbow Wall. The crag boosts everything from 5.7 to 5.13b with the possibility of futurstic 5.14 lines at Rainbow- yet with alot of work. the crag has much more potential for being Banff's best all round crag. A list of very classic routes resides here including one of the valleys best technical power test pieces \"carnal prayer mat\" 12b, the perfect 10c \"Sister Ray\", the burly \"Out to lunch\" 13a/b. the technical 38m pumpfest of \"Power Of Dreams\" 11d, the cryptic very high quality \"Brain Dead\" 11c/d and the technical corner stemming masterpiece \"Vanilla GUERILLA\" 12a."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"vXuMx38TUWeE1uss4yN/Wg==","historyId":"64133cd6f0cf0083295d3640","prevHistoryId":"641339b2f0cf0083295d2a0a","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T15:45:14.529Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:44.259Z","updatedBy":"vXuMx38TUWeE1uss4yN/Wg=="}
