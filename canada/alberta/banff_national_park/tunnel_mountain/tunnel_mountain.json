The roof looks like an obvious feature to climb but upon closer inspection is sort of junky. At the roof, head left through crux moves using interesting blocky sidepulls and gastons. Follow a few more bolts to a semi-hanging stance at 30m. 13 bolts. \n  \n P2: 25m 5.8 Head left through some good rock and crux moves. At bolt 3 or 4 head straight up and contour slightly right to an anchor at a dirty ledge. 7 bolts.  \n  \n P3: 25m, 5.10c The crux pitch in my opinion felt soft for the grade. I'd say this clocks in at honest 5.10a but, none the less, is really, really good. Move left off the dirty ledge to some bolts. Keep going left until a smooth panel of good limestone is encountered. Balance your way up into a small, left-facing corner and continue climbing to a two bolt anchor. 9 bolts.  \n  \n P4: 25m, 5.10a Climb up the face using awesome finger locks and liebacks to reach a corner. Stem, smear and negotiate a roof full of loose blocks to reach... a dirty ledge and a two bolt anchor. 9 bolts.  \n  \n P5:25m, 5.10a A relatively good pitch up a good swath of clean rock. Same type of movement as all the other pitches with a slightly perplexing crux move around bolt 4 or 5. 8 bolts.  \n  \n P6: 30m, 5.9 The best pitch on the whole route! Climb up on awesome incut, chert features to a crux move heading right and bust through a roof to... a dirty ledge and the anchors. 11 bolts. \n  \n P7: 15m, 5.8 A0 Climb up through and around a low roof passing two bolts. Gain the \"bolt ladder\" (when we did our ascent there were weathered aiders in place) and make a long reach to the last bolt of the ladder and head left to the anchor. A cool pitch if you've never climbed a bolt ladder. 7 bolts. The anchor is around a tree that is seeing much wear, tear and erosion. It would probably be best if somebody placed another bolt next to the first bolt of the following pitch for a more sustainable (and less freaky) anchor for future ascents. I would have but didn't have a bolt kit with me. \n  \n P8: 20m 5.10a The sting in the tail. Negotiate some weird moves up to a weird crux but finish on some AMAZING chert features in a left-facing shallow corner. The chert looks like lichen but is in fact bullet proof crimping! \n  \n Make 8 30m Rappels or (better option) walk off to the west and contour back north towards your car.\n\nTo the right of many single pitch sport lines and to the left of a cave which is the home of a fixed rope dangling in space. Easy to find- look for the surprisingly low bolts of the 1st pitch.\n13 Quickdraws.

The route is often guide and can become crowded on the weekend.  Extreme care should be taken if a party is below you to avoid sending rocks down onto them! \n  \n Pitch 1: 30m, 5.4 Head up the path of least resistance at the GB carve marking the start of the climb. Follow the right for a short pitch clipping two bolts on the way up.  Nice ledge w/ 2 bolt belay just past a shrub.Pitch 2: 40m, 5.6, Up and left to circumvent the steep stuff. Aim for the right facing corner/crack that takes excellent pro and follow to the ledge with trees.  Good anchor on the wall left of the trees. Try to avoid putting more rope grooves into the tree.Pitch 3: 45m, 5.8 All bolts, no gear. Hard left traverse up the ramp and around the corner. Follow the line of bolts straight up the face on the left, which keep you out of the somewhat loose dihedral.  Somewhat improbable looking at first, but it is indeed 5.8 and the holds are bomber after a couple insecure moves with a bolt at your chest.Pitch 4: 25m, 5.6 head left up the weakness clipping fixed pins as you go.Pitch 5: 50m, 5.8 All bolts, no gear unless going hard right to the original gooseberry dihedral. Up and right being careful to mind the blocks, some of which would be really bad to pull off for the leader and belayer. Follow the bolts up the super solid face on classic incut edges. An excellent pitch with great position. Alternatively, keep following the ramp up from the belay and climb the left facing dihedral with trad gear.Pitch 6: 30m, 5.6 Left up the weakness. Good gear abounds, if somewhat finicky. This pitch is steep and no gimme for 5.7!Pitch 7: 30m, 5.7 original chimney finish (slick!). Go straight up the chimney clipping one bolt and either head up into the trees to belay or skirt left after the chimney for a 2 bolt chain anchor.Pitch 7 alternate: 5.7, head up the chimney clipping the bolt and continuing on several meters higher till you reach a prominent shelf on the left you can traverse hard left onto and over to reach a fixed pin.  Head up easier ground to the 2 bolt anchor on top. I haven't tried this, but it seems plausible and was on our topo.Pitch 7 alternate sport finish: Head up and clip the bolt in the chimney then traverse hard left onto the face and follow the bolts.  Felt hard 5.9 to me with delicate footwork and thin sidepulls, but all there and bolts where you need 'em. I'd recommend it.\n\nApproach: Head across the open field towards the cliff and locate the large manhole cover (sorta hidden behind bushes. Pick up the trail and follow it SW. At the first Y, take a right, then angle right at the second Y. At an intersection, keep heading straight for the cliff. When you reach the base skirt south (climbers left) along the base until you find an obvious beat down spot where the climb starts in a 5.6 groove. Most notable, there is a heart shape carved in the rock just right of the route and the route itself has \"GB\" carved at the start. Kinda lame, but it makes finding it easy. <br />  <br /> Descent: head uphill for a few meters from the topout and you'll cross the tourist trail, head right for about 5 minutes to reach the summit and stunning views (if so desired).

Just what you expect: some good climbing and some weird loose rock that is going to get better and better. Probably one of the better routes up on this little island in Banff City, maybe my favorite second to Tonka. A good short outing and a walk off make this a low commitment day in the Rockies. \n\nWhat to expect on this one: some loose rock, lots of technical slab and some roofs. Overall very interesting and quite good. Hopefully this gets better and better with age! \n\nFrom Chris Perry's PDF TOPO on TAVBAR:\n\nThis nine-pitch route is the result of the latest excavation/construction project on the East Face of Tunnel Mountain. The climb follows the obvious prow on that side of the mountain and has some excellent climbing on generally good rock. It is a sport route, completely equipped, and with a 30m rappel route. At least 15 QDs are required and some longer slings are useful. The route has been cleaned extensively but there seems to be an endless supply of loose rock, particularly at the ledges. Watch out for people below who may be traversing along the base towards the Gooseberry area (the lower trail is recommended). The climb itself follows a diagonal line and climbing parties lower down are not generally in the line of fire. The rappel route, however, is a different matter and a walk-off descent is strongly recommended.\n\nThe first two pitches are worth doing in their own right as a shorter climb. An easier two-pitch start (5.9) has been established to the left of the main route which avoids the difficult first pitch.\n\nThe general line was apparently attempted previously since rappel pitons were found at the fifth station and some fixed gear is evident in the broken corner system directly below (using\nthe same start as Hidden Crack and left of the current line). This probably dates from the early 70s when Lloyd MacKay and Don Vockeroth were exploring this section of the face.\nStart: Hike up towards The Scoop and when the trail reaches the cliff, continue left along the base instead of going right and up towards The Scoop. Go left past a small rib and the start is about 10 m further on, below a row of bolts leading up to a large, rounded band of overhangs.\n\n1. 30 m, 5.10d. (15 bolts) Climb up and left easily at first and then make a tricky move right past the third bolt to reach a good foot-ledge. Continue up to the roof and lean out on rounded holds at first and then using a good finger-crack to reach a big hold over the top and slightly to the left. Reach across to another good hold and pull up (crux) into a shallow scoop. Climb the steep wall above and go over the bulge on good holds into a small bay. Make a couple of moves up a small corner and then exit left onto the face (hidden bolt). Continue more easily up a shattered wall and onto slabs above. The station is at a grassy ledge a short distance higher.\n\n2. 30 m, 5.10a/b. (12 bolts) Move up to a small ledge just left of the tree and climb the slabby wall above on great rock, angling slightly left. Slightly harder climbing near the top leads to the station at a small ledge.\n\n3. 30 m, 5.7. (6 bolts) Step up left to a ledge below a short groove and climb the left arête on excellent holds to broken ground and a left-slanting corner. Climb the slab left of the corner past 3 three bolts to more broken ground and a bolt at a small step. Scramble up to a station at the next rock band.\n\n4. 20 m, 5.8+. (7 bolts) Move up to a small roof and undercling using the crack beneath it to reach good holds above. Continue up the slabby wall past a balancy section to a shallow corner which leads to the next station at a long ledge.\n\n5. 30 m, 5.10a. (13 bolts) Climb the steepening wall above on good holds at first and then with more difficulty higher up to reach a line of overhangs. Traverse left, staying low at first and then moving up to a key handhold 2ft right of a bolt. Pull up left to gain a ledge at the left end of the overhangs at the base of a long, right-facing corner. Climb the corner (loose higher up) to a station on the left where the wall steepens.\n\n6. 20 m, 5.10b. (6 bolts) Climb up and left from the belay and traverse around a small rib (bolt) into a bay below a rotten overhang. Move up past a bolt into a steep bridging position, reach up high on the left for a small, hidden slot, and then pull up using small incuts on each side of a bulging promontory to gain a good flat hold at its top. Climb up into the groove above and continue to a small, semi-hanging station on the left. A difficult pitch to enjoy.\n\n7. 30 m, 5.10a/b. (13 bolts) Follow the ramp above the belay on generally good holds, but with a few difficult sections, until forced out left and then up to a small “cave” below the final bulge. Move up left slightly and find a small layaway for the right hand, crank up to reach small chert edges above\n\n8. 30 m, 5.9. (12 bolts) Climb the slabby wall above on good sloping holds towards a large, undercut flake on the left. Move up past the right side of the flake and step left above it onto small ledges. Difficult moves on the right lead to easier ground and a series of short corners in the wall above. Stay left of blocks near the top to reach the station at a long, horizontal ledge.\n\n9. 15 m, 5.8. (5 bolts) Climb up into the corner above the belay and follow it past a bulge with interesting holds (fossilized sponges?) to a tree with a chain around it at the top.\n\nWhen you get to the fork to turn towards gooseberry / Tonka or ballista, take it towards Tonka. Then at the next fork hike up and right to the climb. Climb is scratched into the rock. \nBolts"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"4S4XB4K+XKKtpxrPBfCHog==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.5528,51.1775]}},"createdBy":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","_change":{"user":"3j2NvpbBUCyQgOUIxKpfgw==","historyId":"64133f23f0cf0083295d4a8f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:09:07.296Z"},{"_id":"h3rsRXMUSdeBuLjCOu+X9w==","name":"Rocket Surgery","grades":{"yds":"5.9"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"John Martin, 2007","length":15,"content":{"description":"\nGood route.

It hosts a bit of everything in the way of limestone: trad-y moves in a corner, easy face, hard face, easy slab, hard slab and a burly but juggy finish!  \n  \n Note: every set of pitches can be combined easily with long draws and a 70m rope. This is easily a 4 pitch route. \n  \n Pitch 1, 5.9 \n Start by getting to a low bolt with a pretty bad tumble fall potential. easy loose climbing goes up on good holds curving through natural features.  \n  \n Pitch 2, 5.10a \n Go up onto a tricky face and lay back a weird corner feature on good feet. Quite short, maybe 20m. Good rock and fun moves, but not very hard. \n  \n Pitch 3, 5.10b/c \n A really good pitch that has two things that are strange: first, not very difficult as it seems that the climbing is very sporty and juggy. This has said to be as high as 11a which i think is way off (no way is wicked gravity this easy!) That said, if you don't like climbing dynamically, this could easily be 10+ \n  \n the second thing is the obvious manufacturing of holds. I understand that this keeps the grade quite consistent but is always not the best in my view (especially when it seems like a bit more swerving could have created a good route that wasn't just straight up). But hey, that's how it is now and I had a good time (YMMV).  \n  \n Pitch 4, 5.10a \n Another fun pitch, much easier than the last and maybe the second easiest of the 10s. Quite loose. one fun bit of overhang gets you over to the anchors. \n  \n Pitch 5, 5.9  \n Now this one was tricky. Felt almost the same grade as the last but I am willing to admit, maybe less pumpy. A big broken corner and some tricky lay backing make this really a good time, yet, unsustained as the fun is quickly over.  \n  \n Pitch 6, 5.10+ \n I am not a slab climber. I do not climb well without something to sink a pad into. This climb really tests that and I thought this was the crux. You can easily get off route. The rock is featureless. Whoever thinks this is 10b is pretty good at slab. Traverse to the hanging belay. \n  \n Pitch 7, 5.8 \n It may look tricky but its mega jugs. The worst part is looking down at 200 ft of air to a ledge and then 500 ft to the dirt. But, again, very easy and juggy. Fun! \n  \n Pitch 8, 5.10b \n A money pitch in it's own right. This and pitch 3 were my favorites. Basically, just grab weird blocks (solid) up to the final anchor.
