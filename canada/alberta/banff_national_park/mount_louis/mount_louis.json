After a few meters, climb up a short right trending hand crack. After this crack, step left to another bolt to avoid the loose 4th class terrain out right. Find the next belay on the prominent ledge.\n\nPitch 2) 5.11+, 45m (14 bolts and 2 cams) 45m. Follow the line of bolts up and left for 45m of excellent climbing. At the small alcove after the last bolt, place the only gear required on the pitch (a 3-inch and a finger size piece), then move up and sightly left to the obvious end of the difficulties and the belay. Using longer slings on the mid-way traverse will help with rope drag. \n\n Pitch 3) 5.6, 30m.  This belay is exposed to rockfall from the low-angle terrain above, so take care. The next belay is directly above you. Climb up and slightly right and then abruptly left when level with the next belay. Not much gear in the pitch, but it is relatively easy climbing. \n\n Pitch 4) 5.11- 25m (4 bolts and gear up to 3 inches) There is a high first bolt directly above you; however, you want to access it from the ledge system out to your left. Once at this bolt, climb straight up (2 more bolts) following the right-facing corner above you. After the crux, you will need a crucial .75 cam (and a finger-size cam to back it up if you want), then continue to another bolt before the easier terrain. After the last bolt (4th), step right to wider cracks. Follow these cracks up left to the next belay ledge.\n\n Pitch 5) 5.12-, 45m, (10 bolts and gear up to .75) Another excellent and technical pitch. Head out left ( 3-4’ cam) for 5m, then steep back right onto the face and a bolt. Climb straight up to the base of the steep wall and then head left up cracks (finger size cams). A few meters before a sizeable right facing (loose looking) corner, step right onto the main face and follow bolts up the steep headwall. Midway up the wall, you will reach two flakes (crux), these flakes have been torqued on with a hammer, but it is still advisable to tread lightly on them. A medium-sized nut is useful just before the anchor. Longer draws are helpful early in this pitch. No stopper moves, but more sustained than pitch 2).\n\n Pitch 6) 5.9, 20m (1 bolt and gear to 4’). Step right up to a hidden bolt, then up to the right and the ridgeline. Once on the ridge, follow wider cracks up left to the next belay.\n\n Pitch 7) 5.7, 32m (1 bolt and gear to 1’). Climb up to the top of the pinnacle above you (easy), then step down a few meters to the left, and then traverse left (bolt) to the main ledge below the Diamond and the next belay.\n\n Pitch 8) Two options:\n5.10- 40m (6 bolts and gear to 4’) Head straight up towards the main off-width and the first bolt. After 3 bolts, follow broken cracks a few meters right of the off-width to a small stance. From this stance (where option B intersects), continue climbing the face cracks to the right of the off-width through a small roof. Continue up to the next bolts and then climb the off-width up to the next ledge and belay.5.10- 40m (4 bolts, 1 pin, and gear to 4’). From the belay below the Diamond, step down past option 1) to the base of a steep hand crack. Follow this crack until it ends, clip a pin, then a bolt, then follow a seam back across to the right and into the main off-width mid-way up option 1). Follow option 1) to the next belay. \n Pitch 9) 5.11- 32m (Gear to 4’, small nuts beneficial at the crux) Climb the prominent cracks out left from the belay. After a ledge, climb steeply up a thin cruxy dihedral; small nuts are very useful in this section.  \n\n Pitch 10) 5.10-, 32m (gear to 4’) Continue following cracks to the left of the main ridgeline. Near the top, continue up the steep off-width corner that protects with some hidden cams and 2 bolts. When you get to the exposed stance above, step right onto the main ridgeline and a bolt. Continue to the top of the Diamond! It is possible to avoid the off-width section by stepping right onto the main ridge and following looser rock to the top.\n\nSummit: From the top of the Diamond, it is possible to rappel into the gulley between the Diamond and Mount Louis and then continue up the route 'The Shining' to the top of mount Louis. The Shining's last two pitches are 5.11d and 5.10c. \n\nDescent(s): \n\n If on the top of Mount Louis: rappel the standard descent route\n\n If on the Diamond: Rappel back down 'Diamonds are forever'; however, you will have to reverse the traverse of pitch 7). At the top of pitch 2, rappel straight down (36m) and find a hidden anchor on the ledge equal to the top of pitch 1). From here, rappel either 30m to some 4th class terrain or 60m to easier terrain. All (rap) anchors are currently set up with 1 carabiner attached by cord to the two anchor bolts.   \n\n\n\nApproach as per ‘Homage to the spider”. When you are at the highest part of the 4th class terrain on the approach (just before heading down to the start of Homage), look up to the absolute highest point, where you will find 2 belay bolts and the beginning of the first pitch. 2-3 hrs from the car.\n\n \n\n\nGear: 10 quickdraws, 4 shoulder slings, a single rack of cams from from.3 to #4 (Double from .3 to #2 depending on your comfort). Small to mid-sized nuts. All belays are bolted. Two ropes if you plan to rappel the route.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"FkAaqpJdXHyGPgsgUamF0A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.68002,51.21545]}},"createdBy":"7WPJ+Ce3UoCE+m2mD6kL2w==","_change":{"user":"7WPJ+Ce3UoCE+m2mD6kL2w==","historyId":"64133d7cf0cf0083295d3add","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:02:04.378Z"},{"_id":"L1ANTCz3Q9OyuhIXK/pH+w==","name":"The Gargoyle","grades":{"yds":"5.10a"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Brandon Pullan, Will Meinen 2008","length":606,"content":{"description":"\nGargoyle adds seven pitches of climbing on sound stone.

Many of the belays are bolted, yet despite this the route is time consuming and the route finding can be challenging. Start early, and bring a headlamp. The large number of bivy sites on the upper portion of the route and on the summit are a testament to the number of climbers that either underestimated the route or ran into trouble.\n\nNote that  on the upper pitches I found the route finding to be tricky and some of the belays were difficult for me to locate. As a general rule, consider that the rock was quite good for Canadian Rockies limestone, and so if you end up on anything particularly loose you may be off route.\n\nWhen viewed from the approach trail, the southeast face is the one that is immediately visible. The Gmoser route climbs the lower slabs to a prominent corner, and then joins in with the Kain route for its upper pitches. \n  \n                        Mt Louis from the approach trail.        \n  \n From the scree below Mount Edith, cross the boulder field and follow a faint trail up to the base of the south face of Mount Louis. Two short corners are visible at the bottom of the face. The leftmost one has an inviting crack, but the right one is the one you are looking for. A single bolt marks the beginning of the route. To help locate the start, make a note of the crux corner of pitch five. The start is roughly straight below this. \n  \n                        Mt Louis topo       \n  \n The trend for the first four pitches is to climb roughly straight up to the pitch 5 corner\n\nP1: 60m, 5.7  Climb the corner than follow the slab straight up past an anchor to a two bolt belay at 60m. This pitch is quite runout, with some enjoyable face/slab climbing near the top. \n  \n                        Looking down from the pitch 1 belay. This is typical terrain on the first few pitches       \n  \n P2: 55m, 5.5  From the belay climb left to a rib. Follow the rib to a two bolt anchor. \n  \n                        Typical of the bolted anchors on the Gmoser route. I found them sometimes difficult to locate in a sea of similar coloured limestone.       \n  \n P3: 60m, 5.5  Climb up an easy gully then step right to belay at two bolts on a small ledge.\n\nP4: 45m, 5.6  Climb up and right below an overhang then up through a short steep section to a belay at two bolts on a small ledge at the base of the obvious corner.\n\nP5: 50m, 5.9  Stem up the corner past 2-3 pitons to near its top, then move left past another piton to a two bolt anchor. Though this pitch is the crux of the route at 5.9, it is on good rock and is extremely well protected in its entirety.\n\nThe trend for pitches 6 through 9 is to climb up and left to reach the right to left traverse of the Kain route.\n\nP6: 60m, 5.6  Climb up an easy low angled section to a gully. An awkward move over a bulge leads to a two bolt anchor on the right wall of the gully.\n\nP7: 40m, 5.6  Move left and climb the rib, runout at first, then left to a bolted anchor.\n\nP8: 40m, 5.6  Climb left across a gully, then up to a two bolt anchor.\n\nP9: 60m, 5.6  Continue up for 15m or so to reach a ledge system. From here the Gmoser route joins the Kain route. For those familiar with the Kain route, the point on that route where they join is at the right to left traverse after the rappel. Traverse left to a two bolt anchor.\n\nFrom here the trend is to climb up and left to reach a rib that marks the right edge of a giant gully system. This rib is then followed straight up to the summit. The correct route has good rock and some light polish on some of the holds, presumably from years of traffic on the Kain and Gmoser routes.\n\nP10: 55m, 5.5  Climb up then left across a gully, then up to a two bolt anchor.\n\nP11: 50m, 5.6  Again climb up and left to a short steep wall with a nice crack.  Climb this wall, then continue to an anchor with a single bolt.\n\nP12: 60m, 5.5  Climb up along the rib past two short steep sections to a gear anchor. Alternatively simul-climb to the base of pitch 14.\n\nP13: 60m, 5.0  Scramble up an easy low angled section towards a large chimney.

Follow this to the ridge crest.\n\nFollow the ridge crest, easy but exposed, to the summit cross.\n\nI carried a set of nuts and a single rack of cams from Black Diamond #0.1 to #3 with an extra #0.75, and I seemed to always have the piece that I needed. The pitch 5 corner and the Perren crack have a lot of fixed pieces and will eat gear, and so I suggest bringing a large number of draws.  <br />  <br /> As with any mountain route I would recommend double ropes and extendable draws. Leave the short draws at home. <br />  <br /> Experienced parties may wish to simulclimb some of the route on a short rope to speed things up.  <br />  <br /> Bring a headlamp and some extra clothing. <br />  <br /> It's reasonable to do the descent in rock shoes."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"FkAaqpJdXHyGPgsgUamF0A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.68002,51.21545]}},"createdBy":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ==","_change":{"user":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ==","historyId":"64133d7ff0cf0083295d3af4","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:02:07.051Z"},{"_id":"rdIYwn8GTZW5gt0lZNZzLQ==","name":"The Holeczi/Slawinski","grades":{"yds":"5.11-"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Raphael Slawinski and Steve Holeczi in 2014","length":242,"content":{"description":"\nIt adds six pitches to the left of Homage up a steep corner.

As a general rule, consider that the rock was quite good for Canadian Rockies limestone, and so if you end up on anything particularly loose you may be off route.\n\nWhen viewed from the approach trail, the southeast face is the one that is immediately visible, with prominent slabs at its base. The northeast face forms the right side of Mount Louis, and the east ridge splits the two faces. The Kain route climbs the northeast face to the east ridge. A rappel provides access to the southeast face which is followed to the summit. The pitches on the southeast face are shared with the Gmoser route.\n\nFrom the scree below Mount Edith, cross the boulder field and follow a faint trail up to the base of the south face of Mount Louis. Rope up near here rather than at the base of the climb, as the descent does not go back to the base. Locate a trail that traverses below Mount Louis and follow it to the right. This trail traverses below the east ridge. At a fork, stay left for the Kain route and climb up to the base of the cliff. The right fork continues further to reach the route Homage to the Spider. To help locate the start of the Kain route, there are three scoops low on the northeast face. The Kain route begins roughly below the rightmost scoop and then climbs up and left through the middle scoop.\n\nMost of the route is fourth class to easy fifth, with a few very short sections of 5.5 or 5.6.

Climbers today who struggle to complete the Kain route before darkness befalls them will likely not be comforted that Kain and MacCarthy did the first ascent in just four hours, using hobnailed boots, hemp ropes, and of course no gear as it had not been invented yet. To descend they down-climbed the route. \n  \n The list of famous names who have done first ascents on Mount Louis is extensive. Others beside Kain include Walter Perren, Hans Gmoser, Galen Rowell, Tim Auger, Layton Kor, Brian Greenwood, Sean Dougherty, Steve Demaio, Raphael Slawinski, and most recently Sonnie Trotter and Tommy Caldwell.  \n  \n Though there are many routes on Mount Louis, most of the climbing activity is concentrated on three routes in particular: the Kain route, the Gmoser route, and Homage to the Spider.  \n  \n                        Mt.
