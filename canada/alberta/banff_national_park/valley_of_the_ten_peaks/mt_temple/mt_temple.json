Achieving the ideal mix between difficulty and safety, the route offers a mellow approach, consistently excellent &amp; sustained climbing, magnificent views, relatively bomber rock and a carefree descent.  While the length and intricacy of the ridge and ensuing traverse of the peak ensure a long day, thankfully most of that day is spent climbing.  The route begins with many enjoyable pitches of steep rock climbing on good quartzite, then passes a brief shale band before eventually entering the dramatic sculpted limestone landscape of the Black Towers.  The final transition to the corniced summit ridge of the North Face Glacier is quite literally and figuratively the icing on the cake; not nearly as treacherous as some, but just enough to keep the long haul interesting. \n  \n While by today's standards this is a trade route, the climb should not be under-estimated.  After repeating this route in the late '70's, famed North American climbing historian Chris Jones famously remarked about the era, \"Never underestimate a route done in the 1930s; mountaineers back then were often fast and competent.\"  There is plenty of loose rock around, pro is tricky to place and the corniced ridge can be unstable on warm days.\n\nPark at a pullout a mile or two below the Moraine Lake Parking Area, along Moraine Lake Road.  Follow a trail up the grassy hillside on the North side of the road towards the base of the ridge.\nFollow the grassy hillside toward the base of the East Ridge.  Eventually vegetation gives way to talus, which is followed to the base of a third class ridge.  Follow the path of least resistance for several hundred feet of moderate scramble to a broad shoulder at the base of The Big Step. <br />  <br />               <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106997663\"></a><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106997663\"></a><a href=\"https://mountainproject.com/assets/photos/climb/106997663_medium_1494378135.jpg?cache=1511080769\"></a>         <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106997663\"><em>East Ridge Topo.</em></a>       <br />  <br /> Start a few feet left of the left nose of the buttress, and follow two or three pitches of steep 5.6 climbing on generally excellent rock to the top of the Big Step.  More moderate scrambling works up the ridge to another low angle section.   <br />  <br /> Hike easily along the ridge, mindful of loose rock, until the dark gray bands of the Black Towers are reached.  At this point locate a prominent ledge system and traverse left several hundred feet, eventually wroking up &amp; left to the next higher ledge system, and traversing another several hundred feet (snow may be encountered depending on conditions).  Continue the west-ward traverse until below a pair of similar-sized, conical towers.   <br />  <br /> A gully splits these towers, and another gully goes around the right-most tower on the right side.  Follow this, right-most gully for a couple pitches on relatively solid limestone at low 5th class to regain the crest of the ridge.

Retreat from high on the route would be difficult. \n  \n The Greenwood-Jones roughly follows a vague buttress that delineates the north and Sphinx faces, with variable rock quality. Primarily a rock climb, the route is best climbed in dry conditions, typically in late July and early August. The first ascensionists graded it 5.8 A1, the aid portion being a tension traverse on the penultimate pitch.  \n  \n Approach \n Hike to Lake Annette through the Paradise Valley. Contour around the right side of the lake and up towards the toe of the buttress.  \n  \n The Route \n A short cliff band guards the face. Locate a break in the cliffband and climb a short pitch of low fifth class which leads to easy terrain. Scramble up and right on generally good quartzite, which gets steeper as you go higher. Many pitches, mostly low to mid fifth class, lead to a horizontal ledge system at about three quarters of the height of the face. Parties should simulclimb as much of this as possible in order to avoid a bivy.  \n  \n Traverse left here for about a rope length, then follow a loose gully up and back to the buttress. A long pitch leads to a belay at the base of an alcove. From here climb up and left around a roof to a hand crack. Follow the crack to a belay about 20m short of large overhangs that block the way.  The next pitch is the crux and traverses right to avoid the  overhangs, then climbs up past three old pitons. The first ascensionists used aid at the beginning of this pitch for the initial traverse. A final pitch on solid limestone gains the top of the buttress.  \n  \n From here, slog up on loose scree to the left of the glacier towards the crest of the ridge. This is where the East Ridge route comes up above the Black Towers. Follow the corniced summit ridge to the top, and descend via the easy south west slopes to Moraine Lake. Assuming you parked at the Lake Annette trailhead, a long walk on the Moraine Lake road brings you back to your car.  \n  \n Beta \n We roped up for the inital short pitch at the beginning of the route, then soloed until it got uncomfortably steep. From here we simulclimbed a long way, until we got scared and began pitching it out. In the end we climbed ten long pitches from this point.  \n  \n Most of the route is mid fifth class but there was a bit of 5.9+ or 5.10 on the upper pitches. The rock quality varied from good to awful, and finding solid belay anchors was at times problematic. As is typical in the Canadian Rockies, protection was at times marginal and/or sparce. I took a huge whipper on the crux pitch when a hold broke and a piton pulled.  \n  \n At the leftward traverse, I'm pretty sure we didn't go far enough. I think we went about 30m then climbed up and right on solid rock back to the crest. The pitch we climbed after this was horrible. There was a marginal piton about 6m up, but then no gear that would hold a fall until 30m. And the climbing was fairly difficult on steep and loose rock. In hindsight I believe we should have gone much farther left before climbing back up to rejoin the buttress higher up. In the route description above I tried to describe what I believe to be the correct route \n  \n In terms of time, we left the car at about 4:30AM and reached the top of the buttress at around 6:30PM. I imagine this is reasonably quick as we did a lot of simulclimbing, although I'm sure fast parties could do much better. We made the mistake of not bringing crampons, thinking for some reason that the summit glacier would be snow covered, and as such we though that ice axes would be sufficient. They weren't.  \n  \n We ended up downclimbing the east ridge, with an unplanned bivy above the Big Step, and made it out the next morning. It was a bit of an epic day, but an awesome one.  \n  \n I highly recommend the route, but don't forget the crampons.\n\nExpect to find a few pitons here and there, but otherwise there is little fixed gear. I would recommend double ropes and a standard rack of nuts and cams to 3 inches, as well as a few pitons. An ice axe and crampons are needed for the summit ridge. I imagine most people would want rock shoes."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"hJcmS49XUICoIGrebCT29w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.2058,51.3512]}},"createdBy":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ==","_change":{"user":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ==","historyId":"64133f50f0cf0083295d4bf5","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:09:52.121Z"},{"_id":"RRj75N3YTv2/dsi/cY82AA==","name":"Greenwood-Locke","grades":{"yds":"5.8"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":true,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":true,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Brian Greenwood, Charlie Locke, July 1966","length":1364,"content":{"description":"This legendary alpine route was the first line climbed to the top of Temple's dramatic 4500' North Face. As perhaps the first great Canadian North Wall to be climbed, the first ascent ushered in the beginning of a new age of conquest in the Canadian Rockies. Although a notch shy of the mythic \"5.9 A2\" grade, this is a test-piece route that should be on every aspiring alpinist's must-do list. While in good, dry conditions this route is fairly routinely freed using mixed techniques, the face is still an intimidating prospect considering its massive size, loose rock, and commitment. Perhaps to emphasize its still-serious nature, the route has recently re-surfaced as the site of a somewhat notorious accident the impressive height of the wall, the relatively pedestrian approach &amp; trivial descent make one-day ascents quite possible for quick parties. Winter ascents are still rare and an impressive challenge. Conditions on the face tend to peak from late July to early August. Like most alpine ventures, there is a trade-off between dry conditions, which allow quick travel on the solid rock sections, and snowier conditions which cover the two chossy ledge traverses in relatively safe snow.The Parks Canada regularly restricts foot-traffic along the approach route to Lake Annette depending on Grizzly Bear activity in the area.\n\nMost parties will benefit from some type of shuttle/drop-off or hitch hike arrangement, as the most expedient approach is through Paradise Valley to Lake Annette, and the quickest descent is down the SW ridge to Moraine Lake.  Its physically possible to bivy at Lake Annette, but I can't begin to fathom the bureaucratic hoops one would have to jump through to arrange such a thing.\nFrom the lake, head south to the right tail-fin of the prominent \"Dolphin\" snowfield.  The left fin is also climb-able but more exposed.  Follow the ever-steepening snowfield/couloir to the rear-end of the Dolphin's dorsal fin.  Make a sketchy traverse up &amp; right to another ice/snowfield below steepening rock.  This traverse can be treacherous in lean snow conditions, exposing rotten unprotectable choss. <br />  <br />               <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106997622\"></a><a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106997622\"></a><a href=\"https://mountainproject.com/assets/photos/climb/106997622_medium_1494378134.jpg?cache=1658372636\"></a>         <a href=\"https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/106997622\"><em>Topo of the Greenwood-Locke.</em></a>       <br />  <br /> If not roped up yet, now is the time.  Locate a massive chimney/gully that is often running with water on warm days.  As Dr. Hemlock might say, \"Looks like we have some wet work ahead of us\".  (Depending on where you gained the upper snowfield, you may need to downclimb around a buttress to the right a ways to locate this chimney.)  Work up a steep section of relatively solid rock to reach tiered slabs of dark gray stone.  Move up and generally right (as needed to find dry rock), then back left along these slabs to reach the prominent (often snow-covered) sloping ledge that runs across the entire face. <br />  <br /> Traverse the chossy ledge for ~ 200 feet to reach the base of a prominent pillar.  This pillar can be easily spotted from the highway when the light is right.  Ascend the right side of the pillar on generally improving rock.  Follow your nose along this rib for several pitches, veering from side to side as conditions dictate.  The climbing is generally in the 5.6 range, with many ledges &amp; short dihedrals.  As the wall steepens, move to the left side of the pillar, and climb a long, difficult slab to regain the prow at an exposed ledge.  The crux pitch follows, beginning with a short traverse right, then entering a steep corner, ultimately gaining the top of the rib.  Fun climbing along a brief ridge of bulbous towers, passing a good bivy site, leads to the final headwall. <br />  <br /> The \"Ice Hose\" pitch climbs a steep, left-facing corner of solid limestone in dry conditions, but is often wet or icy.  The next pitch continues up a shallow corner to reach a good ledge.  One or two more pitches of steep chimneys &amp; cracks through shattered rock arrive at a broad loose ledge, nearing the looming headwall.  Traverse this ledge, then move up another 30 feet or so to the highest ledge, Temple's own \"Thank God Ledge\", providing escape from what is clearly an impregnable headwall.  There is a catch, and that is the gaping, choss-filled gully that has eroded its way straight through this ledge.  Traverse the ledge straight right, down climb to the bottom of the chossy gully, cross to the other side, and climb up teetering dinner plates with no pro to the continuation of the ledge.  From here it may be possible to simply continue traversing right along the ledge system.  Otherwise, climb straight up from the highest part of the left side of the ledge, on relatively solid, slabby rock. \nAlpine Kit, rock shoes, rock pro.  Ice/snow pro optional (condition dependent).\nFollow the throngs of hikers on the SW Ridge down to Moraine Lake."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"hJcmS49XUICoIGrebCT29w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.2058,51.3512]}},"createdBy":"jqSlzj+yWNKSCDmUw48jlQ==","_change":{"user":"jqSlzj+yWNKSCDmUw48jlQ==","historyId":"64133f51f0cf0083295d4bff","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:09:53.195Z"},{"_id":"EbhjAEP8RUW5L6pn7mj+BQ==","name":"Squashed Bones","grades":{"yds":"5.8"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Josh Briggs & Rob Owens Aug. 2001","length":1091,"content":{"description":"The NE buttress of Mt.

None of these are particularly secure, though by Canadian Rockies standards, the classic routes tend to be relatively solid.
