Aug. 1983","length":788,"content":{"description":"This long, Flying buttress of rock in the sky, separated from the main body of the mountain by the North Glacier, is composed of quartzite, limestone and dolomite, all with varying degrees of rock quality. The buttress is easy to find from any angle while in the valley, and is one of the most striking, obvious lines to climb in the region as well. \n\n-Start far left of the North Glacier on a small tongue of snow that usually lasts all summer long. From the right side of the tongue, climb up two pitches (wet, scree covered ledges) of quartzite to gain the ledges above.  ~90 meters total.\n-Scramble up a few rope lengths of scree and ledges up a right trending ramp to the headwall above.\n-Traverse left (south) along the base of the headwall until an extremely loose limestone chimney is found.  Climb for one long pitch, breaking out right before the final large chockstone.  Belayer take cover around the corner!\n-Scramble up and right to the base of the main flying buttress to the top of the large ledges that make up the lower black tower. ~5 pitches\n-Climb one more rope length to below a quartzite headwall on the ridge.  Note, you may find perfect quartz crystals at this belay. Super cool!\n-Climb two pitches, both with a 5.7 crux on good quartzite along the ridge. First is a crack/chimney above a block on right, the second is a corner pitch on dark colored rock.\n-One more scrambling pitch? brings you to the crux of the route, a \"5.7\" squeeze chimney on \"ok\" rock.  \n-Climb the chimney (crux) and set a belay on top. 30-40 meters. Rated 5.7, I believe it is only slightly sandbaged, and a bit runout.  Heads up climbing, but it is all there and be careful pulling the lip, as the rocks are all loose on the ledge.\n-(Memory not 100% here)Climb one or two pitches of loose, limestone with hard to find gear, but the climbing is easier.\n-Climb a section of gray colored rock, where the bedding plans all dip towards you, thus finding good edges is not possible at first.  Clip a fixed pin (only fix gear on the route) and continue up a crack/grove at protectable (but slightly loose) 5.8 climbing.\n-Climb another 100-150 meters of scrambling low 5th class with the occasional 5.5 move right of the ridge line.\n-Continue up and then back onto the ridge proper (bivy spots possible here) and belay in front of a broken headwall.\n-Traverse right (25-30 Meters)into a slot (possible snow) and then head up again on broken terrain 5.5-5.7 moves.  \n-Climb the remaining 100-200 meters of the ridge to gain the mountain proper. \n\nDown:\nThree possible ways\n1. Traverse around the backside of Tuzo and Allen and to descend the Schiesser Route back to Moraine Lake.\n2. Head down the backside glacier and weave your way down around the cliff bands to the lake (Kaufmann?) below on the backside and out the Tokumn Creek \"Trail\" Note:  This is LONG (20-25km) and the trail is not maintained the whole way.\n3. Summit Deltaform and then reverse the NW ridge route to the summit of Neptuak Peak and then down the NW ridge to the pass below. Fixed 30 meter raps and lots of exposed downclimbing the whole way. \n\nWe did option three for a 19.5 hour day.\n\nStarting from almost the center of the face of Deltaform Mountain, the buttress starts just left of the North Glacier.  Do not start near the glacier, but rather much further left (south) around the lower black buttress (that you do not actually climb on, complete crap rock) and start on orange colored quartzite in a corner above a snow apron.\nStandard Rockies Trad rack plus one or two KBs.  Crampons and a tool depending on time of year, decent options, ect.  They are not needed for the route though. "},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"l9P96cOXX2WR2t2Wl7QCCg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.24549,51.30193]}},"createdBy":"kaHRiOFoVeehp7TBDmpnzQ==","_change":{"user":"kaHRiOFoVeehp7TBDmpnzQ==","historyId":"64133f47f0cf0083295d4bbc","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:09:43.612Z"},{"_id":"1XHI70EnRQ6ntcZcTZvW/Q==","name":"North West Ridge","grades":{"yds":"5.5"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Greenwood Boles 1961","length":1515,"content":{"description":"I saw this route from the top of Temple and it screamed 'climb me!' That and the reputation for some crap rock caught my attention, gotta see what purported choss is really like...famous last words. \n This is a great mountain route, not overly-intricate route finding (just stay on the ridge!) lots of technical downclimbing and some heart swallowing exposure from time to time.  The final notch in 'n' out then in 'n' out feels way out there.   \n From Wenkchemna Pass one can either tackle the ridge directly via broken ledges and jugs to an easy chimney or said one may move across snow to the left, then steeply up and right to gain the ridge where the direct method meets up where the ridge is quite low angled.   \n I recommend simply following the ridge from here (the north face is steep and terrifying to look down), encountering some more technical climbing but it's more fun than the slate and shale 3rd class junk you can slog up further right (west).  Enjoy summit, number one. \n Downclimbing towards the col between Neptuak and Deltaform is involved, selective rappeling will certainly make it easier for some, but is not necessary.  I thought this bit had some of the worst rock. \n The col holds some very posh overnight accommodations (can be windy).  When it begins to steepen again, stick to the ridge line (redundant?).  Further along, conditions may force you right into a steep gully/recess which can be snow/ice filled, be prepared.   \n The final \"boulder problem\" is the notch- the summit's oh so close!  Full of rime and steep on all sides, things suddenly feel serious.  The climb out to the summit yields to balance and proper route finding, which feels easier when reversed.   \n Descend by returning from whence you came.\n\nIf you have to be told, then bring more.  I would say that most will enjoy having a single 60m rope.  There's a lot of tat up there already, can't say it needs any more."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"l9P96cOXX2WR2t2Wl7QCCg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.24549,51.30193]}},"createdBy":"QLA/jokcWs64MWG2ctKC9A==","_change":{"user":"QLA/jokcWs64MWG2ctKC9A==","historyId":"64133f48f0cf0083295d4bc6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:09:44.415Z"},{"_id":"dB+cux32TGqmaQkPReWavQ==","name":"Super Couloir","grades":{"yds":"5.8"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Chris Jones and George Lowe, July 1973","content":{"description":"This is an infamous and aesthetic climb.
