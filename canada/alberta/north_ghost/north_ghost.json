At some time, put on your crampons to assist with the approach and continue to the base of the first short step.  \n  \n 1st Pitch/60m- I combined what many would consider two pitches but is easily done as one. Climb the first step (WI 3) left of center and walk to the base of the real falls. This is a WI 4 30m beauty. The left side was better ice but less steeply angled than the right. The right side was more challenging, but was quite wet and chandeliery. I started right, but soon, detoured left and then back to the center towards the end of this pitch. There is a chain anchor on the right as you top out. This can be a very cold belay, so make sure to pack your down on lead. Also beware of falling rock whose fall line appears to be the left side, another reason for taking the more challenging line to the right if the ice is in better shape. \n  \n Middle Pitches- The middle ground involves quite a bit of hiking on ice. You will run into two falls worth pitching out, but could be soloed as well. Neither are above WI 3.  \n  \n Last Two Pitches/60m and 25m- Eventually you come to a short waterfall step ahead and to the right as the canyon narrows (two odd bird nests in the canyon wall on your right- photos). To your left is a 60m tall waterfall of WI 4 broken up by a few steps. The steepest section is the first 20 meters or so. You more than likely will be angling back left until you reach the first break. Then approach the 2nd section head on and the final piece angles back left again, until you top out to a broad bench with trees to your left for the belay. Beware that this pitch can cause considerable ice fall on your belay below which is located in confined quarters.  \n  \n The final shorter curtain can be WI 5 if you take the right side, but can also be quite wet and chandeliery.

An official government ban on crossing this river is in effect currently (2007) and appears to be an issue at large. Look for signage to that effect. It is regarding trout migration. Whether on foot or vehicle, cross the river and turn left heading west following the river. At a forced second crossing (cliff) is GBU (the Good, the Bad, the Ugly), a significant ice wall leading down to the river bed on the right. Continue past GBU along the river via a road on the left side until even with the next valley running north which is Valley of the Birds. Continue west on a road that sometimes is easy to follow and other times looks like a rubble of rocks. You will pass Burning in Water, Drowning by Flame, WI 6+ and the Sliver, WI 6 high up on your left.

Continue up the overhanging wall to a station on the right.  This pitch is a bit harder if ice fills the crack you follow. \n  \n P5, M7+, 30m.

It would make little sense to climb Devil’s Punchbowl without completing Beowulf which is a longer and more interesting objective. The first four pitches of Beowulf are required to even get to the start of the approach for Devil’s Punchbowl. These options are all single pitch.  \n  \n 1st Pitch/60m- Many climb this section as two pitches, but it is easily done as one.

Neither are above WI 3.  \n  \n Devil’s Punchbowl/40m- Eventually you come to a short waterfall step ahead and to the right as the canyon narrows (two odd bird nests in the canyon wall on your right- photos on Beowulf’s page). To your left is a 60m tall waterfall of WI 4 broken up by a few steps. This is the finish of Beowulf. Continue beyond this ice up the short step to the right and trudge up canyon for approximately 20-30 minutes until the canyon walls give way to a broad open fork. Take the left fork and hike 10 minutes through possibly deep snow to two perpendicular ice curtains. The curtain on the left is WI 2 and the one on the right is more WI 4. I chose a decent line up the mid section of the right curtain at WI 4. It is separated by one rest and then nice and steep for the finish. Once you crest the curtain, the ice can be somewhat questionable.\n\nWhen arriving at the base of the final two pitches to Beowulf, there is a small vertical ice step to ascend and then a trudge up canyon for 20-30 minutes until it opens completely up.

Two perpendicular curtains offer easy WI 2 ice to the left and WI 4 ice to the right.  <br />   <br /> Unlike Valley of the Birds and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (GBU), Beowulf, and even more to such extent Devil’s Punchbowl, see considerably less traffic.

Due to protected trout populations, the provincial government has limited access beyond the first river crossing which makes for quite the long day including a long hike in, long climb, descent and long hike out.

Its mountains include Mounts Aylmer, Apparition, Oliver and Costigan.   The Ghost Valley actually refers to a larger area that is more specifically located approximately 30kms north of Canmore along the eastern border of Banff National Park and east of the Palliser Mountain Range.    The Ghosts glacier carved valleys provide for steep water runoff creating some of the best waterfall ice climbing in Canada.   Much of this terrain is considered less avalanche prone than most ice routes in Kananaskis and routes deeper into the national parks.   Although not all the Ghost climbs are technically in The Ghost (many of the climbs are in Banff National Park), this whole area of provincial wilderness takes on that identity. \n  \n The Ghost Valley is discussed as the South Ghost and North Ghost relative to climbing. The South Ghost is divided into several different areas when discussing waterfall ice: Orient Point, Devils Gap, Planters Valley, Constellation Valley, Black Rock Mountain and Johnson Creek.  The North Ghost includes all the climbs along both sides of the Ghost River.  The North Ghost routes entail more of a 4x4 drive approach than the South Ghost routes. \n  \n The rated waterfall climbs in the North Ghost, meaning those specifically mentioned in Joe Josephsons Waterfall Ice, Climbs in the Canadian Rockies are listed in order as you approach them: \n  \n * The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (GBU), II, WI 4-5+/ 45m \n  (north side of river).  Located right above the river.   You can drive to its base if the road is open. \n * Silver Tongue Devil, II, WI 5R/45m \n  Valley of the Birds * Dead Bird, III, WI 3/ 45m (climbers right) Not in good shape in March. \n * Yellow Bird, III, WI 4+/ 45m (climbers right)  Takes some WI 2 to get to the base of Yellow Bird high up on your right hand side, fairly immediate as you start navigating the narrow canyon.    Yellow Bird is a fairly wide curtain and gives you different grades depending on which line you chose.   We went left which is WI 4 until you get to the cave.  There is fixed pro in the cave, looks like a rock line up and down underneath the falls at this point.   There are several bolts, but someone rigged a long piece of cordellete to give you a piece of solid pro as you continue on weak ice out the left or hard ice out the right. Either line was WI 5 in character in March, sustained and steep. \n * Seagull, III, WI 4/ 30m (climbers left)   Solo a real short WI 3 step to reach the base of Seagull.   The left corner is dryer and offers a better belay position.   The climb is best straight up the gut however and was on the easy side of WI 4 if not a WI 3 in March.   There is a rappel sling with a ring straight up to a tree, but it can be dry, loose and messy.  I advise top roping Seagull for the second. \n * Albatross, III, WI 3/ 100m (climbers left) Not in good shape in March. \n * The Eagle, III, WI 5/ 40m (climbers right)  By far the best and most challenging route in Valley of the Birds.   It is aptly named as it is shaped like an eagle.  It was in fair-good shape in March, slightly wet and chandeliery in places.     At the dead end of the narrow canyon, take the right fork and gain several ice steps.   The Eagle comes into view all at once on the right side.   Start up the base cone (which represents the tail feathers) and stay center until you get to the center of the wings.   Move left onto a small ledge/ice cave and continue up more solid ice on the left side to a tree rappel.  Sustained and steep. \n * The Raven, III, WI 4+/ 20m \n * Cuckoo Falls, III, WI 2/ 40m \n * Snipe Falls, III, WI 3/ 10m \n  \n * Unforgiven, III, WI 3/ 40m \n * House of Sky, III, WI 3-4+/ 500m \n * Phantom Falls, III, WI 4R/ 40m \n * Dirty Harry, III, WI 5/ 60m \n * Burning in Water, Drowning by Flame, III, WI 6+/ 30m \n * Sliver, III, WI 6/ 40m \n * Valley of the Sun, III, WI 3+/ 300m \n * French Technique, III, WI 2/ 700m \n * Going to the Sun Highway, V, WI 6/ 5.2/ 1000m \n * Beowulf, III, WI 4/ 670m (north side of the river) Dont let the 670m noted in the guide book scare you.  This includes as much horizontal ice as it does vertical.   As you approach the first pitch, few routes are as aesthetic as Beowulf.   The first pitch is twisted into two sections tucked deeply into a steep walled canyon (photo).  This and the last 2 pitches are the crux of this climb.   Several short pitches in between never exceed WI 2-3. \n * Devils Punchbowl, IV, WI 4/ 40m Bypass Beowulfs last two pitches up the short step to the right and trudge up canyon for approximately 20-30 minutes until the canyon walls give way to a broad open fork.  Take the left fork and hike 10 minutes through possibly deep snow to two perpendicular ice curtains.  The curtain on the left is WI 2 and the one on the right is more WI 4.      \n * Wee Wolf, III, WI 2/ 30m \n * Fur Face, III, WI 2/ 50m \n * Sitkas Slide, III, WI 3+/ 100m \n * Kelsos Curtain, III, WI 4/ 300m \n * Tuk Taku, IV, WI 3+/ 300m \n * Last Moose, IV, WI 3/ 100m \n * Husky Howl, III, WI 4/ 65m \n * Lupine Lunge, IV, A2, WI 3+/ 40m \n * Fang and Fist, V, WI 5/ 400m \n * Chikoot Passage, IV, WI 4/ 300m \n * Taiga Trot, IV, WI 2/ 100m \n * Werewolf Waltz, IV, WI 3/ 150m \n * Idle Incisor, IV, WI 4+/ 60m \n  \n The important aspect of the Ghost regarding safety is that you are on your own.  You are not always within the boundary of the National Parks and access can be difficult and long for rescue personnel.   I highly advise you take a Satellite Phone (for communication with loved ones who might worry if you get stuck) and always be prepared to spend the evening (read sleeping bag, shovel, etc).   \n  \n There are no permit requirements to enter, climb and/or park in Albertas Provincial Parks.   Cougars and Grizzlies can be more common place in the Ghost than the national parks due to its location on the front range.  Take bear spray during non-hibernation months.   This can be avalanche terrain during the winter.  Therefore it would be prudent to check recent notices posted on the Canadian Avalanche Associations website regarding that issue.    However, the ice climbs in the Ghost are considered less avalanche prone than most routes throughout the National Parks and Kananaskis.    The frequent Chinooks keep snow levels typically manageable in the Ghost. \n  \n There are no official campsites in the Ghost.   Random backcountry camping is allowed, but open fires are prohibited in the Ghost River Wilderness Area.   However, it appears that camp fires are quite tolerated by local visitors or even allowed in the Ghost River Valley around Devils Gap.  More camping information can be found at this site .   \n  \n The Kananaskis Provincial Park website is a very thorough park website, including trail conditions or closures, wildlife notices, weather conditions, avalanche conditions, camping permits, whitewater conditions, etc.  It is an excellent source if you are going to spend any time in the Ghost or surrounding area.   Outside of the parks web sites, Canadian Avalanche Association is also useful, particularly for winter travel.   Canadian Alpine Accident Reports are also extremely useful.   \n  \n Albertas Provincial Parks \n DowClimbing.Com"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134992f0cf0083295db3bd","prevHistoryId":"64134992f0cf0083295db3b3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":14,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:53:28.193Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:49.270Z","updatedBy":"fq3eNYT0WniICZn9opqKKg=="}
