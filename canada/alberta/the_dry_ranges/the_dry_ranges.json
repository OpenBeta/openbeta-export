Encompassing the eastern fringes of Banff National Park along the Red Deer River these mountains do not see much traffic at all. If you want to climb ice in an amazing setting with not a soul around and not much snow, this area is for you. Most of the climbs are located along the Yaha Tinda Valley road, a gravel road that is regularly plowed and accessibly by pretty much any vehicle with the proper tires and careful driving."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413457df0cf0083295d8cb0","prevHistoryId":"6413457cf0cf0083295d8caa","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:36:11.521Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:08.115Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
