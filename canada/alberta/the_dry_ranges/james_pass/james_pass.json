Posted here for completeness of info for the area.\n\nThis is a cool (I think it's cool, anyway), fully mixed route located in a rarely visited corner of the Rockies. It sits on the northeast aspect of Maze Peak in the Dry Ranges, overlooking James Lake and the prairies to the east. More than likely you'll have the whole place to yourself. The route does not appear to come in every year, so go check it out soon - who knows when it'll be in next? A rack of 6 draws, 8 shoulder-length slings and 6 or so screws is all that's needed.\n\nFrom the Eagle Lake/James Pass parking lot (see the driving directions for Dream On for how to get there), hike east on a quad trail. Easy walking across the frozen Eagle Lake, past Dream On and the other assorted Dream climbs on the left (north) side of the valley, takes you over James Pass to James Lake. Just before you reach James Lake leave the trail and hike right (south) 200 or so vertical metres to the base of the route. 2 hours.\n\nPitch 1 (30 m, WI4-5): A number of lines are possible, ranging from thinnish low-angle ice on the left to overhanging mushrooms in the centre. Belay from screws at the top left of the bottom ice flow.\n\nPitch 2 (25 m, M9): Move right to a small pillar and the first bolt. From the top of the pillar follow bolts left underneath a roof. Pull over the roof with a few big moves on small holds and continue more easily to a patch of ice. The ring-bolt station at its top is threatened by falling ice from the next pitch, so it's better to continue another few metres over a rock arch to a sheltered bolt belay on the right.\n\nPitch 3 (30 m, M7 WI5): A couple of big reaches on small holds gain a dagger (harder if broken off) and easier climbing up the right edge of a curtain. In spite of its large size the curtain does not appear to be very well attached to the rock. Given one of the first ascentionists' history with collapsing ice, this pitch was also equipped with bolts. Belay at a bolted station a few metres back from the lip on the right.\n\nRappel the route in 2 double-rope raps: the first from the top station, the second from the ring-bolt station near the top of pitch 2 (ignore a bad bolt a couple of metres to the right).Â \n\n<a href=\"https://cdn2.apstatic.com/forum/161507.jpg\"></a>\n6 draws, 8 shoulder-length slings and 6 or so screws"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"op3RJvgLWqSr5qtI2NMmZw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.44698,51.73067]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"64134582f0cf0083295d8cf3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:36:18.823Z"},{"_id":"It2PY4TxTBulKu14Kjlglg==","name":"Night Terrors","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Orvel Miskiw, Feb 2012","length":48,"content":{"description":"\nThe steep ice pillar pouring out of the cliff band directly between Nachtmahr and A Dream Come True.\n\nClimb 45m of steep ice to the top of the pillar, rappel from a v thread.\n\n\nThe shortest approach is to drive up Hwy 40 N and park as for the James Lake trailhead at 51.745369, -115.362015.<br /><br />From the trailhead follow the old quad trail along the creek bed all the way to James Lake. <br /><br />Once at the southwest end of James Lake cut off the quad trail and head through the trees trending right until you hit the obvious gully.
