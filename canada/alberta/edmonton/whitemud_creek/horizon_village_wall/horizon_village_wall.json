Climbing this is an art form of putting the least amount of force possible through any contact point with the wall. \n\nP1 (low 5th): Scramble up ~13 m to a cluster of small trees just a few feet below the base of the vertical wall, sling a tree to belay. Take the line of least resistance. No fixed pro, hammer in spikes if you need. Some groups may opt to solo this and rope up at the P2 belay station. \n\nP2 (5.9+): From the tree belay, continue the last easy meter or two to the base of the vertical section. Traverse right ~3m, building a sliding X off of 2 sets of 2 spikes. Just after the second sliding X, head up the weakness in the cliff band utilizing tenuous holds for stemming. Do not trust the fist jam out to the right, the flake will break off! Pass 3 more spikes and mantle out. Build a belay on the only suitable tree ~3 m back from the edge. \n\nTo clip the spikes either bring a set of nuts/draws, or alpines to trucker hitch the ends. Depending on the season, you may be able to front point the first pitch. \n\nFrom below, look for the weakness in the cliff band/open book feature. Aim for the cluster of small trees down and left of this just at the base of the vertical face. \n7 fixed spikes (5 alpines for 2x sliding X and 3 singles), webbing/cord for slinging trees, spikes for P1 if you want them."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"tEFknZ7iUgGAuz3a9BJk8g==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.56529,53.46853]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"641345d8f0cf0083295d8f12","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:37:44.773Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,af061e9b-545a-5119-8ac4-73ed280fb18d,2e286ecf-ecfa-5876-9a4e-2295a02c58b0,b441649d-9ee2-5201-80bb-3ddaf41264f2","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Edmonton","Whitemud Creek","Horizon Village Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.56529,53.46853]},"bbox":[-113.56604539595212,53.46808033981815,-113.56453460404788,53.46897966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"tEFknZ7iUgGAuz3a9BJk8g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-113.56604539595212,53.46808033981815],[-113.56453460404788,53.46808033981815],[-113.56453460404788,53.46897966018187],[-113.56604539595212,53.46897966018187],[-113.56604539595212,53.46808033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"A small wall behind the Horizon Village subdivision hosting Edmonton's first natural line.
