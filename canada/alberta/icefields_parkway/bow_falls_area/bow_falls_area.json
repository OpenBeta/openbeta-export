It can be climbed as early as late October, although be aware that it will likely be thin ice with a huge amount of water flowing underneath until a couple months into the season.\n\nClimb a couple pitches of low angle and possibly thin ice on slab up the huge shield, working your way climbers left into the final steeper pitch. Rappel to descend.\n\n\n\n1 - 2 hour approach from the Bow Glacier parking lot.
