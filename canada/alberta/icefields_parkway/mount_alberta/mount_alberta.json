Be ready for a full day and don't expect to nail the descent in the dark without a GPS track.\n\nFrom the base of the ridge, you can traverse right ~30m or go directly up. Either way regain the ridge at a fixed pin anchor and tackle an edging arete, being careful to test your holds and don't look for any gear before the next fixed anchor. Another two rope lengths will gain lower angle scrambling to the flatter portion of the ridge. Stay left on a ledge system, then ascend to the notch between the two large rock towers. From here the real climbing starts. Traverse on the north below the tower, climb the ridge around the right side of a small roof, then up left into a crux. Another rope length gains a ledge. Up and left you will find a roof and a short left-facing corner on your right. Take this into the base of a chimney. Up this chimney and another, you'll exit right on loose rock or left through a hand crack roof. Belay on a sloping ledge under a good crack just left of a thin left-facing corner. Follow this fun hand crack to the ridge again. Another half rope length gains lower-angle but loose and sparsely protected climbing. A couple more pitches or simuling finds you on the ridge crest traversing under snow on the east side to the summit. We belayed around a dozen pitches, though fewer could be done with more soloing or simuling.\n\nDescend the Japanese Route by following the summit ridge south through a 25m notch and a couple short rappels to a distinct, much deeper notch and the main rappel gully. Around ten 60m rappels, including the fourth(?) switching from the north to the south side of the gully at a pinnacle, will see you to the yellow rock ledge. Traverse here for a couple hundred meters to another two rappels, a short one with a cairn, then a full rope length, overhanging one around a corner to the south. Traverse down and skier's right through a choss gully, then skier's right to the end of a snow field / edge of a short cliff band. Here turn skier's left and descend scree, pick your way through a cliff band down and skier's right, then hang a skier's left to the end of a cliff band with a cairn. Traverse the bottom edge of this cliff band north until you reach the snow at the base of the east face. Cross the valley bottom and take the ledges below Little Alberta up to the hut.\n\n\n\nSee the mountain page for hut access. From the hut, traverse around snow slopes and scree maintaining height to the base of the northeast ridge\n\nSingles small to #3 or #4 (could be used but isn't required), optional extras .3-1, nuts, 60m ropes, rock shoes, one tool, and crampons"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"hFTsVAr9VQ2LSMX/jaHs/Q==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.47479,52.28877]}},"createdBy":"s7kTrf36V0aSnankAe7Zdg==","_change":{"user":"s7kTrf36V0aSnankAe7Zdg==","historyId":"64134670f0cf0083295d9561","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:40:16.768Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,6ab9f482-e47e-55ad-90e9-66e374e3bec1,8454ec54-0afd-550d-8b48-c5ff8da1ecfd","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Icefields Parkway","Mount Alberta"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.47479,52.28877]},"bbox":[-117.47552512070324,52.288320339818135,-117.47405487929677,52.289219660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"hFTsVAr9VQ2LSMX/jaHs/Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.47552512070324,52.288320339818135],[-117.47405487929677,52.288320339818135],[-117.47405487929677,52.289219660181864],[-117.47552512070324,52.289219660181864],[-117.47552512070324,52.288320339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"Mt Alberta is home to one of the classic north faces of the Rockies, the \"trade route\" northeast ridge, and choss-tastic Japanese Route / descent.
