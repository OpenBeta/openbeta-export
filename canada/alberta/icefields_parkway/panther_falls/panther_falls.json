Not far from the Weeping Wall and Polar Circus just up the Icefields Parkway past the Big Bend.  An excellent diversion if you have a bit of extra time. \n  \n The route get's early sun.\n\nMind the daggers on the left and right sides of the falls. The two most obvious lines are the left and right side, with the right side tending to be steeper, yet often more wet. <br />  <br /> The two approaches are to walk the trail from the south end of the parking area heading downhill and left from the Bridal Veil Falls sign and tashcans. Alternatively, one can rap in from the top of the falls from a tree (2 raps).  The climb is so close to the parking lot, so either way is quick although the approach trail has a bit of avy hazard. Although you can't see the climb at all till you approach it as the parking area is right above it, it's realitively quick to go check out.\nscrews &amp; v-threads"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"YP9mWqi7ULKXnojajIkIhQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.0573,52.1817]}},"createdBy":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","_change":{"user":"aphaw3XMUMKwNRHImuBAHQ==","historyId":"6413469ef0cf0083295d9701","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:41:02.045Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,6ab9f482-e47e-55ad-90e9-66e374e3bec1,60ff665a-a8bb-50b2-979e-88da8c890885","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Icefields Parkway","Panther Falls"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":3,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":3,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":3,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.0573,52.1817]},"bbox":[-117.05803334957619,52.18125033981814,-117.05656665042376,52.182149660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"YP9mWqi7ULKXnojajIkIhQ=="},"content":{"description":"Panther Falls is an excellent single (long) pitch ice climb with at least two variations that regularly form.
