Less than 10 minutes from the road and virtually no avalanche hazard make this a destination for all ice climbers. \n  \n Although you can climb about anywhere you please on the wall, there are 3 somewhat independent lines. \n  \n The Left-Hand (II WI4) is the easiest and most popular, with the steep ice on the 2nd pitch being the crux. \n  \n The Central Pillar (III WI5+) climbs up either side of the large cave (crux) found in the very middle of the wall.   \n  \n The Right-Hand (III WI5) climbs up to a long, sustained crux second pitch, followed by a short easier pitch to the trees.  You may be able to use a bolt-belay on a small ledge to the right after the first pitch. \n  \n The Weeping Wall faces mostly south, so ice conditions can change rapidly in the sun, particularly later in the season.\n\nThe Weeping Wall is 17.5 miles north of the David Thompson Highway, park at the plowed pull-out.  <br />  <br /> Several options exist for the descent.  There are rock stations leading down the Sniveling Gully route on the left side of the wall, and there is an established rappel route down the rock wall to the right of the Right-Hand route.  Or, you can rappel your route.\nIce screws for pro.  Bring cord for v-thread belays and rappel anchors.

Among the best, if not THE best, ice climb in the Canadian Rockies.   \n  \n Polar Circus offers nine pitches of ice, with the crux pitch last.  The bottom pitches are separated by some gully walking, which can be strenuous if the snow is deep.  Eventually you will reach the Pencil (WI6).  When formed this is a free-standing, 150' tall icicle. A most impressive feature.  Usually, however, the Pencil will be broken off near the top, and this being the case, climb up and right on easy ice to a bolted belay station.  While it may be possible to climb a couple pitches thin ice up from the anchors, most parties will continue up right, to some small trees that can be used for running belays.  After the trees, cut back left, and traverse an exposed snow basin back to the gully below the main falls.   \n  \n As you climb each of the upper tiers in 2 pitches.  Bolted anchors/rappel stations exist at the base of the upper two tiers, and at the top of the last pitch.  There is also a bolted station mid-way on the right of the last pitch.  You will also likely find some in situ v-threads \n Be aware of snow conditions and avalanche hazard!!! \n\nThe route is 27km north of the David Thompson Highway (Hwy 11).  Park just before crossing a small bridge over the drainage .  Follow the well-marked trail up the drainage to the base of the first ice.  At this point, if snow conditions allow, climb up a steep slope on the left for several hundred meters, and then make an exposed traverse (avi hazard) right to the base of the first WI4 pitch.  Otherwise, climb ice and snow up the gully to the base of the WI4 pitch. <br />  <br /> The descent involves between 9 and 11 rappels, depending on where you left your packs.  After rappelling the upper tiers, you can descend the drainage to a rappel anchor at the top of the Pencil, rather than backtrack the snow slopes.  This will save about an hour and it is an exciting rappel.  Be sure to check the rappel anchor carefully!!\nIce screws . . . all the way.
