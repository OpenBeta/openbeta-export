Most pitches can be doubled up on a 60m rope. Our group of 3 climbed on half-ropes, and linked 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11. There are a few steps that are at the grade, on pitches 5, and 7. The crux is on 11, where water runnels get thinner.\nDescent is either by walking off, or rapelling. We rapelled the full rope length on each rappel. We watched a group ahead get their ropes caught on the last. To avoid this, split the last two pitches.\n\nStarts from trees with flagging tape about 300m south of corner at north end.\nBolts, bolted anchors"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"nxzOw50YUhqJ/w5xgjw7Gw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.81623,52.88184]}},"createdBy":"jTFadKl3X/++wAYy1Jnpsw==","_change":{"user":"jTFadKl3X/++wAYy1Jnpsw==","historyId":"64134768f0cf0083295d9d87","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:44:24.584Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,8cda1dbc-abc7-5b35-ab47-fac80c20d2e7,9f1ccec3-9d18-521a-89ff-0e71823c3b1b","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Jasper National Park","Rainy Day Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.81623,52.88184]},"bbox":[-117.81697513575165,52.88139033981815,-117.81548486424838,52.88228966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"nxzOw50YUhqJ/w5xgjw7Gw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.81697513575165,52.88139033981815],[-117.81548486424838,52.88139033981815],[-117.81548486424838,52.88228966018186],[-117.81697513575165,52.88228966018186],[-117.81697513575165,52.88139033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"West facing slab, sunny from midmorning until late in the day.
