Within its boundary lies most of the Columbia Icefields and many of the highest peaks in the Canadian Rockies, such as Columbia, Forbes, North and South Twin, and Alberta.  Mt Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, is just off Jasper National Park toward the NW end (it is so important it is in its own Provincial Park). \n  \n In the summer huge campgrounds fill to capacity with everyone from RV cruisers to hikers, climbers, and bikers.  The town of Jasper is the hub of this region---it is quite a bit smaller and more remote feeling than Banff.  In the winter the place feels much more remote although still connected to Banff and Calgary by the Icefields Parkway.  In the winter the place is relatively empty aside for the lucky residents and the occasional visiting ice climbers."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641347a0f0cf0083295da03d","prevHistoryId":"64134798f0cf0083295d9fda","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":23,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:41:14.370Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:41:15.389Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
