The route follows the stunning left skyline of the mountain (see George's                        Mt Edith Cavell      ). \n  \n From the parking lot, take the trail to Cavell Meadows and then head up the moraines towards the bottom of the ridge.  The scramble to the start of the ridge is one of the looser more unpleasant ones around, especially by headlamp. \n  \n At the base of the ridge you may want to wait until there's a bit of daylight.  My partner and I arrived about two hours too early and felt that it was better to wait.  We tried to nap but critters kept trying to get into our packs, even with us sitting on them. \n  \n The ridge has a snow couloir on its left and the north face on its right.  Stay on the rock, but mostly on the left side closer to the couloir. \n  \n Depending on the snow and weather you may have bare rock the whole way (as we did) or snow and ice requiring crampons and an axe.  Most of the climbing is fourth class and the rock is generally good, but it's still wise to be wary of the holds.  If you pitch it out, you'll be there for days. \n  \n Roughly half way up the ridge there is a shoulder after which the route steepens a bit.  One or two sections might be worth belaying, they'll be noticeably harder than the rest and it's fairly obvious from below. \n  \n It's not a knife-edged ridge so it's possible to do many variations in a lot of sections, but if it starts to feel harder than the grade would suggest, given the conditions, don't be afraid to scout a few options. \n  \n I'll post some pictures when I get the slide scans....\n\nTo descend: Many, perhaps even most, parties reverse the route by downclimbing.  Another option is to descend the West Ridge route which makes for a very large traverse of the mountain.  The West Ridge is less technical (see the description once it's posted), but takes about six hours (but it could be a lot less depending on your fitness). Note that once you have crossed the summit and have started down the west ridge, stay on the ridge until the col with Mt. Sorrow.  If you drop off the ridge sooner you may end up in some nasty cliff bands. <br />  <br /> The West Ridge takes you into the Tonquin Valley which is relatively heavily populated by grizzly bears.  I have no faith in bear bells -- we blew whistles, which made for a very long hike out.  'Didn't see any bears though.  The most demoralizing part of using this descent is that at the end of a long day you have to finish by walking uphill on the road back up to the tourist parking lot since the trail dumps you out 2km down the road.\nOne thin shorter rope (30m even) should be plenty for any belayed sections or simul-climbing.  There shouldn't be any rapelling on descent unless conditions are poor.  A set of nuts and four or five cams up to hand size is more than enough.  If snow or ice is present, and you still want to climb it, equip yourself accordingly.  We saw no fixed gear at all."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Z29OQmkmWMOwpBzzUpwZww==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.0387,52.6686]}},"createdBy":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg==","_change":{"user":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg==","historyId":"6413475cf0cf0083295d9d21","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:44:12.846Z"},{"_id":"EPdvsFbpQTOjxTsB0rFljQ==","name":"North Face - Chouinard/Beckey/Doody","grades":{"yds":"5.7"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":true,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Chouinard, Beckey, Doody, 1961","length":1515,"content":{"description":"This face looks scary from the parking lot so don't linger looking at it. Doing the climb in a day is a long day but I'd recommend this. If you take bivy gear it will slow you down and it is best to spend as little time as possible on the lower part of this face as it is very exposed to rockfall. \n  \n Getting to the Angel Glacier is non-trivial and we checked it out the day before. From the parking lot, cross the stream and head up an obvious moraine that heads toward the cliff right of (and below) the Angel Glacier and Icefall. We found a low 5th class route left of a waterfall with one bolt and a few rap anchors on it. This is fairly easy to find - during the day! \n  \n Above here we wandered up and right on easy scrambling terrain, crossing to the right side of the stream that forms the waterfall.  Do not traverse left here or you could be killed by a falling ice block from the Angel Icefall. Eventually you reach some nice bivy sites at the edge of the Angel Glacier. If you know the route, you can get to this point in only about 1.5 hours from the car (even roping up for the crux cliff). \n  \n Rope up and cross the Angel Glacier. Above the left side of the Angel Glacier in the middle of the North Face locate a prominent pillar. This is the crux rock section of the route and what you want to shoot for. Below this the line depends on where you can cross the 'scrund. This section is mostly easy scrambling with a lot of loose rock. It's extremely exposed to rockfall so whatever you do, don't linger. \n  \n After crossing a prominent snow band about 1/3 of the way up the face, climb a pitch up a V-slot, then traverse right to the toe of the crux buttress. Three to four excellent short pitches lead up this buttress at about 5.7 in difficulty on stellar quartzite (some of the best rock I've encountered in the Canadian Rockies). It is great when you reach this section because it is spectacular and also the danger of rockfall is much less from this point on. \n  \n Above the crux buttress the difficulties ease and you can follow a rock rib on the left or snowy gully on the right depending on conditions. We followed the rock rib and this became quite difficult near the top where there was a short vertical wall dripping with water with a piton for pro. It may be easier to move right here and climb some snow or ice. It was extremely dry on the route when we did it and we were able to climb rock pretty much from the bergscrund all the way to this point (except for crossing a few snowfields). However I believe this is quite unusual. \n  \n At this point you reach the summit snowfield, which can vary from a foot of mush (when we did it, probably a bad idea) to ice.  It averages about 45 degrees, with some sections steeper.  Somehow the knowledge that a 2000 foot cliff underlies this simple snowfield makes it much more terrifying.  I recommend avoiding the shale bands just below the summit. They look easy but there will be absolutely no pro (so I hear). Traverse left to avoid the shale. Master the cornice (small for us) to top out very close to the summit.\n\nThe descent is by either the West Ridge (non-technical but long) or East Ridge (harder but shorter).  We went west. \nLight rock rack plus a couple of ice screws and maybe other snow gear (pickets, etc).  We also took crampons and two tools.  One weight saving trick is to bring one 8mm 70-100m rope. We used it doubled on the crux rock pitches, but single on the upper snowfield.\nGary Clark has attempted <a href=\"http://lamountaineers.org/NAC/browserf/climbs/edithcnf/beta.htm\">this route</a> several times, and you can learn from his experience in his <a href=\"http://lamountaineers.org/NAC/browserf/climbs/edithcnf/gc_899.htm\">write-up</a>. <br />  <br /> Bill Wright also wrote up a <a href=\"http://www.gibell.net/trip_reports/Canada2003.html\">story about our ascent</a>."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Z29OQmkmWMOwpBzzUpwZww==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.0387,52.6686]}},"createdBy":"Hs/Sy47yWsK46uXUbr0hLQ==","_change":{"user":"Hs/Sy47yWsK46uXUbr0hLQ==","historyId":"6413475df0cf0083295d9d2b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:44:13.334Z"},{"_id":"AbxsADFOQkWA24nzpSMXbw==","name":"West Ridge","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":true,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"A.

Edith Cavell is one of the most photogenic peaks in Canada.

I climbed the peak in 2003, and afterwards wanted to buy a nice poster of the peak.  Scouring Jasper I was disappointed to not find a single decent photo of this peak!  It seems its popularity has declined, or perhaps my memory of how great the photos used to be is poor.  In 2003 the tourist shops were chock full of photos and placemats with views from lake Louise and around Banff! \n  \n The mountain was named in 1916 for an English nurse executed by the Germans during World War I for helping people held captive to escape. \n  \n Among climbers, this peak is famous for its East Ridge, a classic moderate route with fantastic views, and its Nordwand which was conquered by Chouinard, Becky and Doody in 1961.
