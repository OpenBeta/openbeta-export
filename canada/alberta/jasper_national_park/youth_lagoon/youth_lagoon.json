With 27 routes to pick from, this slightly overhanging wall will give you a good forearm pump with its big moves on sloping holds. Best to avoid until mid-May, many avalanche paths lies above, a significant avalanche could make it all the way down to this narrow canyon.\n\nThis is a new crag, some routes are still in the works. Be respectful, and if dust accumulates on some holds give it a quick brush, all your friends will appreciate it.\n\nSlightly overhanging in nature this place tends to stay dry in the rain.\"\n\nNice canyon, single-pitch well-bolted sport climbs on Quartzite from 5.8 to 5.12+. Very featured steep walls with lots of slopey holds, unique for the Rockies. Gets lots of shade."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641347aaf0cf0083295da0ed","prevHistoryId":"641347a6f0cf0083295da06a","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:45:20.235Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:44.471Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
