Rock quality is subpar in places but overall if you don't mind pulling out a few blocks the positioning on the buttress is hard to beat.\n\nFrom the Wates-Gibson hut head south on a well defined trail until you make it to the moraine. Fire up the steep prow of a moraine hill with an obvious trail on it until the trail peters out as you angle up and right until it's possible to cut back left onto an obvious wide grassy (ish) bench. Traverse this bench until you make it onto the ridge and then easily scramble the ridge to the base of the first tower (if while scrambling the ridge it looks hard, go left). 1.5 - 2 hours from the hut to gearing up to climb.\n\nThe climbing itself can be done in as little as 5 pitches with a 70m rope (which is what we did), David P Jonesâ€™ Rockies West describes it as 7 pitches. In either case the climbing follows the ridge the whole way through 3 distinct towers. ~120m of climbing gets you to the top of the first tower on a nice long and wide ledge, then another ~100m gets you to the top of the second tower with another ledge. The final tower is a ~40-50m pitch to the top of the ridge. In all cases belays are on gear and depending on how you pitch it out you might have to get creative.\n\n Once you are on top of the ridge, you still have about 6 hours of adventure left. Scramble the ridge to the summit of Outpost peak, then head south down to the saddle between Outpost and Memorial, traversing the top of the glacier and navigating crevasses as needed. Gain the east ridge of Memorial and scramble that to the summit, before steeply descending and scrambling down the southwest ridge of Memorial. Once off the SW ridge, follow the moraine down back to the hut. 10-14 hours hut to hut depending on conditions and fitness.\n\n\n\n\nStandard alpine rack, bring enough gear for gear anchors at every belay."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"y5EQmt31WzK+CBeiN4rDtg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.25945,52.65074]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"64134760f0cf0083295d9d51","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:44:16.407Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,8cda1dbc-abc7-5b35-ab47-fac80c20d2e7,cb91109a-ddf5-5b32-be08-17a2378ac3b6","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Jasper National Park","Outpost Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.25945,52.65074]},"bbox":[-118.26019119148346,52.65029033981815,-118.25870880851652,52.65118966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"y5EQmt31WzK+CBeiN4rDtg=="},"content":{"description":"Outpost Peak is a minor peak in the Fraser-Ramparts range, but notably holds some of the most accessible alpine routes from the Wates-Gibson Hut."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64134760f0cf0083295d9d51","prevHistoryId":"6413475ff0cf0083295d9d4a","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:44:14.270Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:48.173Z","updatedBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g=="}
