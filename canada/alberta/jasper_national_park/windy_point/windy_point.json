Currently the crux has very licheny feet and you're above small gear for at least a body length as the crack gets shallow and flared until the crux moves (placed a #1 here but wouldn't call it bombproof for a big whip, however I did shamelessly hang on it while I sussed things out). Crux takes a 0.75 and a #1, and then a #2 a bit higher. Very fun hand jam sequence. Below that you'd want a 0.3 and above a grey or purple BD cam (which isn't necessary as the moves ease off but if you like stitching things up like me, nice to have.).
