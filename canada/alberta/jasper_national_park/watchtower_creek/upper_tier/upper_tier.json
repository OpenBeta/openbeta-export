Pull a tricky sequence protected by the first bolt to a good hold. This hold is so good, you should look down at your belayer and tell them how good it is. Move on, there are better holds! Bucket slam for a few meters, making sure to tell your belayer how good the holds are until they are about ready to take you off belay.\n\nThe wall gets a little bit steeper, and sadly, at least for a couple of sections, the holds get quite small. Solve a mini boulder to gain a flake high on the wall (sort of a left facing crack). Traverse left on underclings and turn the lip onto a low angle arete to clip the chains (left of the tree that hangs slightly over the edge of the wall). Lots of foot work required, \"Thank God\" holds where you need them!\n\n\n\nLook for the tree that hangs slightly over the wall, anchors for Mojo are just to the left. The bolt line to the right goes up a left facing corner/flake system and looks easy- this is \"Hot Carl\" which is a good route to orient off of.\n\n9 bolts, steel biner"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Rga9S83UW9O2iSs6rH2aRg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.79264,52.86222]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"64134793f0cf0083295d9fa1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:45:07.023Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,8cda1dbc-abc7-5b35-ab47-fac80c20d2e7,0847773d-ce12-5208-865f-bc8744aada4e,4606bd4b-cdd4-5bd3-b689-2b3aac7d9a46","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Jasper National Park","Watchtower Creek","Upper Tier"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.79264,52.86222]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"Rga9S83UW9O2iSs6rH2aRg=="},"content":{"description":"The Upper Tier hosts climbs from 5.9-5.12d, many of them absolute must do's!
