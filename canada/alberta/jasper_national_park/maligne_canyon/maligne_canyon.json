This would be a nice climb for photos, a route to take someone who is maybe not experienced (in good conditions) but wants to see some cool stuff. Basically the climbing is mostly 5-6 very short steps of 10-15 ft of ice, with the crux at the end being 70 ft of WI3. The ice isn't really why you're there, it's because of the canyon! The walls narrow to only a few feet wide in spots, and several cathedral style rooms are entered. The log jam was especially interesting, I thought we hit an impasse, but you just climb through the jam in a narrow spot. \n\nAll that being said, it is possible for the ice to freeze on the floor and if the water level drops you could fall through. Be mindful of this and test your footings. We did it when it was -35 Canadian Degrees out, so it was all very frozen and solid.\n\nPark in the Main parking area for Malign Canyon. Follow the tourists to the bottom, and find the gate. Step down and put the crampons on, and start walking up the canyon. Eventually, things get more interesting but you may end up soloing the short steps, or belaying off the ice in the floor. Continue to the top and walk to your car.\nA small rack of screws."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Vhc2pM7GXtKhfWP4mFphOg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.01632,52.92079]}},"createdBy":"36WfMJqxVJu4UprqSUfO4g==","_change":{"user":"36WfMJqxVJu4UprqSUfO4g==","historyId":"6413473ef0cf0083295d9bec","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:43:42.957Z"},{"_id":"aWQp/JlyS16inHi9Gy9n2Q==","name":"The Queen","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","content":{"description":"The Queen\n\nAnchor off trees"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Vhc2pM7GXtKhfWP4mFphOg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.01632,52.92079]}},"createdBy":"47JnjkWZUNS2qwEuoxM9Zw==","_change":{"user":"47JnjkWZUNS2qwEuoxM9Zw==","historyId":"6413473ff0cf0083295d9bf6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:43:43.419Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,8cda1dbc-abc7-5b35-ab47-fac80c20d2e7,561736a4-cec6-5ed2-a17d-63f8985a613a","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Jasper National Park","Maligne Canyon"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":4,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":4,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":4,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":4,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.01632,52.92079]},"bbox":[-118.01706580586074,52.92034033981813,-118.01557419413923,52.92123966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"Vhc2pM7GXtKhfWP4mFphOg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.01706580586074,52.92034033981813],[-118.01557419413923,52.92034033981813],[-118.01557419413923,52.92123966018186],[-118.01706580586074,52.92123966018186],[-118.01706580586074,52.92034033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"Fun climbing with plenty of on-lookers with the Maligne Canyon Ice Walk tours."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413473ff0cf0083295d9bf6","prevHistoryId":"6413473ef0cf0083295d9bec","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:43:39.838Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:40.240Z","updatedBy":"47JnjkWZUNS2qwEuoxM9Zw=="}
