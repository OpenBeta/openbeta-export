Rock is insanely loose and some areas are particularly exposed to rockfall hazard. If another party is already on the route, you may want to come back another day. A helmet is a must! \n  \n This is black bear country, take proper precautions on the approach.\n\nAbout 1 km after passing Medicine Lake there is a pullout with an interpretive sign for The Arch. Drive past the pullout (after checking it out, of course) until you see a small creek to your left with a great view of the Arch directly above it. Park at the gravel pullout approx. 100 m down the road on the right side.\nBolted and tree anchors. Bring runners and long sling anchors."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"1SFqqavBWgG4F5qFDOe0KA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.70066,52.8319]}},"createdBy":"XmmlZNusV/6JDGT3ci+oUQ==","_change":{"user":"XmmlZNusV/6JDGT3ci+oUQ==","historyId":"64134764f0cf0083295d9d6c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:44:20.224Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,8cda1dbc-abc7-5b35-ab47-fac80c20d2e7,d5216aa9-abc1-5a01-b817-9a850ce7b428","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Jasper National Park","Proposal Peak (Maligne Lake Road)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.3"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.70066,52.8319]},"bbox":[-117.70140427882927,52.831450339818126,-117.69991572117073,52.83234966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"1SFqqavBWgG4F5qFDOe0KA=="},"content":{"description":"Although the Maligne Lake area is quite crowded, this peak does not see significant traffic.
