Colin, to a 4th class scramble on treed ledges up to the Hawk-Colin col. 5th class sections are generally avoidable on these treed ledges (300 m, 1.5 hours).\n\nFrom the Hawk-Colin col, scramble 3rd and 4th class terrain to a pedestal leading into an au cheval section. You can build a pin anchor with KBs below the pedestal - follow the intimidating ridge directly, pulling around the ridge (easy fifth class) to gain a reasonable anchor (BD#2 cam and 1/2\" angle).<br /><br />From here a mix of short roping and short pitching on primarily third class terrain (with easy steps of fourth/fifth class) will get you to the top, staying on the ridge. You will reach a steep and overhanging prow with a ledge leading onto the SW face. Follow this ledge for 10-15 m (finger sized cams and fixed piton provide protection) to a 3 piton anchor (Angle, and two LA) in a dirty gully. If you have gone farther than 15 m, you are likely too low on the ridge, and following one of the other tempting ledge systems.<br /><br />Follow the gully, or the crack to the left (5.6R) past 3 fixed pitons to the crest of the ridge (40 m). Watch for big blocks that can be tempting to pull on: your belayer is in the line of fire. Short rope and short pitch to the summit.<br /><br />From the summit, descend down the SE ridge to a rap anchor on a slung block (28-30 m rappel). A lower anchor (10 m lower) is available if you only brought a 50 m rope. Continue down the ridge, generally bypassing difficulties on the right. Good time to practice your short roping and terrain belays.<br /><br />At the Colin-CR6 col, follow cairned scree down to the creek bed, following creek bed to the hut.\nStandard Rockies pin rack (1-2 LA, 3 KBs, 2 small Angles), 6-8 medium nuts, 0.5-2 BD cams, 4-6 shoulder length slings."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"QDanQIy4XD6nEdCTsKt5cg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.98826,53.00327]}},"createdBy":"uiGRLQRQWQmyWi2PnF1ryw==","_change":{"user":"uiGRLQRQWQmyWi2PnF1ryw==","historyId":"6413475af0cf0083295d9d06","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:44:10.269Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,27373ec5-14b1-5c42-8f51-8b5fac0a1035,8cda1dbc-abc7-5b35-ab47-fac80c20d2e7,4036a740-8cb8-5c3e-a711-d093b0ab7972","pathTokens":["Canada","Alberta","Jasper National Park","Mt.
