The creation of Nunavut  meaning \"our land\" in Inuktitut  resulted in the first major change to Canada's map since the incorporation of the new province of Newfoundland in 1949. \n  \n Nunavut is both the least populous and the largest in geography of the provinces and territories of Canada. It has an estimated population of over 33,000, mostly Inuit, spread over an area the size of Western Europe.
