Unlike most climbs in Baffin, this climb is a ways from the fjord. The first few pitches up a slab and then a large arch are chossy and were first climbed with some aid up to A2+ and mandatory 5.11. They go free at 5.11-5.12+. Pitch 7 is the crux, a very difficult boulder problem guards the roof of the arch, above, consistent 5.12 climbing leads to the anchor (5.13+). A superb thin crack (5.13a) leads to very beautiful and much easier terrain that takes you to the summit.\n\n\nThe route goes up the middle of the most attractive wall on the right side of the glacier as you walk up. The first pitch climbs a small left-facing dihedral that arches towards the left on top.\n2 sets of cams (inc. very thin), 1 ea. #5 and #6, 10 beaks, a coupe pitons and heads and 2 ea standard hooks. 60 meter ropes. The route can be rappelled, from the arch, go straight down."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"zjHVSOzzV/O94khkzbzTsw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-69.34177,69.72452]}},"createdBy":"oF0rvArFXuyf1CYMbtF7/g==","_change":{"user":"oF0rvArFXuyf1CYMbtF7/g==","historyId":"64143058f0cf00832960d4ee","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:18:16.317Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,6f233d1b-859a-5bfe-b1ca-246a5dbf326e,e112e034-8925-5e3b-8f07-5f883301fd35,c0ea01f3-e2a1-5c44-8915-6f881d8b0d66,4b459e92-135c-5a18-99a7-34edef2fbfa0,ce31d548-ecf3-57f3-bde2-4864cdbcd3b3","pathTokens":["Canada","Nunavut","Baffin Island","East Coast","Inugsuin Fjord","Belly Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-69.34177,69.72452]},"bbox":[-69.3430675923368,69.72407033981816,-69.34047240766321,69.72496966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"zjHVSOzzV/O94khkzbzTsw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-69.3430675923368,69.72407033981816],[-69.34047240766321,69.72407033981816],[-69.34047240766321,69.72496966018187],[-69.3430675923368,69.72496966018187],[-69.3430675923368,69.72407033981816]]]}},"content":{"description":"The peak is not very particular, but the East Face is about 2000 feet high and quite steep, especially at the bottom."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64143058f0cf00832960d4ee","prevHistoryId":"64143057f0cf00832960d4e8","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:18:14.010Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:17.660Z","updatedBy":"oF0rvArFXuyf1CYMbtF7/g=="}
