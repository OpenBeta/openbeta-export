The Pangnirtung Fjord sweeps back into the distance up the Weasel river and beckons you to go deep into the hills.\n\nCLIMBER ETHICS AND SUGGESTED LEGACY\nInuit kids love climbing, trying new things and hanging out with quallunaat (southerns). \nWithout getting into the \"hows\" and \"whys\" of colonialism in Pangnirtung, it's best to say that, you as a climber are extremely privileged to visit this land and share it with the Inuit. Therefore, if you can, plan your trip to have a bit of time Â in Pangnirtung to get to know some locals and utilize the bolted top-rope anchors up the Duval River."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","historyId":"6414304cf0cf00832960d497","prevHistoryId":"6414304af0cf00832960d48c","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:18:02.775Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:18:04.166Z","updatedBy":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg=="}
