If you fall, you will hit the glacier and probably die. \nP5: More thin nailing with big fall potential.\nP6: \"The Gong Show\". Awkwardly squirm up wide cracks behind the enormous gong flakes.\nP7: Follow the splitter crack on sometimes not-so-awesome rock.\nP8: \"Jenga\". Do not remove the wrong block on your struggle up this pitch.\nP9: Climb the steep and wild crack that splits the roof. Pull the lip to a neat ledge.\nP10: A long, wandering pitch with a cool pendulum.\nP11: Gingerly negotiate a heap of choss and then follow good cracks.\n P12: Continue up the same crack systems, passing a perplexing thin section, to a good belay ledge.\nP13: A legit free-climbing pitch on mostly solid rock.\nP14: A short easy pitch to gain the ridge.\nP15: Scramble along the ridge to a massive ultra-cool ledge. Take your harness off and enjoy the views.\nP16: Easy terrain along the ridge to the base of the summit tower.\nP17: \"The Labyrinth\". An awesome pitch on bomber rock. The difficulty depends on how lost you get in the maze.\nP18: \"The Splitter\". A splitter finger/hand crack. A real classic pitch. Would probably go free at 5.11.\nP19: Mixed free and aid up excellent rock.\nP20: Free climb a slab, aid a corner and then grovel up an exceptionally awkward squeeze chimney to reach the summit.\n\n- Most belays are bolted.\n- Belays 5, 8, 10 and 15 offer some shelter from rain and rockfall, and are excellent portaledge camps.\n- Climb pitches 11-15, and then fix 3 ropes straight down to belay 10. This allows you to haul direct up the smooth wall, instead of dragging haulbags along the 4th class ridge.\n- The summit tower (pitches 17-20) is outstanding, high-quality, super-bomber rock. \n- Descend by rappelling the route with the variations shown on the topo. Below P3, rappel using V-threads for approx 300m to reach low angled snow.\n\n\n30 Beaks, 5 Heads, 4 Arrows, 2 Knifeblades, 2 Angles, 1 Rivet hanger, 2 sets nuts, 2 sets of hooks, ice screws, 4 sets of cams to #3, 2x #4 camalot, 1 each #5 and #6 camalot"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"HmkT1g/1WJyVQoL7CwbDmg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-65.30474,66.41654]}},"createdBy":"DCvedagIU7eXOWfjfIMuDg==","_change":{"user":"DCvedagIU7eXOWfjfIMuDg==","historyId":"64143044f0cf00832960d44c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:17:56.811Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,6f233d1b-859a-5bfe-b1ca-246a5dbf326e,e112e034-8925-5e3b-8f07-5f883301fd35,f35ea58f-3364-58c9-a229-db634a30fdc6,1e6913d6-0ff5-589c-9542-82fb0b06c39a","pathTokens":["Canada","Nunavut","Baffin Island","Baffin Mountains","Mount Turnweather"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-65.30474,66.41654]},"bbox":[-65.30586391307675,66.41609033981814,-65.30361608692326,66.41698966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"HmkT1g/1WJyVQoL7CwbDmg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-65.30586391307675,66.41609033981814],[-65.30361608692326,66.41609033981814],[-65.30361608692326,66.41698966018187],[-65.30586391307675,66.41698966018187],[-65.30586391307675,66.41609033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Mount Turnweather is a massive rock which soars out of the Turnweather Glacier.
