The crux is the penultimate headwall pitch, a lieback/offwidth/squeeze. Originally done in 40 pitches or thereabouts, using 150ft/45m ropes; modern ascents seem to get it down to about 25. A line of bolts may still be present on the otherwise quite bold crux pitch; these unwelcome and unnecessary additions appeared a couple of decades or so after the first ascent and clearly detract from the challenge and commitment of the route.\n\nTrad gear.
