FFA Jon Walsh, Joshua Lavigne, Ines Papert (2012)","length":606,"content":{"description":"Jon Walsh considered this route \"very similar in quality and length to the Bugaboos ultra-classic Beckey-Chouinard\" (AAJ 2013). I haven't climbed the BC but I found this route to be magnificent with very high quality granite and quite sustained at the grade. It was also better climbing than the Scott Route on Asgard. As with any super remote alpine climb, it's hard to tell if we were on the same route as the FA or FFA team but the plethora of corner systems on the South Buttress provide ample opportunity to free climb to the summit. All pitches were full 70M rope stretchers and lower pitches involved some simul climbing as well.\n\nP1-3: Loose and dirty but easy somewhat wandering terrain generally aiming for one of the long continuous corner systems (5.7-5.8)\nP4-5: I recall P4 is where we established ourselves in the lower pitches of corner system, moderate climbing (5.9-5.10)\nP6-11: Outstanding, long sustained corner climbing. At least twice we needed to traverse from one corner system to another involving no more than 15-20' of face climbing (mostly 5.10+)\nP12-13: Corner system begins to break down as difficulty backs off and you romp to summit (5.8ish)\n\nDescent: 15 double rope rappels. We mostly found old fixed stations but there was the occasional single nut rappel.Â \n\nFrom the median moraine aim for a general area of weakness on the South Buttress just to the left of the cleft between the twin summits. A small snow field was encountered to get onto the wall. The route generally follows a continuous corner system up the face of the main tower. There is serious crevasse danger on the approach and if the glacier is snow covered use extreme caution and time your approach such that you are assured the snow bridges will be firm. 2019 was a dry year leaving the glacier completely snow free such that we could easily see all the open crevasses. We kept thinking how terrifying it would have been to navigate the same terrain if the glacier was snow covered...\nDoubles to 3, single 4."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"bByIagH2Vtu0eDNoetCnXQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-65.31647,66.6961]}},"createdBy":"U3L1KrMbULa4I/Rwo2cBXQ==","_change":{"user":"U3L1KrMbULa4I/Rwo2cBXQ==","historyId":"6414304af0cf00832960d482","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:18:02.181Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,6f233d1b-859a-5bfe-b1ca-246a5dbf326e,e112e034-8925-5e3b-8f07-5f883301fd35,f35ea58f-3364-58c9-a229-db634a30fdc6,6c1c886a-01f6-56db-b478-33687ad0a75d","pathTokens":["Canada","Nunavut","Baffin Island","Baffin Mountains","Mt.
