The ice-capped mountains are some of the highest peaks of eastern North America, reaching a height of 1,525-2,146 metres (5,003-7,041 ft) above sea level. While they could be considered a single mountain range as they are separated by bodies of water to make Baffin Island, this is not true, as they are closely related to the other mountain ranges that make the much larger Arctic Cordillera mountain range.\n\nThe highest point is Mount Odin at 2,147 m (7,044 ft) while Mount Asgard at 2,015 m (6,611 ft) is perhaps the most famous. The highest point in the northern Baffin Mountains is Qiajivik Mountain at 1,963 m (6,440 ft). There are no trees in the Baffin Mountains because the mountains are north of the Arctic tree line. Rocks that comprise the Baffin Mountains are primarily deeply dissected granitic rocks. It was covered with ice until about 1500 years ago, and vast parts of it are still ice covered. Geologically, the Baffin Mountains form the eastern edge of the Canadian Shield, which covers much of Canada's landscape."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414304cf0cf00832960d4a0","prevHistoryId":"6414304af0cf00832960d48c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:17:39.689Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:15.836Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
