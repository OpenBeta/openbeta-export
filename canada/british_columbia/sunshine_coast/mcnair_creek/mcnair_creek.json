They are located about a 30 minute drive north of Gibsons, just to the West of Port Mellon and can be accessed via the McNair Creek Forest Service Road. \" - From the McNair Creek Bouldering Guidebook 1st Edition. I think the rock is some sort of granite or granitic(?) rock? Similar to Squamish boulders but not the same. Lots of easy/moderate bouldering. V0 - V6 (as of Sept 2019)\n\n*Update* April 2020: There is now a gate at the start of the forest service road, right after the first fork in the road. Would be approximately 2kms along the road from the boulders."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141cbdf0cf00832960041b","prevHistoryId":"64141cbaf0cf008329600407","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:54:23.167Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:09.919Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
