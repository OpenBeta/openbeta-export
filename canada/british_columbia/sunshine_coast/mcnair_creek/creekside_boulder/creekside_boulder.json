Currently no clearly defined trail exists, although there are 2 or 3 inukshuks and at least 2 pieces of pink tape on trees to kind of guide your way down. You hike more or less straight down from the latrine area for ~15 minutes until you hit the creek. At which point there are a series of boulders that allow you to cross the creek. If there is a lot of snowmelt or water levels are high for whatever reason, you may need to get your feet wet to cross the stream, be extremely careful while crossing if the water levels are high as all the rocks are smooth and slippery. You should be able to see the Creekside Boulder as soon as you get down to the creek. Currently there are no other boulders developed at this area and it doesn’t look like there are too many other boulders around here. There are however, still plenty of lines to go up on this singular Creekside Boulder. Not a good place to twist your ankle, bring enough pads. I found that 2 tri-folds and a taco pad was enough.\" - from the McNair Creek Bouldering Guidebook 1st Edition by Eric Jamieson"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141cb6f0cf0083296003df","prevHistoryId":"64141cb5f0cf0083296003d5","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:54:28.615Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:13.129Z","updatedBy":"+77STgW0Vq++tIvWoL+Qvw=="}
