The hike up from the Desperado Boulder is about 15 minutes and fairly steep. There is also no clear trail (currently) from the Desperado Boulder to the Danger Zone. As long as you do not wander off too much to the left or right while hiking upwards towards the Danger Zone you should be able to spot the boulder. Be cautious of the HUGE death block waiting to fall off of the left hand side of this boulder. This boulder appears to be fairly chossy and Mike, Dylan, and I have pulled and pried off a fair amount of rock from this boulder already, including some large pieces that could have resulted in serious injury if they had fallen on any of us. Be careful, but donâ€™t be deterred!\" - from the McNair Creek Bouldering Guidebook 1st Edition"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141cb9f0cf0083296003fa","prevHistoryId":"64141cb8f0cf0083296003f4","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:54:31.240Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:04.286Z","updatedBy":"+77STgW0Vq++tIvWoL+Qvw=="}
