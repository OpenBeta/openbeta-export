The first 4 pitches are ready to go but they may still be a bit scruffy.\n\nP1: Bolted slab (5.7, 10 bolts, 50m).\n\nP2: Fine crack/flake to slab (5.7, 2 bolts, 35m)\n\nP3: The Lulu Traverse, follow the easy dyke to the left (5.5, 5 bolts, 35m)\n\nP4: Crack and slab ( 5.8, 5 bolts, 40m)\n\nIt is better to rap the route with double 50m ropes but you can rap with a single 70m from pitch 3, with a bit of a rope stretch on the second pitch (a bit sketchy) and on the first pitch you have to swing to your right to the forest. Watch the end of the rope !!\n\n\n\nThe route is on the big white slab left of Caradhras that you can really see from Psyche slab. 30 minute approach. Directly after the Caragdur Zip-line there is a crack boulder, go left of it and follow the old logger trail and pink flagging (if you pass the bouldering area on your right you gone too far). You will cross a big slab where a creek comes down, go up the talus after crossing the slab and you will see the formation after 10 minutes hiking uphill. The route starts above a big fallen tree.\n\n\n10 quickdraws with a few alpine draws to reduce rope drag, a single rack: black totem to 1''BD, double on small cams, nuts.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ZaFK8uRSUXuz+NSnGwnvgg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.2134,50.13708]}},"createdBy":"eINIlcx+Xp6lr+kkrxTEMQ==","_change":{"user":"eINIlcx+Xp6lr+kkrxTEMQ==","historyId":"64141ce1f0cf008329600566","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:55:13.399Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,5fe640ca-26d7-533c-bb3a-4c13a246cae8,4624f40a-b644-5256-9287-aa19002ce00f,3b388f4d-e263-5396-90e8-368807ca63f3,65a14af2-e452-517b-b3f8-d4a71b09ef82","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Sunshine Coast","Powell River","Eldred Valley","Caradhras"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.2134,50.13708]},"bbox":[-124.21410154936959,50.13663033981813,-124.21269845063038,50.13752966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"ZaFK8uRSUXuz+NSnGwnvgg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.21410154936959,50.13663033981813],[-124.21269845063038,50.13663033981813],[-124.21269845063038,50.13752966018185],[-124.21410154936959,50.13752966018185],[-124.21410154936959,50.13663033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"North east facing"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141ce1f0cf008329600566","prevHistoryId":"64141ce0f0cf008329600560","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:55:11.183Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:04.430Z","updatedBy":"eINIlcx+Xp6lr+kkrxTEMQ=="}
