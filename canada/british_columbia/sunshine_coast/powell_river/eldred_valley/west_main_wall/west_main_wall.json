Parties wanting to complete the route through the headwall should be prepared for dangerously low-quality rock, mandatory 5.9 R+ climbing on overhanging choss, and overall dangerous aid climbing on detached features. The 3rd ascent party recommends CoG as a great excursion to the headwall, but nothing more. The upper crux pitches are of incredibly low-quality and are frankly bolted in an unnecessarily dangerous manner. That being said the climbing is amazing from P1-15. All pitches are 35m or shorter, enabling parties to easily link pitches. A party competent with 5.10+/C1 climbing will find the climbing to the headwall challenging and amazing. A competent 5.11+ free climbing party will find the climbing to the head wall absolutely amazing, and well worth the effort to make it happen. \n\nSee description\nRack to three inches"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"OCXWFbFnW9uuGxzPziENDg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.2293,50.1606]}},"createdBy":"L4VeC9tlWSir0i1/3VGOaw==","_change":{"user":"L4VeC9tlWSir0i1/3VGOaw==","historyId":"64141cf1f0cf008329600619","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:55:29.472Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,5fe640ca-26d7-533c-bb3a-4c13a246cae8,4624f40a-b644-5256-9287-aa19002ce00f,3b388f4d-e263-5396-90e8-368807ca63f3,3825d615-b167-5bdb-ae1b-1ccfce210d0e","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Sunshine Coast","Powell River","Eldred Valley","West Main Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.2293,50.1606]},"bbox":[-124.23000189448034,50.16015033981814,-124.22859810551965,50.16104966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"OCXWFbFnW9uuGxzPziENDg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.23000189448034,50.16015033981814],[-124.22859810551965,50.16015033981814],[-124.22859810551965,50.16104966018185],[-124.23000189448034,50.16104966018185],[-124.23000189448034,50.16015033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"525m granite big wall. Hard aid climber's paradise &amp; the odd free gem to plucked still.\n\nAt mile 35.5 a rough road leads down to a large clearing by the river. From the end of the clearing a faint trail leads about 100feet into the bush, revealing a cable crossing the Eldred. After crossing to the West bank, head down stream, until you come out on an old road. This road forks after a short distance, go right. After about 300m the road forks again, this time take the left (uphill fork). After some time you'll come to another fork to the left, this fork can be difficult to spot, it is below the extreme right-hand margin of the Mainer, if you walk past it the road will peter out quickly. The road should now be traversing below the wall from right to left. After about a Kilometer a reasonable trail heads directly up to the start of the Mad Buggers Wall and Aarons route, Call of the granite. The Mainline is about 100m to the left. Approach takes about 1 hour from the West Side of the river. To descend follow slabs and flagging North from the summit, enter the forest and follow flagging. When practical Rappel .Continue down until it is possible to traverse the creek and logging slash back north to the end landing of an old road. Follow the road until you come out on the active Diane main road. Please be careful if placing descent vehicles on this road Active Hauling!! Mt bikes are a better option."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141cf1f0cf008329600619","prevHistoryId":"64141cf0f0cf008329600613","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:55:27.194Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:04.465Z","updatedBy":"L4VeC9tlWSir0i1/3VGOaw=="}
