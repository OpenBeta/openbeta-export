Caragdur is a 400m tall ocean of immaculate slab split by one massive roof feature (The Dolphin). The left side of the wall still sports potential for some nice longish free climbs if the gardening effort were put in. The middle of the wall is impressively blank and is so heavily clad with vegetation that big sections of the wall have fallen off in recent years from tree roots behind exfoliating flakes. The far right hand side of Caragdur is one of the Eldred's only high concentrations of moderate--challenging crack climbs, therefore making it the Eldred's best option for 5.10-5.11 crack climbers.\n\nApproach:\nDrive 1 minute passed the CAD Climber's camp, park beside or near the large sandy pullout on the right. An old road leads downhill on the left for 30 seconds. Turn right to find the zipline across the Eldred River. On the other side of the river follow the well worn amazing trail uphill for roughly 20 minutes to a junction marked by a long strip of yellow flagger. The trail traverses right from here and leads passed two rock slide paths. Another 10-15 minutes uphill while contouring rightwards along the wall brings you to \"Building Gondolin\", the obvious shimmering right-leaning finger/tight hands crack. Total approach time from CAD Climbers Camp is around 45mins, 1 hour for slow parties."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641772087eb87590e32e1369","prevHistoryId":"641771d07eb87590e32e1350","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T02:32:36.062Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:39.592Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
