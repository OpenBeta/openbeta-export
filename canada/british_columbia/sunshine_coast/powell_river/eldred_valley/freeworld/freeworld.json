Turn left and walk up the ridge for 150m towards the top of Carag-Dur, then turn right around a big tree. Pass a bunch of streams and follow orange AND blue flags. When you reach the next ridge, the trail splits. Ignore the blue markers going left and up the ridge. Orange markers lead in various directions downhill to a large ledge in the gully in front of you. Follow the ones on your right down along the ridge past a large tree that is split like a 'V' on an overgrown trail. In August 2021 the approach was a bushwhack from here. After a minute you find a big tree stump and drop to the left to land on the ledge. Thwack your way into the forest low on the other side. The orange markers go downhill, then up again to the next gully. Ignore the fixed rope going up left towards 'Itsy Bitsy Spider' and descend the ones on the right into the gully instead. Climb out of the gully on the other side using more fixed ropes. A few steps uphill bring you to the final fixed rope crux through angry cedar bushes at 50.145431,-124.230198 and up to a ledge. Plan 2-4 hours approach time."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"63e464e98da152d5a9a6ebb2","prevHistoryId":"63e45b228da152d5a9a6dd73","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T02:31:09.414Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T03:13:45.361Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
