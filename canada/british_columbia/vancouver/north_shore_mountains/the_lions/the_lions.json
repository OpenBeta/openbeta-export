With good conditions, you will be rewarded with sticky alpine ice all the way up one of the most iconic peaks in the North Shore Mountains. This climb is similar in difficulty to the Northeast Ridge route, though with much more actual ice climbing. Do not plan to attempt this route unless the avalanche conditions are in your favour. Access to the start of the route involves crossing large avalanche paths over cliffs that run to size 3 every year. Best times to climb this route are when the freezing levels rocket over 2000m, with maybe a little rain, and then drop to below 500m.\n\nThe route was solo'd on the first ascent, so the following pitch-by-pitch breakdown has been taken from parties during subsequent ascents.\n\nP1 - AI2+ (70m)\nP2 - AI3 out of cave (60m)\nP3 - Short step of AI3 then steep snow leading to the notch (30m)\n\nChop through the cornice and excavate the snow, looking for a Hail Mary root in the left rock face. Rappel approximately 20m down the opposite side of the notch until you see the amazing alpine ice leading up the northwest ridge. Alternatively, climb directly out the notch for a few body lengths at M5 (North Couloir Direct, Berman, Nielsen, 2018). You can build a piton belay at the crest of the notch.\n\nP4 - AI3+/4- in an amazing setting (50m)\nP5 - 40 degree snow to the base of the last pitch (70m)\nP6 - AI3 step then easy snow slopes to the summit\n\nDescend the scramble route down the south face. The descent starts immediately south, the slowly loops around to the west until you are in a notch. You can either down climb, or alternatively, 2 x 60m raps off trees will get you to the ground, then climb back up to the notch.\n\nRelevant links:\n\nhttp://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13201214757/West-Lion-North-Couloir-Direct\n\nhttps://northshorealpinism.wordpress.com/2018/02/19/fa-north-couloir-on-the-west-lion/\n\nApproach up the regular Lions Binkert trail; same as for the Northeast Ridge route. As soon as you get out of the trees, there will be a large open bowl on your left. Cross this bowl (high avy danger) and aim for the notch in the ridge that makes up the \"tail\" of the West Lion. Downclimb the notch (40 degree snow), gaining access to the north face. The entrance to the North Couloir is on the right side of the north face. 2.5 - 5 hrs approach depending on snow conditions.\n-Single set of medium sized cams <br /> -10cm - 13cm screws <br /> -a couple pitons to feel legit <br /> -pickets if you desire"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"poLXp4fRU7uu23vK9RvnoQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1851,49.4577]}},"createdBy":"E35pDIU5V62LsFkSleuqlA==","_change":{"user":"E35pDIU5V62LsFkSleuqlA==","historyId":"64141fcff0cf00832960210f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:07:43.190Z"},{"_id":"DykxTsK4R7qVGTtutEujqQ==","name":"Northeast Buttress","grades":{"yds":"5.6"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"FA Basil Darling, 1913; FRA D.

There looked to be some better options around, but everything was soaked. I pretty much gingerly balanced my way into some bushes until the rope drag was too brutal to continue (I had two pieces in with half ropes...)\nP2 (5.6) We climbed up a nice crest into a small roof, and bypassed it out right and built an anchor. 35m?\nP3 (5.6) Continued up for 50m on nice rock. Again, little gear and wet in a lot of places. I eventually found a nice steep hand crack (muddy and soaked) and belayed on a very small tree with red tat\nP4 (5.6) The wall above was slabby with no pro. Headed left then up to a tree, then straight up to another tree belay just below the talus (50m?)\n4th class:  We headed up the talus to a nice lunch spot on a bed of green\nP5 (5.6) Walk up to the steep wall, and bypass it on the left. Head up very easy terrain. We actually got about 30m and then just had my belayer come up and I continued on for another 50 or so meters. The book (Rich Wheater's Vancouver Rock Climbing) says this pitch is 5.4, but I think I ended up doing the 5.4, bringing the belayer up without building an anchor, and then did the 5.6 in the book. I belayed off of a giant flake and backed it up using a big dead log :S\nP6 (5.6) Head into the bushes right about where the wall steepens\nP7 (?) This involved steep climbing up dirt and roots. How does one grade this?! I finally found rock and belayed on a ledge. Beautiful views (50m)\nP8 (5.6) Go right (exposure!) and head up. Belayed on tree (30m)\np9 (5.6) Glorious exposure! Gingerly chimney then mantle onto a tower with loose giant blocks on top. Notice the scratch marks made by some fools who climbed this in the winter (Matteo? 2017?). Then head up the thin crest with rocks and trees. This was soo soo pretty. This was the best part of the whole day.

Parking is $25 for 24hrs I think<br />Hike up and keep taking the right option at the forks. Once it opens up, spot the gunsight. Another 150m up the trail or so take a sharp left and into the talus.

It's marked with red dots painted on the rock and has a fixed rope.  I highly recommend NOT using the fixed rope.  I fear for hikers who assume it's solid and pull themselves along it.  If it lets go, there's no recovery from a fatal fall.  Without the rope it's still only low fourth class scrambling. \n  \n The traverse is the crux, but there is a fair bit of steep scrambling to the summit and falls are likely to be very serious.  Take your time with the route finding as there are some detours, don't be afraid to backtrack a bit, especially on the descent.\n\nIf you were to climb it with a rope, you could place gear and sling roots and trees, but I doubt anyone does this.
