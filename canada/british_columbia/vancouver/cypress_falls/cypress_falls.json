The creek canyon has been popular for beginner canyoneering and adventurous family outings for a while. It is a very popular dog walking trail system for the locals and it's small selection of boulders were highlighted in the 1st edition of Marc Bourdon's Squamish bouldering guide book. There are a couple newly developed crags in the creek canyon that have sport climbs, and mixed gear climbs. It is quite cool even on the hottest summer days and takes a solid week or more to dry after a big rain. Definitely a mid-late summer hiding spot."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141dfcf0cf008329601245","prevHistoryId":"64141df6f0cf008329601202","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:59:04.710Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:59:06.982Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
