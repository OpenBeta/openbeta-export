Pads are not really required because of the soft dirt/mulch mix around the base, however it loves to stick to the bottom of climbing shoes, so a pad is recommended, even as just a way to keep your shoes clean."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414201df0cf008329602473","prevHistoryId":"6414201cf0cf00832960246d","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:08:59.027Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:06.118Z","updatedBy":"N9xDpIFwWTKsQ73FcA5bXw=="}
