It was not until the crack team of the late Guy Edwards, late John Miller, and Lena Rowatt took up the challenge, claiming the first ascent. Guy and John had passed away long ago in a tragic Alaskan climbing accident, while Lena could not remember details. In and around 2014, going off a hot tip and vague Barley memories, the Vancouver Rock Climbing guidebook author, Rich, began a search for the elusive route. In 2018 he found the route and attempted a climb, making it to the second crux before throwing in the towel. Based on this attempt and vague memories, the route is embellished in the Vancouver Rock Climbing guidebook, and given the grade 5.11a. \n\nAround 2016, Rich showed me a picture of the Howe Sound Redoubt Wall and I was instantly hooked on climbing the route. The lure of never having been repeated combined with the serene beauty of the surroundings and views kept me going back. The coastal jungle of ferns, salal bushes, and spider webs thwarted my first few attempts until I finally stumbled on an old trail marker and fixed rope leading up the backside. Alone, I sniffed out a sneaky goat path leading to the top of the wall. The rugged terrain and bush repelled any partners that may have been suiters. \n\nEventually, on rappel from the top, swinging around in space looking for signs of a route, I spotted a lone \"Barley bolt anchor\" - finally finding the lost climbing route. It was like being in a Central American jungle discovering Mayan ruins. The moss and lichen would rain down as the rope scraped across the rock face, sticking to my sweaty skin, coating me in black dirt after every trip. This was the start of many more trips up to the wall and me onsighting the heavily lichen-covered route. \n\nThe first thing apparent on my repeat is the crux pitches were way harder than the proposed 5.11a grade. With the steepness, and lichen-covered holds, the cruxes felt like 5.12. Questing into the lichen-covered unknown was a spicy experience considering the spacious bolting. I was regularly climbing well above the last bolt and in my mind, I became curious about the first ascent. Higher on the route, in the second crux, I discovered a bail-biner on a bolt. Lo and behold, I would discover this was Rich's high point from his attempt that same year. We will never really know the true story of the first ascent, but one things is for certain - the first ascent team were legendary sandbaggers that climbed ahead of their time.\n\nOriginally, this route began by scrambling up a fixed rope 10m to the left, reaching the terrace above pitch 1 on Throne of Kings 10b. However, now you can begin lower, on the ground, by climbing the fun, first pitch on Throne of Kings. Continue up face climbing on pitch 2. From the top of pitch 2, head straight up a line of steep bolts, through the first crux sequence. The rock is still a little scruffy but the moves are really fun. On the next pitch, continue straight up until it one bolt line veers left and one bolt line goes straight up a steep wall - continue straight up the steep wall above. This is the second crux, slightly more difficult than the lower crux. Above this, continue straight up to a horizontal roof, continuing to traverse rightward where Throne of Kings branches up to the left. You will reach an old bolt belay at the base of a 5.8 crack (need a single rack). Continue up the dirty crack, belaying off a tree near the top of the wall. The crack is and adventure in lichen and moss covered rock but it will go for those keen. The final 25m to the top of the wall is buried under moss.  \n\nVariation: stay on Throne of Kings, heading up left after the end of the horizontal roof on pitch 5, finishing with two more fun pitches to the top of the wall.   \n\nFollow the approach for Howe Sound Redoubt Wall.\n\n   \n\n\n<ol><li>Pull-up a fixed rope 10m left of the base area or climb the first pitch on Throne of Kings 5.4, 5 bolts, 25m. Follow the highly featured rock past bolts, trending rightward slightly, and up to a comfortable terrace with a 2-bolt anchor. </li><li>5.7, 7 bolts, 35m. Move 3m left to the base of the 2nd pitch. A single belay bolt exists. Step up around left to the face with a small ledge and clip the first bolt. Continue straight up fun featured face climbing to a comfortable ledge with a 2-bolt anchor.</li><li>5.11c/d, 8 bolts, 30m. Climb straight above the belay following a line of bolts (the left bolts are Throne of Kings 10b). Layback moves lead into a crux reach to face holds. Climbing eases above to the belay ledge with a 2-bolt anchor.</li><li>5.11d/12a, 14 bolts, 45m. Climb straight up from the belay. The wall steepens, becoming a bit cryptic before slabbing out beneath a steep section. Head straight up the steep wall above (crux). Use small flat edges with tiny feet. A crack sidepull out left will help you get to better holds. Above, climb straight up on fantastic big face holds ending on a great ledge with a 2-bolt anchor. </li><li>5.10b, 9 bolts, 30m. Climb straight up past 2 bolts using face holds and a key crimp. Make a few tricky moves left toward a crack then up the crack to below a large roof system. Traverse rightward under the roof continuing rightward, pass a line of bolts heading up left (do not go up here). Continue traversing up right towards a dirty 5.8 crack. Old bolt belay at base of crack. </li><li>5.8, gear, 30m. Head up the dirty crack belaying from a prominent tree at the top (Note: this crack is just waiting for someone else to give it a good scrub).</li><li>5.8, gear, 25m. Find your way to the top of the wall over moss covered rock. Belay on a tree. Note: from here you might (?) also be able to traverse over to the last pitch on Throne of Kings.  </li></ol>\n<strong>Variation:</strong> head up left at the end of the horizontal roof on pitch 5, following bolts up Throne of Kings 10b to a big ledge and 2-bolt anchor. Finish on the last 2 pitches of Throne of Kings 10b (see below). \n<ol><li>5.7, 7 bolts, 25m. Continue straight up from the belay, snaking leftward, then right, and back left to another fantastic belay and 2-bolt anchor.</li><li>5.7, 5 bolts, 35m. Surmount a small rock step to an easy slab section that steepens with easy, fun climbing to large rock steps and ledges and the final mini headwall. Pull a steep 5.7 move and step up to a nice ledge with a 2-bolt anchor. Finished!</li></ol>\n<strong>See topo in photos.</strong>\n\n\nBolts, 14 quickdraws, sinlge rack for the crack (pitch 6), bolted anchors with 2 tree anchors on pitch 6 and 7.\n\n\nYou have the option to rappel from the tree belay into Throne of Kings using a 70m rope or find a way to scramble/climb moss on rock to the top of the wall (~15m) and hike down the backside trail (4th class). From the tree belay, you may be able to scramble over left and finish on the last pitch of Throne of Kings. \n\n<strong>Rappel</strong>\n\nRappel from the tree anchor on top pitch 6 to bolts on top pitch 5. From there, rappel into Throne of Kings using a 70m rope. Use the anchors down Throne of Kings to make it with a single rope. \n\n<strong>Hike (30mins)</strong>\n\nHead into the forest and find the flagging, about 10m in, and follow the trail as it traverses climbers right (southward) across the top of the wall through the forest before eventually descending steeply back down around to the base. The descent trail joins the approach trail close to the base of the route allowing you to leave extra gear at the base and easily retrieve it after. The descent has 5 fixed ropes to aid through steep sections and short rock steps.  \n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"/Xpcm9w0UgOX7/fEZsbcBg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.24091,49.50284]}},"createdBy":"/wJHSPmCXh6lktIWpbGMpQ==","_change":{"user":"/wJHSPmCXh6lktIWpbGMpQ==","historyId":"64141f5cf0cf008329601dc3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:05:48.181Z"},{"_id":"STJXhilqRC27sQMQZB27Bg==","name":"Throne Of Kings","grades":{"yds":"5.10b"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Brent Nixon and Lisa Newhook Oct 2022","length":242,"content":{"description":"\nThis route combines 3 pitches from an existing old route, This Fortress Built By Nature 11d, with 5 new pitches to create a fun, moderate multipitch up the center of Howe Sound Redoubt Wall. The old route was reclaimed by the coastal jungle moss and vines, and previously repelled multiple attempts by savvy coastal jungle veterans to even find the start - let alone climb it. Once uncovered and rediscovered, it facilitated the addition of a modern bolted route.        \n\nAlthough this entire route is bolted, it is not a sport climb. Combined with the overall adventurous nature of the approach, climb, and descent, it is more analogous to a small alpine climb. The bolting is safe however, there is mandatory climbing above bolts and you will not be able to pull through the cruxes. Like any new route, and especially on longer multipitches, there is always the chance for loose rock and holds that might break. \n\nPitch lengths were planned to be 35m or less in order to eliminate rope drag while allowing you to rappel with a single 70m rope. All belays are on comfortable ledges with bolted anchors and rappel rings.

He followed remnants of old logging road up from Hwy99, battling sword ferns head height, epic spider webs, and steep rough terrain to forge a climbers trail to the base.\n\nRock on this cliff is highly textured and featured good quality, granitic rock. Flat top holds, in-cut jugs, and side-pulls are plentiful even when the climbing is steep. Cracks are rare. Face climbing is the dominant style peppered with fun laybacking on flake features. Overall the cliff rises about 240m from the base to the summit providing a multipitch experience with unparalleled views over Howe Sound.
