It is shady and coola better place than most to climb on a sweltering sunny afternoon. Also, because it faces west, Sullys benefits in the late afternoon and early evening from about as much sunlight as can be expected  \n  \n Sullys can be very slow to dry out after a rain, especially in the spring and fall.  \n  \n It is a good place to go after work but the size of the crag and proximity to Vancouver can leave it crowded. \n  \n Sport climbingall boltedat a variety of grades. There are some excellent moderates, but the crag tends to feature difficult and bold sport routes that are very challenging for the average weekend warrior. Whatever the grade, the climbing is always interesting. In places, the rock is highly featured and varies from slab to overhanging with fractures, cracks, and even roofs thrown in for good measure.  There is about 25 routed in total. \n  \n A topo can be downloaded here \n  squamishclimbing.com/topos/… \n also you can find the topo on the quickdraw publications website. \n  \n Not on the topo: 2 additional 5.9s on the North area, beside \"lefty\" and a 5.7 as well. \n  \n A lot of the routes have the name and grade written on the rock in Black marker(insert ethical discussion here), some of the grades on the rock are different than the topo.  \n  \n This description has been compiled from the topo and Squamishclimbing.com as well as my own observations.."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414204df0cf008329602755","prevHistoryId":"6414204df0cf00832960274b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":40,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:09:26.441Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:04.227Z","updatedBy":"a6f1A9RaXsC2TekaPsTU/w=="}
