A long slog of a hike leads to some enjoyable scrambling with great views.\n\nFrom the infamous double gates:\n\nPass the gates and continue down the road, loosing approx 250m of elevation. At roughly the 7th(?) switchback, there is a faint trail going off into the bushes on the right. There are a few pieces of faded flagging tape marking the start of the trail. It is easy to miss.\n\nTrailhead Location: 49.37766, -122.32405\n\nOnce off the road, the trail continues to descend slowly to lake level. Continue along for about 2km to the end of the lake. The trail then turns left and starts to gain elevation slowly through the forest. Around the 3km mark is when the steepness increases. The next 2km are very steep and slightly overgrown, but throughout, the trail is very well marked with orange flagging tape. \n\nRoughly 5km from the start of the trail, you finally break through the tree-line to the boggy and buggy \"tarns\", commonly used as a bivy location if doing the route over two days. \n\nFrom here, continue NW along the ridge to the base of the slabs. Follow the slabs up and left to reach the permanent snowfield. Cross the snowfield further NW to more slabs. Scramble across the slabs until you reach the first crux gully located ROUGHLY here: 49.42536, -122.34558\n\nClimb the 4th/low-5th class gully up past the rappel chockstone. Continue up the loose gully to another 4th class crux. \n\nOnce at the end of the gully, continue across more slabs, then traverse around the false summit to the West on a moderately-exposed ledge. \n\nThis should place you at the start of the enjoyable 1km-long ridge to the summit. \n\n\n\nFrom Dewdney Trunk Road, turn onto the Florence Lake FSR and follow it for approx 20km. Follow the FSR straight, for the first 10km or so. Eventually you reach a Y-junction with a sign for Rocky Point going to the right. Turn left here. \n\nContinue down the FSR and make a left at an unmarked side road located here:\n\n49.36949, -122.32483\n\nThis is an easy turn to miss. Continue down the small road for about a kilometre until you reach the infamous \"double gates\". Park in the small pullout on the left.\n\nParking area located here:\n\n49.37122, -122.32585\n\n\nCross Allouete Lake to the far North side of the lake. \n\nThere is a small rocky beach that a canoe or kayak could be landed and tied off to tree located here: 49.38945, -122.31852\n\nThe approach trail passes by the beach a few metres to the North.\n\nHelmet, 30m rope (if rapping cruxes), ice axe and crampons (depending on conditions)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"UemMFGpnWm+i4rgUTxUJPg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.35588,49.4317]}},"createdBy":"N9xDpIFwWTKsQ73FcA5bXw==","_change":{"user":"N9xDpIFwWTKsQ73FcA5bXw==","historyId":"64141f47f0cf008329601ccf","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:05:27.532Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,7bfa8f08-dcba-5bd2-9b84-a2b961d17e38,1cd69f08-f50e-5173-acf8-483b8b31c200,51e98c14-6a67-5a6f-a2e2-b8144f15093e","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Vancouver","Golden Ears Provincial Park","Mt.
