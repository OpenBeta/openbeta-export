Situated just west among the extravagant homes of West Vancouver, this area consists mostly of seacliffe-style climbing and bouldering on featured seaside granite. \n  \n The most popular climbing routes are off of Juniper Point. These routes can be crowded (especially near sunset on weekends), however much of the bouldering and other cragging areas see little crowds.  \n  \n UPDATE: For first ascentionists, no routes may be laid (i.e cleaned and bolted) in areas of significant vegetation. Consult Vancouver Parks for more information."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141f73f0cf008329601eaa","prevHistoryId":"64141f66f0cf008329601e17","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:05:50.338Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:05:52.586Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
