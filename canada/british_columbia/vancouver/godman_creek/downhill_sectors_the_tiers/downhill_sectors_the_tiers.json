The walls range from less than 2 meters (the end of Marshmallow Rock) to the tall wall in the middle of the Second Tier (15 meters). In general, the problems here are often slabby (e.g. the Mountain Bike Slabs), but sometimes relatively high (e.g. Moby Dick (V1) or Twice Shy (V2)). Several harder lines are here, as well (e.g. Superball)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141f08f0cf008329601a97","prevHistoryId":"64141ea2f0cf0083296018cb","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:00:19.138Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:00:20.998Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
