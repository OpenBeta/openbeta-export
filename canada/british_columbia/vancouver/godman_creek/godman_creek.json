Near its headwaters, Godman Creek flows from a small valley carved by glaciers into the side of Cypress Mountain. On the uphill (north) slope of the small valley are numerous small southwest-facing cliffs ranging in height from 2  6 meters. These cliffs (the Uphill Sectors) generally provide relatively steep climbing in the sun on clean, well-featured granite, although they do tend to seep extensively after days of rain. On the south (downhill) side of the valley are two small granitic domes with numerous small cliffbands ranging in height from 2  10 meters. These cliffs  the Tiers  provide climbing on a variety of angles that, although in the shade, tend not to seep extensively after rain."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141f0ef0cf008329601ae4","prevHistoryId":"64141e13f0cf00832960137d","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:00:16.624Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:13.156Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
