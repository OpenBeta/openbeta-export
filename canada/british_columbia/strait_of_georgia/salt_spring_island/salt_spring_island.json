The routes are all contained on Mt. Maxwell, while the bouldering is found in two areas: near Vesuvius, and near Burgoyne Bay. The guidebook is available by contacting the author directly gusoliveira@yahoo.ca. I highly recommend purchasing the guidebook to help support the local climbing community, but barring that the information on these pages will hopefully help you find your way."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141c47f0cf0083295fff1e","prevHistoryId":"64141c46f0cf0083295fff18","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:52:36.004Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:52:38.055Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
