Blocks of Sandstone from this very quarry were used in the Victoria Parliament building. Recent cleaning efforts are slowly establishing new routes as the quarry has not previously been recreationally used. The sandstone here is not bomber, so no bolting has yet been undertaken and climbs are currently all trad or toprope.
