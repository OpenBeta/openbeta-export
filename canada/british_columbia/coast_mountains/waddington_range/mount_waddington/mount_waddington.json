Allen Steck, of the famous Steck-Salathe on Yosemite's Sentinel Rock, was part of a big Sierra Club expedition. They float-planned to a lake fifteen kilometers away from where Mike King lands today. The first ascent camped at 12,200 feet, left camp at 3:30am, and summited by 1:30pm.\n\nEsther Kafer was the first woman to climb Waddington's main summit tower. (CAJ, about 1963)\n\nAllen Steck returned with Dick Culbert, Bob Cuthbert, Barry Hagen, Bill St Lawrence, and Les Wilson for the first winter ascent, February, 1969.\n\n\n\nWhen to climb Mount Waddington poses a dilemma. During the long days of early summer, the Bravo Glacier is safer to climb, but the summit tower may still be shedding big chunks of the winter's ice-feathers down the route. Once the summit pinnacle is free of the ice threat, the crevasses of the Bravo Glacier will have opened up, making passage difficult. If crevasses force the route closer to either Bravo Peak or Spearman, then climbers are exposed to avalanches.\n\nFor most heli-supported expeditions, the climb begins from the top of Rainy Knob. Large crevasses on the Tiedemann Glacier convince most parties to both land and camp on the knob. Since flying happens during daylight, it will be too late to start climbing the Bravo after flying in. Climbing literature is full of reported near-misses by snow, ice, and rock falling down the Bravo. It won't be a waste to spend time on the knob observing avalanche hazards and getting ready for a proper alpine start the next day.\n\nThe route up the Bravo Glacier is ideally centered between Bravo Peak's east ridge and the lesser southeast rib. The rib and ridge join up high, forming a cul-de-sac. Climbing out of the cul-de-sac, over the southeast rib, is the crux of the glacier travel. Big avalanches from high on Spearman Peak make it important to cross the rib as close to Bravo Peak as seems safe.\n\nOnce over the rib, the next goal is the Bravo-Spearman Col. Setting up a camp here is possible. From the flat col, two kilometers of easier glacier travel are needed to reach the final snow-slopes. 1,700 feet of steeper, but \"easy\", glacier leads to the Tooth, a spectacular sub-summit.\n\nA bergschrund has to be crossed and short snow slope ascended to get on the rock of the Tooth. A fourth class ledge, or ramp, traverses right, across the width of the Tooth, to the notch between the Tooth and summit tower. From the notch, a narrow rock ridge is crossed to reach the chimney that leads to the summit.\n\nThe chimney has about 250 feet of \"easy\" fifth class, passing three chockstones along the way. The third is the crux, and even in dry conditions, some teams aid around the last chockstone via fixed pins. From the top of the chimney, traverse right to the final summit gully, fourth class.\n\nThe upper rappels can get stuck on ice feathers and loose blocks. After rappelling the chimney back to the Tooth-South Summit notch, down-climb the ramp to a final rappel past the Tooth's bergschrund.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"VGsCxtwhXX6uktA3vAp/tA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-125.26319,51.3732]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6413fb6ff0cf0083295e7e7e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:32:31.652Z"},{"_id":"0Wm60wOKRp2W28u7Q7KsJw==","name":"Kiwi Route","grades":{"yds":"5.7"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":true,"ice":true,"mixed":true,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Annette Richards and Stuart Ross, Sept 18, 1979.","length":939,"content":{"description":"The Kiwi Route is a direct and appealing \"approach\" to the summit tower of Waddington from Combatant col. It takes a relatively protected line up a rib of snow and ice through the otherwise threatened North face, reaching \"the stroll\", a ramp of snow below the summit tower. The standard finish is via the notch chimmney. From a camp on the Col, it should be possible to go up and down in a day with good conditions.\n\nThe route breaks up nicely into three sections. After a short (5min) threatened walk through a debris field, the Bergschrund is crossed at about 9900'. From here, overhead hazard drops and the climbing begins. an 800 foot section of 45-60 degree ice pumps the calves and deposits you on a breathtaking 50 degree snow arete. After this, puzzle your way through a short icefall and walk up lower angle snow.\n\nThe summit tower features steep mixed climbing on featured rock. For most of the year wild rime formations are present. \n\nCross the last schrund well left of the notch, and climb a ramp. Follow weaknesses with 4th-low 5th class movement up and right on the face of the Tooth. After reaching the notch, 2 rope stretching pitches of steep mixed climbing give way to easier terrain. In the Don Serl book, difficulties are described as 5.7 with some A0 pulls on fixed gear to surmount chockstones. We found most of this fixed gear encased in ice, and pulling these overhangs free felt like about M4-5 in Colorado. We encountered several sections of steep ice, one of which was about 3 bodylengths long. Rock gear was usually present. Normally 4-6 pitches from the notch will land you at the summit.\n\nLocation: The furthest route left(SE) on the north face from Combatant Col. Cross the schrund as far left of the seracs as possible <br />  <br /> Descent: it is possible to reverse the route with extensive down-climbing, but the preferable option is to rappel the summit tower (4 raps with double 70m ropes), climb back up a short couloir to the shoulder of the NW summit, and then descend the angel glacier via the Firey route.  This involves mostly walking, though finding the easy way through the icefall involves some trial and error. Several sections are threatened from above by relatively active seracs.\n2-tools, Light rock rack, 3-7 cams, emphasis on pins and wires. 4-6 ice screws. Lots of long runners.
