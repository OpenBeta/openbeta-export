One and a half days up, half a day down the south slopes.\n\nThe first 16 to 18 pitches climb mid-5th rock to 5.7 left of the crest of the lower buttress to reach the prominent mid-height snowpatch. Turn the arete and bivi on good ledges on the north side. Three pitches up the first low-angle ice arete (probably snow in early season) lead to three loose mixed and rock pitches up the rock band between the two ice patches. More ice and rock climbing on the upper arete leads to the east summit. A long 4th class traverse of the summit ridge leads to the cairn on the west summit.Â \n\nIn some places in 2004 the ice had melted back enough that it was possible to walk along rock sidewalks next to the edge of the ice with a 3000' drop below. \n\n\n\nThe obvious NE buttress.
