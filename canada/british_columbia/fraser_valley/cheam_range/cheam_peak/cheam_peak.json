From the snow/talus slope beneath the North Face take avalanche runouts to a wooded knoll in the center of the base of the North Face. Ascend a pocket glacier here, then cut back back left across a rock band for one lead. In winter a 100m/300 ft couloir on the right may be used. Another 1 1/2 leads on snow then take you to the upper rock wall. Traverse right along the base of this wall for 3 leads to a corner, then follow easier snowand rock up to a point where the northwest ridge blends into the face. About 100m of class 3/4 scrambling on poor rock then lead to the west ridge. The FA party made their exit about 100ft west of the summit. Knifeblades and horizontals are recommended for belay stations. The climb takes a long day from the Highway."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"jnJst3lDWYaXZSkA+uK26Q==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.6829,49.1855]}},"createdBy":"lYLSBl+cVo6B1rRDoogVjA==","_change":{"user":"lYLSBl+cVo6B1rRDoogVjA==","historyId":"6413fbb6f0cf0083295e816d","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:33:42.685Z"},{"_id":"KhBpXhOPSCitEJXV3vFqOg==","name":"Northwest Face","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":true,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"FA/FWA Bruce Kay, Carlo Zozikyan 1987","length":909,"content":{"description":"\nThe west or northwest face of Cheam can be approached a couple of different ways. The original ascent went up the couloir above the Slokana log house mill and found some steep ice up high. More recent ascents used a vague trail just west of the gully draining the bowl at the base of the face. Either way, once in the bowl, climb up to the top of the highest knoll below the faace then head straight up to the unavoidable rockband. Thin ice across the rockband leads to a traverse left and a short chimney. The upper snowslopes are steep and cornice threatened in late season and spring.

It can be hiked from the Cheam-Lady Col (Class 2) and takes at most 4 hours to complete. However, this peak also has several more difficult roues to the summit. The impressive NW (class 4 winter route) and North (class 4 to 5) faces can be seen from the town of Agassiz and the NE ridge is a class 4. Cheam Peak is made up of the loose and flaky volcanic rock that is common in the Cheam Range and Rock Fall is a hazard on the steeper routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413fbb7f0cf0083295e8177","prevHistoryId":"6413fbb6f0cf0083295e816d","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:33:39.581Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:42.908Z","updatedBy":"lYLSBl+cVo6B1rRDoogVjA=="}
