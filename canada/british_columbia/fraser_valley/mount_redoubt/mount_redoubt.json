From Bear Lake, the Southern Route of Mt Redoubt avoids crevasses and is just snow and exposed scrambling.   \n  \n Unfortunately, hiking through the forest of Bear Creek, to get to Bear Lake, is brushy.  Beckey recommends Indian Creek as less bushy.  \n  \n Another, longer, way avoids the bushes by traversing high ridges from Whatcom Pass to Bear Lake.  A chasm blocks the ridge hike above Indian Creek's headwaters.  Dropping off the ridge into upper Indian Creek could require a rappel from small trees.  \n  \n ROUTE  \n  \n From the base of the south side snowfield, climb the snow, first passing  through a cliff band , then follow easier terrain leftwards, and finally up an exposed gully to the top. \n  \n EQUIPMENT \n  \n Ice Axe, crevasse rescue kit, boots, crampons, rope, and a small rack."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"OPrQMFpvVr2qbJfrx0ggdg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.30259,48.9594]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6413ff73f0cf0083295eaf0b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:49:39.324Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,55e34f67-cad5-5352-bfdc-7974184c8abd,38fad030-5a6f-56bd-aa6c-97ebc7482076","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Fraser Valley","Mount Redoubt"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.30259,48.9594]},"bbox":[-121.30327483784293,48.95895033981815,-121.30190516215707,48.95984966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"OPrQMFpvVr2qbJfrx0ggdg=="},"content":{"description":"The second-highest peak of the Chilliwack Range (Spickard is slightly higher), almost 1,000 feet higher than either Slesse Mountain or American Border Peak.
