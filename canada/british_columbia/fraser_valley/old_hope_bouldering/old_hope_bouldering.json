A 1km stretch of boulders along HWY 1 with 300+ problems which include three of the best problems in western Canada, Leviathan V9, Blade of Lightning V10, and Nautilus V10. \n  \n This was the first area in the Valley to see development back in 1998. Lack of traffic over the past few years has caused second growth to appear on most of the boulders, but a large scale cleanup is now underway."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413ffb0f0cf0083295eb1fc","prevHistoryId":"6413ffabf0cf0083295eb1d7","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:49:59.216Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:12.555Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
