Beckey, M. de Jong, J. Svensson 1987  Speedway: K. Wild, R. Mooney, A. Commazetto, 1996","length":455,"content":{"description":"This route has a convoluted history and great climbing. In 1987, Fred Beckey, Maxim de Jong, and Joanne Svensson climbed a long and seriously runout route on the southwest flanks of Yak, weaving around to link up features where they could establish gear belays. Fred didn't think it was the greatest route. In the 90's, Roland Mooney and partners, unaware of the earlier ascent in the same vicinity, brought a powerdrill and established a bold slab climb that takes a more direct line through the same general terrain as the earlier ascent, using bolted belays to straighten out the climbing. The two climbs are very close to each other and today, the Speedway route makes the most sense as an ascent. \n  \n Begin in the centre of the SW face, near a small dead tree with a blue sling on it, directly below a faint white streak. The first five pitches are very easy (4th class through 5.3). The first three pitches feature almost full-length (50m) runouts between bolted stations; there is one bolt on the third pitch, which is easy to miss. Also,the first bolted anchor is very hard to see from the ground. \n  \n The 4th and 5th pitch angle slightly left and feature flake sections with good TCU or nut placements. Both are 5.3. \n  \n The sixth pitch is where the climbing gets serious. The rock steepens somewhat. Climb up to an overlap, clip a bolt, and run it out 25m past the bolt to a bolted hanging  belay on a diagonal seam (clipping the pack to the belay and sitting on it can be a good way to rest the feet and calves). \n  \n The seventh pitch is committing; step off the hanging belay and run it out 20m or so on sustained 5.7  to the first bolt, then a similar distance to the second, then 10m or so more to the anchor, on a welcome ledge. \n  \n The 8th pitch is 4th class with some loose rock; climb up and left on ledges to another bolted belay below a flake. \n  \n The 9th pitch climbs a short flake (nuts and/or camalot for pro), then climbs glacier polish with spaced edges past two well-spaced bolts (5.8 crux) to a bolt belay. \n  \n The 10th pitch climbs easier, but sustained (5.5) slabs with 1 bolt for pro. \n  \n The 11th pitch (5.0, no pro) skirts a tree island on the left to a tree anchor with lots of slings. \n  \n From here it is possible to continue scrambling up tree ledges, moss grooves and dirty cracks for about 300m of sustained 4th class to the top, or rappel with 2 ropes back down.\n\nHike up the climbers approach trail to the base of Yak and slab climb, smear and scramble left across the base of the crag for 30 minutes to 1 hour to the climb. If you reach a small tarn, you have gone too far; backtrack 100m.\n6 long slings and a light rack of finger sized (medium) nuts and 3-4 finger to hand-sized cams. <br />  <br /> The climb is very runout for the grade (15-20m between bolts on the crux pitches, and easier pitches with no pro whatsoever) and parties should be solid at the grade.

It is consistently 5.8 to 5.9 on the cruxes for most of the pitches, and combines the good rock on the lower pitches of Yak Crack with the quality upper climbing of Reality Check while missing out the hard and runout crux of the latter route.\n\nThere are various ways to start - don't try directly up the lower corner as it blanks out and is hard. One way that works is to solo up corners (5.2) to the ledge and block below Reality Check start then traverse left to the bolt belay at p. 1 of Yak Crack.\n\nP1 - make 5.7ish moves left from the belay up a flake to gain the hand crack on the front face of the flake (small pro). Climb 5.6 crack to a belay out right at bolts near a pinnacle on the arete. ~55m\n\np2 - climb crack to a bolted stance just above trees, belay standing on an impressive krummholz. 5.6 60m rope stretcher. can split this pitch in two at a slung tree half way up.\n\np3 - climb crack to top of pinnacle (Lunch Ledge), belay 10 feet higher at bolts on higher ledge. 35m 5.6\n\np4 - climb sometimes crumbly rock left at first, then up and right (some pro behind flakes and a fixed piton) to a bolted stance. 35 m 5.7. can link 3&amp; 4 with 60m rope and long slings on gear to avoid rope zigzags.\n\np5 - an obvious vertical wall can be climbed via a corner on the left side (5.8) or a series of face holds to a vague hairline crack on the right (5.8+) past a bolt that wasn't placed on the first ascent and first showed up in the mid-2000s, then follow cracks and ramps up and right to a bolted belay 50m\n\np6 - move right from belay and climb a left facing 5.8 corner for about 10m then step right around arete at big hold (can also step right of corner at bottom but you miss out on the cool layback). climb up flakes, pass tree, up to two overlaps at a roofy feature. place gear then move thru overlaps into crumbly, easy groove, climb to bolt belay c. 55m 5.8+ (junction of Yak Crack and Reality Check)\n\np7 - You are now leaving Yak Crack for Reality Check. Climb up 5m from the belay on rock resembling oatmeal, then move left on a solid horizontal dyke until you encounter many flakes. undercling left, then up at end of first flake, climb more flakes to highest undercling at roof. move left (5.9) awkward under roof, to corner \"Cave\". there is a possible belay here under roof on a fixed nut and piton. HOWEVER, despite topos, it is best to go right here on to the arete of the cave and climb up about 10m (5.9 face) to a big ledge with bolted belay on the right. this avoids the spelunking tunnel thru the flake done on the FA which is awkward with a pack on, and avoids belaying on sketchy fixed pin and nut tied off with a single webbing chunk. ~50m 5.9\n\np8 - traverse ledge (top of through-flake) to a bolt belay on left. 30m 3rd class.\n\np9 - climb flake and ramp up and left, then back right a bit for a pitch ~40m 5.8, two bolts once the good crack ennds\n\np10 - supposedly one of the two 10a pitches. face climb up 3m to a bolt, move up and right 3m to another bolt, then back left and up 5m to a corner (bolt on left arete) climb right of the corner up the face on dishes and flakes then move up and right on a nebulous line past more bolts and gear under flakes to a bolted belay on a small right facing corner/ramp (cant see belay until 5m below it). ~45m, easy 5.9 face, total of 5 bolts on the pitch plus gear. Can easily get into 5.10a terrain with lackluster route finding as the most direct line is not the easiest one.\n\np11- climb up flake above belay and either climb directly where it goes right, or move left and up good cracks on the face, to a ledge. above this is a low angle slab with 3 bolts. originally graded 9/10a by the FA party, subsequent ascents have cleaned holds on the slab of lichen making it more secure - now feels like an 5.8/9. belay at bolted stance on ledge above. ~40m 5.8/9 this is where you would rap from if you planned on rappelling. It's **much faster and more enjoyable to walk off than it is to rappel though.**\n\np12 - 4th class up low angle slab (no pro) for full pitch to trees above. 45m 4th class. Can escape into trees lower down to the left if you want to. easiest way off is 10 m traverse hard left to the lowest trees, but there is more bushwacking this way. \n\nFrom here, hike and scramble up towards the top, pass the subsummit on the right side on a good ledge (exposed).\n\nWhen you reach the col between the subsummit of Yak and the main summit, there is a double bolt belay with rap rings which can be used to rappel 50 m down to the meadow, on a waist-high cliffband facing east, on the south side of the col. this rappel is very helpful when there is still snow in the col, and irrelevant once the snow has melted.\n\nYou can rap the route but it is better and faster to walk off down the backside. <br />  <br /> In early season there may be a problematic steep snowpatch blocking the walkoff at the base of the subsummit-true summit col. You can rap past this with two ropes or descend it in approach shoes using a nut tool as an ice axe.\nFull rack to 3\" with doubles to triple cams in the finger size (blue, yellow, orange TCU).

In recent years, the combination of the lower part of Yak Crack with the upper pitches of Reality Check has become the most popular line as it avoids the loose rock and tricky routefinding on upper Yak Crack. \n  \n Follow the obvious diagonal slanting across Yak's southeast face. \n  \n Approach: landmark the massive dihedral that the opening pitches climb near. Do not approach the diheadral directly from below: scramble slabs to the right to a ledge, then traverse hard left to the base of the dihedral and a bolted belay. \n  \n P1-2 original: climb the offwidth dihedral directly. \n P1-2 as climbed now: move left up a small flake from the base of the dihedral to gain a fingercrack over the lip. Follow this for two and a half pitches of 5.6-5.7 to Lunch Ledge. \n  \n P 3-4: from Lunch Ledge, move left to gain the start of the diagonal.
