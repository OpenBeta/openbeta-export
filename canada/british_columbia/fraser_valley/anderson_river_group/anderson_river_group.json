Access may change as unmaintained roads wash out or become overgrown. The peaks are relatively low elevation and come into season early, but remoteness and commitment ensure they are absolutely alpine. Beautiful options for high bivies abound.  \n  \n Les Cornes is the most well-traveled peak out there, though technically just a subsummit of Chamois Peak. Steinbok has one of the most impressive walls in the range, with two routes that are supposedly dirty and scary. Ibex Peak has moderate rock routes. Most things out there are seldom climbed, but there are a handful of high quality modern routes recently developed on Les Cornes. \n  \n I found the current road access quite different from any other online description or guidebook, my main incentive for posting this here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413fb9ff0cf0083295e8069","prevHistoryId":"6413fb9bf0cf0083295e8030","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:32:53.424Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:18.779Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
