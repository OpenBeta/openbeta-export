Two starts were done. Either climb along the arch from left to right (5.7) or climb directly up to the midpoint of the arch from below (5.8, no pro), in both cases reaching a stance belay. Continue right along the arch for a full ropelength (5.8) to a ledge belay. Continue straight up for a full pitch featuring a left-facing slim flake (5.8).
