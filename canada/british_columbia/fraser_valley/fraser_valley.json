The climbing in the area is mostly single pitch trad routes and bolted sport routes. There are also several major and popular mountains in this area (i.e. Mt. Slesse, Rexford, and the Cheam Range). The Rock can vary from solid granite to limestone and, unfortunately, some very loose and flaky volcanic rock (mostly in the Cheam Range)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641401f1f0cf0083295ecaf7","prevHistoryId":"641401e7f0cf0083295eca8c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":47,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:32:47.101Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:32:48.238Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
