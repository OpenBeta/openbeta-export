The pictures were helpful but we found some of the descriptions to be a little terse/vague.\n\nFrom the bivy on the slabs, make your way to the base of the climb, crossing a snow patch. Find a corner system on the right side of the base (we started to the right of Rich So and partner Nick). The rock is good but down low as well as elsewhere, we found we had to clean out cracks for pro, using our nut tools. Most cracks were sealed with dirt and moss.\n\nA few pitches trending upwards and leftward put us under a bulge. We chose to climb up and through a wider looking crack through this bulge section, finding that it didn't really climb or protect wide. Towards the top we exited to the left into more face climbing, trending to the dihedral feature McLane mentions (tallying up another few pitches here). For scale, the dihedral pitch is about one rope length, as is the traverse left under the \"roof\" - a lighter rock that is like an inverted scoop - to the right of the cave.  \n\nAt this point you're about 8 or 9 pitches in. From here, some face wandering (keep an eye out for a piton) for another 6ish pitches finally spits you on top, amongst large blocks. We felt we'd climbed up to about 5.10b in difficulty, despite the official grade. We found gear placements for anchors, but were glad to have a double rack for options, as well as for simuling.  Long slings for slinging rocks were useful too. Unlike Californian or Coloradan alpine, this route only gets climbed a couple of times a year, so it can be far less obvious where to go.\n\nFrom the top, head towards Ratney, descending along the ridgeline into the col, and then summitting up through blocks just left of the first major snowpatch, and then head left until you can find blocks to scramble to the top (about an hour, summit to summit).  Again, no cairns or signs to mark the way here.\n\nAt the top of Ratney, skirt the snow, heading northeast towards the rib making up the north end of the basin containing lower Statlu lake. There may be a cairn to indicate where to find the first set of rap tat. Take extra tat to reinforce this, we found most of it to be quite weathered and old. \"A few\" raps turned into something like 5 or 6 60m raps for us to the flatter part of the ridgeline with snow.\n\nFinally, we rapped down to the second southern-facing offshoot from the ridge, landing on a ledge with 2 snowpatches, and finally a final rappel from a tree put us down on the slabs (about 8 raps total). From here we crossed snow and wet slabs back to the bivy (an hour or so).\n\n\n\nFind your way to the camping on the north end of Chehalis lake, making note of the landslide a few years ago on the western shore and taking the road that comes up and in from Harrison lake rather than the route described in Alpine Select. Past the Chehalis lake camping turnoff, keep going until you hit a huge water bar, and park on the shoulder. Hike along the road, crossing a creek on a really sketchy old rotten wood bridge, or rock hop. \n\nAt some flagging/a cairn, turn left onto the trail to lower Statlu lake. It takes about 45min to get to the lake, just past the top of the waterfalls.  Nice campsites here. Then another hour or two to walk around the lake, stopping for a swim along the way if you have time - it's really lovely. Pass the turnoff at right to go to upper Statlu lake and the Viennese Clark traverse (large wooden sign on a tree at the fork). Stay left to continue on. \n\nOnce you round the end of the beach the trails start diverging and disappearing. Thus begins the bushwhacking section. We veered due west towards the talus slopes on the far side of the creek until we picked up a faint trail, and followed that through mixed sections of talus and bushwhacking, heading north towards Bardean and Ratney, similar to the trail drawn on McLane's picture. \n\nFinally, a final bushwhack spat us into the runoff burm that is the toe of the feature you need to ascend to get to the bivy slabs/bench. This was probably another couple of hours past the end of the lake.  Follow this slash up towards a slot canyon with snow, deking up to the dirt shoulder at right, as the canyon narrows. More bushwhacking leads to the base of a face, which perhaps could be circumvented at left or right, but we roped up and climbed it in one short pitch, onto another bushy ledge.  From here, make your way past snow on slabs with water tri king everywhere until you get to the base of the climb, and bivy (a final couple hours, for a 6-9 hour approach from the car).\n\nStandard single or double rack to 3\", nuts.

While the majority of the route is ridge scrambling there are several short technical sections that benefit from the use of a rack and rope. The V-C weighs in at 4km of distance with 1200 meters of gain in a stunningly exposed alpine playground. \n  \n Access the col east of peak 6500 from either Nursery Pass or from upper Statlu Lake. Scramble up and over the top of peak 6500 and head west towards the East Ridge of Viennese.  \n  \n Climb the east ridge of Viennese towards the summit via a combination of 4th and easy 5th class climbing. Near the top there are two options: the ridge can be climbed directly at 5.9, or you can traverse a slab to the south until a notch is found that contains a short steep corner (5.8) to the top.  \n  \n From the Viennese summit, rappel 40m down the southwest face to a horizontal break. From here scramble down to a notch in the main crest and cross the notch staying high. Continue along the ridgeline on 3rd/4th class scrambling to the Viennese-Recourse col, then up the east ridge of Recourse. Difficult sections can usually be avoided by traversing left.  \n  \n From the top of Recourse, continue west along the ridgeline until you reach a steep downclimb to the Recourse-Clarke col. From the col, mid-5th class climbing up blocky terrain leads up the summit ridge of Clarke. \n  \n From the Clarke summit there are several options for descent: two options bring you back to the Statlu Lake approach. Option 1 is to descend the southeast Ridge of Clarke. The other, more aesthetic option, is descend the northwest ridge to access the basin in-between the northwest and southwest ridges, then circle east back below the summit towards upper Statlu Lake.  \n  \n If you approach the climb from Nursery Pass, you can also descend the northwest ridge and follow it first to a basin north of the ridge, then to a steep heather slope that leads back to the glaciers beneath the North face of Clarke. At times the heather can be quite steep and exposed - we ended up rappelling twice (once off a tree, then off a horn) to reach terra firma. Once on the glaciers and slabs below the route, one can traverse back towards nursery pass \n  \n From Nursery Pass, we completed the route in 16 hours round trip, but your mileage may vary depending on your comfort level soloing easy terrain.\n\nLight alpine rack, single rope (we brought a second rappel line that came in handy but may not be necessary).
