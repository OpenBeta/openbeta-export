An attempt on this line in December 2016 found thin ice and unconsolidated avalanche debris on the first two pitches. During the first ascent a few weeks later, they were fat and easy: 100 m WI2 to a good ledge in the corner. The next pitch continues up the slabs and overcomes some steeper bulges to enter the chimney, 55m WI3. The crux pitch climbs a short steep pillar (may be significantly wet depending on how much water is being spit out by the cobra) and then skirts around the flaring “cobra hood” ice roof on the left via thin ice to reach a good ledge above, 65 m WI4. A final WI2 and snow ramp leads to the top (40m). \n\nOn the FA, Marc-Andre had soloed Mousetrap in the morning and then came to meet us on the climb. He cruised up the crux just behind us, and took off up the last pitch ahead of us.\n\n\n\nWalk along the north bank of the slough if frozen about 500 m past Tailwind; SC is about 60 m left of Tradewinds. You can also approach directly across the slough from Syexw Choleqw Adventure Park if the ice is thick enough. Bash up the boulderfield for 30 minutes to get to the base. \n\nThe walk-off is faster than the rappel. About 4 raps down (maybe 3 with 70 m ropes and good choice of anchors), plus downclimbing. Three of the four on the FA party rapped the route on the slabs to the left and had one scary rappel off a small tree. The second ascent party got their ropes frozen into the ice and said it wasn't fun reclimbing the crux to free them up!\n\nA couple of nuts or Tricams can be used to supplement belays, particularly on the slabs at the base,but are not otherwise necessary"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ctY6Z6n6XnC18NHPqEdmVQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.59755,49.36154]}},"createdBy":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","_change":{"user":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","historyId":"6413fcb7f0cf0083295e8cf2","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:37:59.953Z"},{"_id":"v6W4GdE3RH2Ce4Vq8bieew==","name":"Tailwind","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"to roof only: Gord Menzies, Don Serl Scott Young 1979.
