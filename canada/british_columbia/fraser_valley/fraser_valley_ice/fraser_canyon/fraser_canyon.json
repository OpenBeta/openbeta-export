Once you're a pitch or two off the deck, you'll lose sight of the highway and only have the river below you.\n\nThe first pitch is the mellow crux and is usually the fattest. 35m.\n\nNext climb another 35m consisting of two WI2ish steps.\n\nThen take your pick of either of two rambly WI2-3 pitches. The left parallels an overhanging granite cliff and stays free of snow. You can run these for almost 60m if you want. Both continue up into the forest via easy rambling with possible steeper steps, generally petering out after another 70m or less.\n\nDescend the route on threads. Two 60s make this easiest, but a single 70 will still get you down with an extra v-thread or two. Descending through the trees climbers right (above the Ridder and Mr. Freeze) may be possible.\n\nThe route is immediately on your left after driving through the Sailor Bar tunnel (signed) if coming from Hope. Park in the pullout to the right, directly across from the route. Hard to miss.<br /><br />If it's snowing and plows are running, there's a larger pullout on the left another 500m north.\nscrews. shorter screws often work a little better in the sometimes finicky west coast ice."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"BGRD3RPTWdeeISSFzjN1wA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.41726,49.57071]}},"createdBy":"EQro+hNEWKi1gqmT1mXCRA==","_change":{"user":"EQro+hNEWKi1gqmT1mXCRA==","historyId":"6413fcadf0cf0083295e8c85","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:37:49.545Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,55e34f67-cad5-5352-bfdc-7974184c8abd,e9f3ae26-3214-533d-9fcc-acede63e1733,046443dd-13d3-59d7-9e21-2485ce3375c0","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Fraser Valley","Fraser Valley Ice","Fraser Canyon"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.41726,49.57071]},"bbox":[-121.41795337526332,49.570260339818134,-121.4165666247367,49.57115966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"BGRD3RPTWdeeISSFzjN1wA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.41795337526332,49.570260339818134],[-121.4165666247367,49.570260339818134],[-121.4165666247367,49.57115966018186],[-121.41795337526332,49.57115966018186],[-121.41795337526332,49.570260339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"Highway 1 between Hope and Lytton winds through the beautiful Fraser River Canyon.
