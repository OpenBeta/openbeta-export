There is a long bouldering traverse, a number of straight-up problems, and a bunch of new sport climbing as of 2020. The bouldering is overhanging, pocketed, with a soft sandy landing, and stays dry in the rain. The limestone is waterworn and solid. Downsides include a shady, sometimes mossy ambiance and the presence of a fishermen's parking lot close by - they come into the seclusion of the trees to crap before/after fishing and leave turd piles behind.
