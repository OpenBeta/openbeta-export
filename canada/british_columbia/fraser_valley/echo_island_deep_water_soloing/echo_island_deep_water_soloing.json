A 2km stretch of cliffs and outcrops that overlook Harrison Hot Springs. The depth ranges from 30' to 85' deep. Most of the climbing is slightly overhung to extremely steep. Some of the climbs can reach 80'to 100' high with big roofs and potential for some multi pitch sport climbs. This area will keep climbers busy for years with FA's. The established climbs have 1/4 inch bolts to clip the boat."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413fc2af0cf0083295e8698","prevHistoryId":"6413fc28f0cf0083295e8692","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:35:34.158Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:35:38.081Z","updatedBy":"T9mf4mvAXCmT++V4+1kgFg=="}
