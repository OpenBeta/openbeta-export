It takes a prominent, clean right-facing dihedral through a roof, with thin moves (hook and knifeblade) to start then widening cracks with good cam placements. Above the roof, the crack widens, becoming a mossy offwidth with some mandatory free-climbing (5.8, #4 Camalots). At a ledge about 5m below the mossy slabby cliff top, the route finishes at a bolted anchor. The bolts used on the FA were the wrong size for the drill bit and are only half-driven in their holes, resulting in a slightly-more-than-bodyweight rap anchor that requires replacement. \n  \n A little bit of cleaning and an anchor upgrade should see this route go free around 5.10+.\n\nWalk the road east from the pipeline for 2 minutes and look uphill to see the prominent dihedral.  <br />  <br /> Scary, dangerous rap - be prepared to replace the rappel anchor bolts if doing the 2nd ascent of this line, or push it through to the dirty topout on the cliff.\nOne knifeblade, Talon hook, nuts and cams to 4\"."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"tXEj7WB2ViqrgI9T1hgohQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.5042,49.3767]}},"createdBy":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","_change":{"user":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","historyId":"6413ffc0f0cf0083295eb2d2","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:50:56.889Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,55e34f67-cad5-5352-bfdc-7974184c8abd,b57123ed-6076-562a-ab80-8f53d6182885","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Fraser Valley","Orange Pipeline Crags"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.5042,49.3767]},"bbox":[-121.50489063426657,49.37625033981814,-121.50350936573342,49.37714966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"tXEj7WB2ViqrgI9T1hgohQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.50489063426657,49.37625033981814],[-121.50350936573342,49.37625033981814],[-121.50350936573342,49.37714966018186],[-121.50489063426657,49.37714966018186],[-121.50489063426657,49.37625033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Located at the north end of the orange gas pipeline that spans the Fraser, off Highway 7(across the Fraser from Flood Falls).
