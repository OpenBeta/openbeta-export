Large house size boulders with scoops, pockets, edges, and pinches. You won't find as many slopers or slabs as compared to the other areas... the climbing is steep and burly. \n  \n The two main areas, The Happies (AKA The Shipwreck Boulders)and Hotel Boulders (AKA the Cave Boulders) will soon be connected by a trail. There are boulders scattered throughout the forest between these areas. Around a 10 min. hike will separate both areas. \n  \n Because of the size and steepness of the boulders, you will find some garbage from past squatters. A clean-up is in effect."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413fc19f0cf0083295e85f0","prevHistoryId":"6413fc15f0cf0083295e85d5","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":12,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:34:22.202Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:34:24.059Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
