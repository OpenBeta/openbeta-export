Horsey ride your way along the au cheval to its north end (giddy-up) and a webbing anchor. Make a 25 m rappel into the North-South notch. Now climb three pitches out of the north up the north ridge of South Illusion Peak. The first pitch is about 5.7. The second short pitch is typically the crux with a short bit of 5.9 climbing featuing small nuts and small cams. Gain a spacious belay ledge at a protruding finger of rock and climb a right-diagonalling long pitch of 5.6 to the South Illusion summit ridge. \n\nDick Culbert asserted that you can also climb a bushy 4th class fault system slightly further south to bypass the first two pitches but it looks like a godawful thrash.\n\nNote that in 1993, Kobus Barnard, John Black and Emily Butler started the Nesakwatch Enchainment by climbing Disillusion Peak, then this, then continuing south all the way to Rexford's south Peak and Pi Pillar.\n\n\n\nBetween North and South Illusion Peaks\n\nSmall rack to 3\" including rappel webbing to beef up existing anchors."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"TS7dBibXUOOIyIozv4rYCg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.54112,49.04282]}},"createdBy":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","_change":{"user":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","historyId":"64140204f0cf0083295ecb9c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:00:36.849Z"},{"_id":"zwmgdaTXSLiOUBXwiAoHlw==","name":"South Ridge","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"most likely by Tselxweyeqw goat hunters","length":606,"content":{"description":"\nOne of the best scrambles in the Rexford Group, and can be done easily either as a long day trip from cars or a short daytrip from a camp in the basin below Mount Rexford and South Nesakwatch Spire. \n\nFollow the Nesakwatch and Rexford trail to the alpine talus bowl below and northwest of North Nesakwatch Spire.
