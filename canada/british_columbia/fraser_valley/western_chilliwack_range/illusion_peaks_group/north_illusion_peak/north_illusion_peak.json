If you plan on returning the way you came, you'll need to repeat the traverse in the opposite direction (North to South) to get off as described for North Illusion Peak.\n\nFrom the summit of South Illusion Peak, descend slightly north to a viewpoint above the North-South gap and find a suitable rappel anchor (you may find webbing in place).\n\nMake two long or three short rappels into the North-South col. Note that it's easy to get your rope stuck behind a flake! If using two ropes, this isn't so bad as you can continue with one and grab the stuck rope on your way back).\n\nFrom the NS Col, circle around the toe of the steep wall on North Illusion's south ridge to the left (west) and scramble up to a ledge.\n\nOff the ledge, climb a half pitch of black-lichened cracks and slabs to reach the spectacular au cheval ridge. Giddyup along the ridge to its south end and a belay. Scramble easily the rest of the way up to North Illusion.\n\n\n\nThe ridge and gap between the two Illusion Peaks.\n\nSmall rack to 3\""},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"rNcEjAUWVoaHAaY7fLMbUQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.54421,49.04488]}},"createdBy":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","_change":{"user":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg==","historyId":"64140200f0cf0083295ecb81","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:00:32.793Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,55e34f67-cad5-5352-bfdc-7974184c8abd,6665488f-e66c-510d-8a40-9065b9a93f40,25cc080b-939f-5a8c-8da5-27f4937de31a,acd7048c-0516-5686-8701-a63b7cb31b51","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Fraser Valley","Western Chilliwack Range","Illusion Peaks Group","North Illusion Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.54421,49.04488]},"bbox":[-121.54489601428975,49.044430339818135,-121.54352398571028,49.04532966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"rNcEjAUWVoaHAaY7fLMbUQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.54489601428975,49.044430339818135],[-121.54352398571028,49.044430339818135],[-121.54352398571028,49.04532966018186],[-121.54489601428975,49.04532966018186],[-121.54489601428975,49.044430339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"The northernmost, and slightly lower, of the two Illusion Peaks"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140200f0cf0083295ecb81","prevHistoryId":"641401fff0cf0083295ecb7b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:00:30.607Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:40.916Z","updatedBy":"nX7EbpE+VmGbepshkrcSkg=="}
