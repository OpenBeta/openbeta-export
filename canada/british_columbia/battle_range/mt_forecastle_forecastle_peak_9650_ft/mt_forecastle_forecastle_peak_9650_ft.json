FA of Mtn was apparently made in 1970 via the East Ridge, gaining the ridge from the Typee-Forecastle col and climbing \"delightful slabs\". The Northwest ridge was descended in 1974 to get to Peguod. \n\nHow such an obvious ridge was (supposedly unclimbed) as late as 1995 tells you how infrequently this area is visited. \n\nMemory is a bit hazy, but I believe we slabbed across the far south end of the ridge and gained the ridge proper from its East side. The climbing was pleasant and views outstanding. I don't recall belaying, and the photo of us climbing one of the steeper pitches doesn't seem to show a rope, but I can't believe we didn't take one along.\n\nWe would have descended the same route.  \n\n\n\nEast of Houston Lake Camp. \n\nRope \"in case\", \"Alpine\" sparse selection of gear - I'd guess larger stuff."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"L25LQbz3U0avPxBqoSeVjg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.39378,50.95724]}},"createdBy":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","_change":{"user":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","historyId":"64134a88f0cf0083295dbbca","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:57:44.435Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,55275634-71cc-5b9d-aaff-6783e0ee0690,2f6e4b41-bcf7-5346-af3f-106aa127958e","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Battle Range","Mt Forecastle (\"Forecastle Peak\") 9650 ft"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.39378,50.95724]},"bbox":[-117.39449385940259,50.95679033981815,-117.39306614059741,50.95768966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"L25LQbz3U0avPxBqoSeVjg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.39449385940259,50.95679033981815],[-117.39306614059741,50.95679033981815],[-117.39306614059741,50.95768966018187],[-117.39449385940259,50.95768966018187],[-117.39449385940259,50.95679033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"Looking up towards the north, with your back to Houston Lake, this peak's south ridge (together with Mt Pequod - 9750 ft) forms the right side of the glacial basin of Mt Moby Dick that drains into Houston Lake / Creek.\n\nDo not confuse with Mt Foremast (8810 ft, 2865m )\n\n\nLooking up towards the north, with your back to Houston Lake, this peak's south ridge (together with Mt Pequod - 9750 ft) forms the right side of the glacial basin of Mt Moby Dick that drains into Houston Lake / Creek.\n\nDo not confuse with Mt Foremast (8810 ft, 2865m )"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","historyId":"6413fa59f0cf0083295e7305","prevHistoryId":"64134a88f0cf0083295dbbca","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:57:42.216Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:41.887Z","updatedBy":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A=="}
