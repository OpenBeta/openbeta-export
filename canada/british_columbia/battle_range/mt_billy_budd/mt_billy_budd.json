Not that it was THAT bad for alpine rock, but with so much higher quality rock around, why waste time on \"this\"? \n\nRoute: From the west end of Houston Lake climb up and through snow and whatever is now left of two small (in 1995) glaciers that occupy the north-facing cirque between Bully Budd and Claggart. \n\nSomewhere near where there would be the minimum of rock to climb we left the glacier/snow and climbed rock.  Pretty typical alpine, fractured rock.  Big blocks, sandy ledges Sheila took a belay, I think others did too. Easy Grade 5 (5.2 ...5.5 ??) \n\nI do NOT believe we descended the route, but have no recollection of how we got back to camp. ??Maybe on Claggart's west ridge to the high col west of Houston Lake and then down to camp???\n\n\n\nA bit Southwest of Houston Lake \n\nHard Hats. usual gear.
