I didn't mark a route up the Beaver Glacier because it is not used regularly.     \n  \n The ascent of the north ridge began from a camp on the pass northeast of  Mount Butters (see map).  First, a fine snow ridge is followed to a sub-summit.  \"Thence descend south on rock and follow mixed rock and snow ridge which blends into N ridge.

I'm not sure if the tension traverse and chimney are the inferred crux.  But when Yosemite climbers, who have off-widths in Chamonix named after them, call a chimney difficult, then 50+ years of technological advancement may not make the route much easier today.  So I suggest panicking: Bring the Half Dome rack! <br />  <br /> For the descent, there might be better things to leave as anchors than your expensive cams.  For example, some knotted slings, instead of sewn."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"v1QUCYa4Xi+IYECQscrHwA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.41805,50.95635]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"64134a7af0cf0083295dbb4a","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:57:30.244Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,55275634-71cc-5b9d-aaff-6783e0ee0690,bf541409-86b8-5e2f-8860-4090b1cac7c0","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Battle Range","Mount Butters"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.41805,50.95635]},"bbox":[-117.41876384573042,50.95590033981813,-117.41733615426958,50.956799660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"v1QUCYa4Xi+IYECQscrHwA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.41876384573042,50.95590033981813],[-117.41733615426958,50.95590033981813],[-117.41733615426958,50.956799660181865],[-117.41876384573042,50.956799660181865],[-117.41876384573042,50.95590033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"INTRODUCTION \n  \n Mount Butters is the furthest north of the good rock climbing in the Battle Range.  First climbed in 1914, from Butters Lake via the east glacier and ridge.   \n  \n The route that looks most interesting for alpinists is the 1958 Stanford Route by DeStaebler-Harlin-Hemming-Kendall, up the north ridge. History buffs may recognize that among these names are the first Yosemite trained Americans to actually impress the Europeans with their tick-list. \n  \n Fred Beckey, Steve Drake, and Ronald Van Horsen climbed the west face and south ridges from a (presumed) chopper landing at the col south of Butters; Pequod Pass.  They also climbed on the north side of Moby Dick from camp at the pass.  \n  \n APPROACH \n  \n The shortest way may be to hike up Butters Creek from the end of the Duncan Road.  Peakfinder seems to indicate that the road was washed out dozens of kilometers south.  But it looks good near the termination at the border of Glacier National Park.  If the road is passable, then it is just a gorgeous brush-fight for 8 clicks to Butters Lake.  Might be prudent to have either two cars or bikes to get out in case the break-line loving porcupines eat you car. Satellite phone country for sure.  And chicken wire to encircle your vehicle.   \n  \n For those who prefer to ski, the Selkirk half of the Bugaboo to Rogers Pass route has been used.  This approach does not require dropping into the forests of the Duncan River Trench.  It does require several days to reach a base camp for Mount Butters from Rogers Pass."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6413fa50f0cf0083295e72e5","prevHistoryId":"64134a7af0cf0083295dbb4a","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:57:28.155Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:41.817Z","updatedBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw=="}
