In fact, since one of our members knew Hans personally, I'm not sure that even then it was available to the general public.\n\nWe were \"in\" for two weeks. Quite bad \"mountain weather\", even for the Selkirks. In fact, when one of our party had a medical issue (a re-occurring problem that flaired up) more than half the party took the opportunity to fly out on his Â British-Health-System-Paid-for \"rescue\" 'copter. However, in 1977 in a trip to the Adamants we experienced 13 out of 14 days of spectacular weather, and even on that one day were able to do a nice hike....so, as they say, \"You pays your money and you takes your chances!\"\n\nOn the Battle Range trip the 13 days we were in, the breakdown was something like: 2 days sun, 3-4 days rain part of the day but you could go for a hike part of the day, 7-8 days \"in camp\"."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","historyId":"64134a8af0cf0083295dbbdf","prevHistoryId":"64134a88f0cf0083295dbbd4","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-16T16:57:44.997Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:57:46.237Z","updatedBy":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A=="}
