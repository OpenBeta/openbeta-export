Beckey-Mather on Snowpatch, Rowell-Jones-Quamar on North Howser (1971) and Roskelly-Copynzski? (1971)on Dag Peak in the Valhallas are the only grade sixes done before Ohno Wall. The first ascent party took 4 1/2 days, using 5 bolts.\n\nAPPROACH\n\nMarkel, from Boulder, CO, choppered into a base camp at the headwaters of Butters Creek. Wallace hiked in from the Duncan, presumably via the green hell of Butters Creek. Jones came in via a high route from Glacier Circle Hut. For those who are not chopper-cheats, Butter Creek is easier for getting to the base of the wall. The standard route on Moby Dick descends into the Houston Creek, so this valley might be more useful. But only if the light blue glacier route, marked on the map, is safe.\n\n[Please note that this climb is on the \"north\" side of the mtn, not easily accessed from Houston Lake. R.Hall 2021 ] \n\nROUTE\n\nLocated on the photo.\n\nWet slabs and poor rock slowed progress. Jones was hit and bruised by falling rock. The team scored a hit in a lightning storm. Markel told me, a couple of years later, that it was not his favorite route. Looks like room for more!\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"UpEYsAJ/WHeF51FqjQ2W2w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.413,50.9595]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"64134a7cf0cf0083295dbb65","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:57:33.017Z"},{"_id":"kokGuaMgSrqKI9Nlj34E/w==","name":"South Face Rib","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":true,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"D Anger, F Riley, S Silverstein, 1959","length":1061,"content":{"description":"\nA camp above the Houston Glacier was used.
