Located amongst the climbing routes of 'Ymir Swimming Hole' Crag. The rock is amazing and worth the trip alone.\n\nThere are many fantastic problems that tend to have soft landings and are easy to manage with limited crash pads. Easily enough to keep you busy for a day with a fun swimming spot on the Salmo River spitting distance from the climbing. Bring your trad rack and a rope to round out a fun day!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140998f0cf0083295f2208","prevHistoryId":"64140997f0cf0083295f2202","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:32:53.883Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:47.693Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
