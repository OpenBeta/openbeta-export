Most of the routes are single pitch, but there are a handful up to three pitches long.\n\nThis area was purchased by the non-profit society TAWKROC (The Association of West Kootenay Rock Climbers) in 2016. They maintain it and keep public access open. The 18-acre property boasts 100-metre-high cliffs but is surrounded on 3 sides by suburbia. Therefore it's imperative climbers be respectful of our neighbours:• Park near the base of the trail to Open Book Wall• Sign the waiver every year• Keep noise to a minimum. The base of Kinnaird acts as an amphitheatre and the neighbours hear everything climbers say.• Stay to established trails.• Stay off of private property and out of people’s back yards.• Do not cross the empty lot below Hail Mary Wall. There's a new trail from Yellow Sling Wall• Support TAWKROC by purchasing an annual membership for $10 here"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414068ef0cf0083295efc9d","prevHistoryId":"64140685f0cf0083295efc24","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":10,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:18:40.834Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:18:41.907Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
