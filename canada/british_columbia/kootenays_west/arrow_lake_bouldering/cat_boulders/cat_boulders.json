There are a wide variety of grades and most of the problems tend to be on steep, quality Gneiss involving big moves with good landings. There is certainly potential for more routes here and variations due to the nature of the rock; great holds everywhere! There are also many smaller boulders that have been climbed, but not recorded. A wide variety of wildlife is quite common in these parts including: black bear, wild turkeys, cougars, deer, &amp; big horn sheep, and the forest is especially nice in fall when the larch’s needles change into a spectacular golden color; a truly magnificent little place…."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414042cf0cf0083295ee29c","prevHistoryId":"64140423f0cf0083295ee209","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:09:31.596Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:16.929Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
