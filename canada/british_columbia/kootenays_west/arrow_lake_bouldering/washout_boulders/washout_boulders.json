There seems to be a little something here for everyone’s particular style, not to mention all the awe inspiring lines you will come across: if you climb V4 and above you got to come check it out, I can’t guarantee you wont leave with a big smile on your face :) Amazingly all of the problems start seated (some really low) and feature lots of moves for their height, adding another fun aspect to this zone! Have fun!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414060df0cf0083295ef631","prevHistoryId":"64140608f0cf0083295ef5f8","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:17:36.350Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:11.232Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
