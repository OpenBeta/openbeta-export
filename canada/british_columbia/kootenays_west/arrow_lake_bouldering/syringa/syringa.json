The rock here is made up of a very compact type of Granite/Gneiss thatâ€™s very solid and super sticky and a little different from the rest of Arrow Lake. There is a ton of variety that exists between the different boulders; lots of steep, powerful, technical, committing and natural climbing. The problems here stand amongst some of the best @ Arrow Lake, there are some lines here that would be classic anywhere in the world :)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641405f7f0cf0083295ef54b","prevHistoryId":"641405f2f0cf0083295ef508","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:15:54.296Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:15:55.598Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
