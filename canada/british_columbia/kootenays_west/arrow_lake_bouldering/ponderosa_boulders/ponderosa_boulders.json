These fine boulders lie high above the shores of Arrow Lake amongst an awesome Ponderosa Pine forest with a great approach and amazing scenery. The hike in is the longest of any of the zones around but the problems are certainly worth the walk and the trail brings you through a beautiful zone. The FUKUSHIMA Boulder is a masterpiece, big lines, amazing holds, and some of the most aesthetic boulder problems in the West Kootenay’s, it’s absolutely massive and it’s hosts tons of climbing: a must visit! The PONDEROSA Boulder was the original boulder discovered and it hosts some pretty amazing face climbing on perfect rock and it makes for a great warm-up for the big guy up the hill. :) Needless to say this place is going to leave you with a big smile."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140553f0cf0083295eeeaf","prevHistoryId":"64140543f0cf0083295eedae","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:14:25.488Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:14:26.744Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
