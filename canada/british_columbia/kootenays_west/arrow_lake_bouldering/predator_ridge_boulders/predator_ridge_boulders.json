This area offers many styles of climbing, from technical face to steep overhangs, slopey bulges and big proud faces. When you top out many of the problems you are greeted with an exceptional view of the lake 200m’s below. Take a beautiful hike up and enjoy all this area has to offer! The rock is made up high quality Gneiss but like all the individual areas at Arrow Lake, it climbs a little different. Please be courteous of the ‘Private Property’ nearby and have a great time Bouldering at this unique location."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414057ff0cf0083295ef0c2","prevHistoryId":"64140574f0cf0083295ef043","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:14:51.402Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:16.959Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
