With tons of aesthetic lines, tall proud highballs, beginner friendly low balls and some serious classics, when in season this zone should definitely be on your radar. The rock found here is high quality Gneiss similar to that found on others boulders in the area but there are a few unique blocks adjacent to the water (that get flooded in June/July) that offer up a different style of climbing than the other problems in the region. \n  \n On that note The Atlantis, The Low-Tide &amp; The Beachside Boulderâ€™s are subject to high water and have a shorter season. Fortunately there are many more problems in the area that have recently opened up to keep you busy for those two months the lake is full that are all high quality. Have fun and keep exploring, there is lots of potential for variations, especially down on the lake."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140416f0cf0083295ee17c","prevHistoryId":"6414040ff0cf0083295ee125","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:08:48.406Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:16.920Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
