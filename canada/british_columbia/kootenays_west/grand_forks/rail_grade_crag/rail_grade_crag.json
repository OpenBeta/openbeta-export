Chill slabby routes. Close  \n to beaches. Ideal hammock trees and sun tanning  \n rocks. What’s there not to like? This whole crag is a  \n 10-15m rock cut on the old Columbia and Western  \n Railway which is now part of the Trans Canada Trail.  \n The super civilized approach cuts down on the ticks  \n and poison ivy that plague some of the other Gilpin  \n crags. If you don’t feel like leading, the top of the  \n routes are easily accessible by scrambling climbers  \n right. It’s the most convenient beginners’ crag in the  \n area. It faces south but trees shade it in the evening  \n so it isn’t as scorchingly hot as some of the other  \n south facing Gilpin crags. Make sure to keep your  \n gear off the rail trail because it gets a fair amount of  \n bike traffic."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"aS/E2uS2Ud+x/XNZqGxcUQ==","historyId":"64140762f0cf0083295f0798","prevHistoryId":"64140761f0cf0083295f078d","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:23:29.416Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:16.265Z","updatedBy":"aS/E2uS2Ud+x/XNZqGxcUQ=="}
