These days Bill Sperling is the #1 on Grand Forks climbing knowledge and route development. According to him \"Grand Forks has a climate similar to Skaha Bluffs. In particular, the crags in Gilpin Grasslands Provincial Park can be climbed all year round if it gets above freezing and is sunny. Generally the 4 Gilpin Crags are good from March to June then get too hot to climb in July and August. These crags are also a great place to learn how to identify poison ivy. If you are not acquainted with it already, then you soon will be. In the summer the coolest crag is Cascade Gorge. The best crags to visit overall are Cascade Gorge and Lynch Bluffs. The majority of routes in the area are 5.10 or easier with a lot of beginner friendly shorter sport routes\""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140761f0cf0083295f078d","prevHistoryId":"64140754f0cf0083295f06c8","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:22:27.924Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:19.169Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
