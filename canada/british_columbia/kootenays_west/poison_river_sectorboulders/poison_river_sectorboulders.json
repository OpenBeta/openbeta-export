The setting is grand, located near the Slocan River, this area offers many fine views, and the climbing is set amongst some big cedars that offer up a nice amount of shade. The rock here is made up of a very unique type of Gneiss, abound with tons of cool features and interesting pockets. Steep, powerful climbing is the main focus here but there are a few other cool problems/projects around as well, most of the climbing falls in the V2-V9 range. If awesome, aesthetic, steep bouldering is your thing; this place should be on your must-visit list!! There are also tons of quality post-climbing swimming holes, just take a walk down the rail-trail to one of the many small beaches! Have funâ€¦."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414091df0cf0083295f1c7e","prevHistoryId":"64140917f0cf0083295f1c59","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:30:33.434Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:30:35.383Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
