Climb up another long easy pitch (5.7) to the base of a steep left-facing corner. Awesome laybacking, finger jamming Â and stemming up the corner (5.9 or 10a, *****) leads to a traverse left to belay. One more easy pitch (5.6) leads to the top out on the upper west ridge just below the summit tower.\n\n\n\nSee TOPO. Right side of SW face.\n\nNice to have doubles from finger size to fists.
