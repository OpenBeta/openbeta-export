Three children and a sitter came in by chopper. This route was attempted, and Peter Koedt, Peter Rowat, Nona Rowat, and Greg Shannan did the first two pitches before weather forced a retreat. That September, Peter Koedt and James Hamlin returned to finish the ridge.\n\n              \n         MOUNT GIMLI'S SOUTH RIDGE      \n\n\nPeter Rowat and company made the first one day ascent of Mt Gimli's South Ridge during the early seventies. What follows is Peter Rowat's route description from the Kootney Karabiner, Volume 16, 1973:\n\n\"...The climb takes the crest of the ridge all the way. 1 The most southerly point of Gimli, the start of the ridge and hardest pitch of the climb, consists of a curvaceous jam crack at the back of a 120 ft high steep wide chimney capped by an overhang. Can be well protected with nuts and exits right at the top to a stance beside the overhang. 2 Go straight up 6 feet then back left onto the ridge crest and climb easier ground to the first notch. 3 Go up to obvious flake, aim for the obvious crack but traverse round corner to right. 4 Continue to big flat step. 5 Continuous 5.6 for 200 ft going right occasionally, to stance. 6 Continue up circumventing overhang on left. 7-10 Ridge rounds off gradually, scramble to top. Rating: 5.7. Gear: 6 pins from small horizontal to 1 1/2\", 12 nuts.\"\n\n              \n         GIMLI SOUTH RIDGE       \n\n\n\n\nHigh quality gneiss is climbed directly up the fin shaped southeast ridge of Mount Gimli. Since we use the Yosemite Decimal System, I like to use Valley routes for comparison. My crack-hating wife thought the crux first pitch to be much harder than Bishop's Jamcrack (5.8) and much easier than pitch two of the Central Pillar of Frenzy (5.9).\n\nStart climbing left of the pack-stash ledge, up delicate but easy slabs, 20 feet left of the main crack system. Climb the excellent white corner passing a roof with good holds and strenuous pulls out right. 35 meters up, there are about ten slings, with rings, around a flake for a rappel anchor. Better to belay on the ledge a few feet above the slings. Anchor in the main crack on the left. Beware of the hollow horizontal crack that appears to anchor the better part of the ledge.\n\nThe second pitch climbs up to the ridge using thin cracks and dark gneiss band holds. About 5.7 to start, then easing up to a notch/Gendarme belay with a slung chockstone.\n\nPitch three climbs more gorgeous, steep, and tricky banded gneiss. End at a tree and nice ledge on the ridge (5.7, see photo).\n\nPitch four is again steep and beautiful, with a hard lieback move. End atop the grassy and comfortable \"Lunch Ledge\" (5.6+, 60 meters).\n\nPitch five is again fun and exposed for 60 meters to the base of the notorious roof pitch (5.8).\n\nPitch six starts with a short corner up the the roof move. Left around the roof up to a small ledge (5.10a move).\n\nPitch seven is the last of the fifth class climbing. Two hundred feet, with more nicely sculpted rock, up to a belay below the \"diving board\" (5.7).\n\nA long stretch of class III ridge leads to Mount Gimli's sub-summit, then a notch, and finally a class II scramble to the true summit.

Rock climbers might agree. \n  \n Mount Gimli was first climbed in 1963 by Mrs H Butling, R Deane, M Stewart, and P Williams via the East Ridge (Putnam, 1971, \"Gimli Peak...no rope required\").  \n  \n APPROACH \n It is fortuitous that the most beautiful of the Valhalla Mountains requires the shortest approach hike.  Begin with 15 miles of logging road, usually okay for any car with a stout-hearted driver.  Then a steep, but well groomed, trail climbs about 3 miles to the toe of Mt Gimli's South Ridge. \n                        Approach from Slocan, British Columbia       \n MT GIMLI ROUTE SUMMARY \n                        GIMLI'S EAST SIDE       \n                        WEST FACE ROUTES       \n                        WEST FACE-LEFT SIDE       \n  \n DESCENT \n                        GIMLI DESCENTS       \n From the true summit, descend the East Ridge via steep class III downclimbing.  The crux is at the top. Down low, a barrier cliff prevents easily returning to gear stashed at the base.  If you carry your hiking shoes and packs up the route, then it should be possible to rejoin the trail near the bivouac (Green). \n  \n The local guide book describes a short-cut to the base of the SE Ridge route:  \"Two 60-meter rappels will deliver you back to the start of the South Ridge (Kristiansen &amp; Hempsall, 2009).\" (Black)  \n  \n I have observed both mountain goats and people using an even better shortcut to Gimli's East Ridge, passing right by the first belay on the South Ridge.  This is probably worth a try.  Maybe one short rappel at the crux (blue).   \n                        GOAT TRAIL"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140981f0cf0083295f211d","prevHistoryId":"64140981f0cf0083295f2113","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":12,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:32:26.781Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:58.715Z","updatedBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw=="}
