This could be lower if there was still snow at the base. Continue up to a second bolt situated on the left side of the arch. Climb flakes trending left then up to a ledge system above the arch with 2 very small trees. Climb up trending right via slabs and right facing flakes past another bolt to a 2-bolt anchor.\n P2. 55m, 5.8, 4 bolt, 2 pitons &amp; gear. Climb up to a piton then right of overhang along a right trending crack. Step left to a piton then up the slab more directly past 4 bolts via flakes and undercling to a narrow stance and 2-bolt anchor. \nP3. 58m, 5.8, 3 bolt &amp; gear. Climb up a tad to the left past 1 bolt then a tad to the right past another bolt. Continue up nice flakes and undercling with adequate gear and a final bolt.

Start by passing an overlap on its right then up via slabby section with flake features. Belay at 2-bolt anchor (difficult to see) located on the underside of an overlap. \nP5. 50m, 5.8, 3 bolt &amp; gear. Step left a few meters then up trending left for 15m. Continue more directly passing 3 bolts on slab then a corner weakness to easier slab section. Climb the left side of a final overlap then trend right to a sloping ledge and 2-bolt anchor.\nP6. 55m, 5.1 to 4th class, 1 bolt. Climb up easier slabs passing 1 bolt just right of a shallow grassy gully to a 2-bolt anchor on a block at the top of the slab. From here, continue up steep grassy slopes to a large meadow and follow the Slabadabado descent. You can alternatively rappel the route with 2x60m ropes.\n\nApproach info: As for Slabadabado; Turn off Highway 6 at either Passmore or Slocan City. Follow signs on gravel road for about 44 kilometres (27 mi). The final 2km of road may be rough. Fires and pets are not allowed. The Drinnan Pass trailhead elevation is at 1,615 metres (5,329 ft). It is approximately 2 hrs from Nelson or 1hr from Slocan City. From the trailhead, follow the Drinnan Pass trail for about 1.5km. After walking up for 30-35minutes the trail will emerge into a large open talus field. Continue along the trail and cross the talus field below Drinnan Slab. At the far side of the talus field, the trail crosses a seasonal stream directly below the lowest part of Drinnan Slab. From here, scramble up and left for 20m. The route starts from a wide sloping ledge 10m above the bottom of the slab. It is a 30-35-minute approach.<br /><br /> Descent Info: It is possible to rappel the route with 2 ropes however, the walk off is straightforward and recommended. From the flat grassy bench above Drinnan Slab, walk in a Northerly direction towards Drinnan Lake. From the northern edge of the bench, there are two parallel gullies leading steeply towards Drinnan Lake. The left (West) gully cliffs out partially down and is not recommended. Take the narrower right-hand gully (East of the 1st one) and head down in a Northerly direction toward the right hand side of a large talus field. Cross the talus field and follow open glades towards the mount of Drinnan Lake. From Drinnan Lake, follow the Drinnan Pass trail downhill back to the Trailhead. 1 to 1.5hrs.\n: 1 set from 0.2” to 3”, double in the 0.2” to 0.5”, 1 to 2 60m ropes"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"n5RfI+noUWCPHyUtuqs64w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.74943,49.78399]}},"createdBy":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","_change":{"user":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","historyId":"64140971f0cf0083295f204a","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:32:17.280Z"},{"_id":"ybW5izkYT4qSU07xZ/+gDw==","name":"Slabadabadoo","grades":{"yds":"5.7"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"D.
