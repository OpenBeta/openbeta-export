A more fitting name would be The Fairview Bluffs. A collection of discontinuous granite slabs and walls. The area goes through phases of mossy and clean depending on the amount of attention it has received. As of Fall 2020 several of the original plus some new routes have been cleaned. Most climbs are in the easy to moderate range with a few difficult sport and trad routes. Beautiful views of town and a west facing aspect make this a great place to watch the sun go down.
