These efforts resulted in the creation of several 2-4 pitch climbs scattered over various rock walls between Half Dome and Ymir Peak.\n\nIn total, 11 mixed bolted &amp; trad pitches ranging from 5.5 to 5.10a were created. All pitches, 30m or less in length, have bolted belays and can be rappelled with a single 60m rope. The climbing is interesting and varied however, the quality of the rock and routes does not warrant a classic mention. That being said it provides a unique mountain experience with fun easy climbing and great views close to Nelson. Each individual sections are interesting on their own, linking multiple sections together as part of a day trip increases the quality of the experience.\n\nThe names used for the various climbs were inspired by the famous Whitewater Cookbooks written by Shelly Addams. An ascent of all sections from left to right (including the Salad climbs) combined with ascents of Half Dome &amp; Ymir Peak makes for a fun full day in the hills (referred to as “The Full Meal Deal”). Enjoy and remember to eat your greens: your mom would be proud!\n\nFull Report:  summitmountainguides.com/bl…"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140905f0cf0083295f1b90","prevHistoryId":"641408fff0cf0083295f1b73","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:30:15.056Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:30:16.127Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
