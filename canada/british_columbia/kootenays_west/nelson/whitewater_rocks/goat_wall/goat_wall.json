Locate the 1st bolt and climb up a featured slab towards a second bolt. Gain the loose slanting ledge and two bolt anchor above.\n\nP2. 20m, 5.5, 3 bolts. Climb featured slabs up &amp; right 8m to the first bolt and then up &amp; left past 2 more bolts to a two bolt anchor at a small ledge. P1 &amp; P2 can be combined.\n\nP3. 29m, 5.8, 6 bolts &amp; gear. Climb up to a small overlap passing a few bolts. Continue up trending left towards the main right-facing corner. Smear up the right-facing corner and climb a gear-protected layback crack higher up to a two bolt belay on the left wall.\n\nP4. 29m, 5.9, 5 bolts &amp; gear. Continue up the corner above to the first bolt. Step left (5.9) and make a rising traverse towards a second bolt. Climb up and left past a third bolt then ascend a broken groove straight up followed by a thin finger crack. A final bolt-protected slab move (5.9) leads to a two bolt anchor at the top of the Goat Wall.\n\nFrom the top of this section, stow the rope away and scramble left &amp; up to the NW Ridge of Half Dome. To reach the next section on the SW face of Half Dome, follow the gentle ridge towards Half Dome for 200m. At a point where the ridge steepens again, scramble down 20m towards Ymir Bowl. Contour in a Southeasterly direction below the base of the SW face along loose talus for 200m.\n\nThis climb starts about 15m right of a large right-facing corner located in the center of the wall. Depending on snow coverage, pitch 1 can be bypassed by scrambling up easy ledges 20m to the right and traversing back left across a loose/grassy ledge to the P1 anchor.\nAll bolted anchors. standard rack."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"N2K6qrZWVjGGdTOFmfnXgA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.12468,49.44155]}},"createdBy":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","_change":{"user":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","historyId":"64140905f0cf0083295f1b86","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:30:29.222Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,956b8396-ff15-51ec-97cf-d2fb73497766,dc3e952a-2827-5306-9e90-d96da658be6f,922b06b5-9f58-55ab-a197-ac68b75b417b,3762baaa-b656-5631-8675-338599f9d780","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Kootenays West","Nelson","Whitewater Rocks","Goat Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.12468,49.44155]},"bbox":[-117.12537154717894,49.44110033981815,-117.12398845282105,49.441999660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"N2K6qrZWVjGGdTOFmfnXgA=="},"content":{"description":"This Wall offers the most pitches at Whitewater and is the first wall you get to."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140905f0cf0083295f1b86","prevHistoryId":"64140903f0cf0083295f1b7e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:30:23.415Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:58.402Z","updatedBy":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg=="}
