The rock is made up of a very compact form of Granite with imbedded quartz? type crystals and bulletproof (sloper) features that makes for some very interesting climbing. Although there aren’t a lot of problems, the quality and its proximity to Nelson make it a fine choice for a quick before or after work session but could also keep you busy for a day or two! Lots of shade opportunities and morning sun make it a nice choice for summer mornings when the forest is nice and cool. Climbers have been dabbing on a few of the boulders over the years judging by bits of chalk evidence but a recent surge in development has sprouted up many new fantastic problems that certainly make this place worth checking out! Oh, and did I mention, the infamous ‘Red Sands’ beach is located just below the bouldering area that makes for a perfect post climb dip. Enjoy…\n\nGuidebook\nhttp://www.westkootenaybouldering.ca/"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414081ff0cf0083295f1091","prevHistoryId":"64140819f0cf0083295f104e","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:26:11.618Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:50.016Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
