Unlike a lot of the rock around the immediate Nelson area these boulders are full of features, which makes for 105 awesome boulder problems of all grades and styles. Many of the lines follow lips, cracks and arêtes and offer a unique climbing experience that is signature to the bouldering here. There is a ton of good climbing and combined with the view, atmosphere and proximity to town, this is THE best bouldering to be had in Nelson, B.C.\n\nPeople have been climbing in Grohman for quite a while now, and while this guide has done its best to name and grade most of the problems, much of the information has become obscured as far as first ascents and names go. The star ratings and general grade consensus is mostly that of the author and some bouldering locals. Similar to Squamish, this type of granite takes time to hone your skills on, slopers, smeary feet, and committing top outs are the norm here and it takes a different climbing style to achieve success. Having said this, the climbing is very natural and it’s a wonderful place to gain strength and learn how to trust the rock. Bring your camera, as many pads as you can muster up, your brush, tape, your best climbing friends, a whole bunch of stoke and you are going to have one awesome time here. Happy sending!!! A.R\n\nSpecial Note on Access: Please do your best to keep a low profile while walking the tracks seeing is how it is actually private property and we are not supposed to be trespassing here. As of late the RCMP &amp; CP Rail Employees have been cracking down on the Squatters and the trespassing. They don’t seem to mind us climbers YET, but do please limit your time on the tracks and pick up after yourself. This could be a touchy situation and we don’t want to jeopardize our access to this wonderful place.\n\nPrintable (free) topo.guide download here:  \nhttp://www.westkootenaybouldering.com"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641408c1f0cf0083295f187a","prevHistoryId":"641408b7f0cf0083295f17e7","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":12,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:28:02.096Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:17.926Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
