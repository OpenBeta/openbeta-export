Most challenging clip was the first one, but I wouldn't describe it as the crux. \n\nI had my kids with me (8 &amp; 11) they had a hard time with the start but I let them begin in the crack climbers right. Once they were on the wall they made it to the top. \n\n\n\nLocated about half way down On Pyramid Rock. Look for large spray painted 'Sexy Rock and Roll' on the wall (base). It is just the left of that. If you have gone to the Tunnel Rock, you have gone too far back track maybe 150-200 m. See also pg. 44 of the Nelson and Area Climbers Guide.
