The crux is either a thin section of crack in the middle of the corner or not pumping out on the traverse. A test piece of both gear placement and climbing skill at the grade.\n\nYou can top rope the neighbouring 12.b from the anchor.\n\n\n\nWalk past \"Funky Earth Mother Chick\" a short distance watching for a trail up from the main path. Follow the trail for one minute to the very obvious corner crack topped by an imposing roof.\n\nStandard rack.
