This area was originally developed in the early 2000s. Blaze Wall and Cheddar Wall were cleaned and retro-bolted as part of the TAWKROC Adopt-a-Crag initiative in Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. It's easy to access the top of these walls to set up top ropes by walking up the ramp between Blaze and Cheddar walls to access the top of the crags."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140956f0cf0083295f1f23","prevHistoryId":"64140951f0cf0083295f1ee9","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:31:43.033Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:11.767Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
