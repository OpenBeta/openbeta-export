After about an hour and a bit of hiking from the Gibson Lake parking lot you enter a grand valley and come upon Kokanee Lake. The hiking has now got even better, you've gained most your elevation and things really start to open up. Wait a second, what are those big blocs at the bottom of that slide? \n\nThe visitors to the park will be asking you the whole way up, what are those giant things you are carrying? Well let me tell you... there is some sick bouldering up here and it is worth the hour and a half hike up with these silly things on our back that keep us from breaking our ankles :) Not only is the climbing aesthetic but, the rock is made up of a super high quality granite that offers all kinds of awesome problems! Combine this with an amazing atmosphere, fine views and a great hike in and you have a worthy destination! There is lots of potential as well for more (harder) problems! Go check it out before the snows of October, the climbing is just above 2000m and it faces northeast…. i.e. a great summer bouldering spot! \n\nJust as a note, the landings are all made up of Talus, major efforts have been made to build the rocks/landings up making most of the problems quite safe, but care should be taken on some of the harder problems (it’s a long hike out). \n\nAbout 30-40 minutes past the boulders are great opportunities for overnighting at both the designated backcountry campground at Kaslo Lake &amp; the famous Kokanee Glacier Cabin (both need to be booked prior). Random camping in the parking lot or Gibson Lake cabin is not permitted and this is strictly enforced. There are also many opportunities along the FSR to camp as well (beauty spots at about 6km &amp; 14km markers) or down at Kokanee Creek Campground right on the beach."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140785f0cf0083295f0950","prevHistoryId":"6414077ff0cf0083295f08eb","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:23:50.328Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:47.653Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
