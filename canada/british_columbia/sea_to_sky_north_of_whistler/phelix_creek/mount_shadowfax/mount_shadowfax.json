Follow this to the big ledge with two boulders stacked on one another. Belay here. 10c.\n\nP2 - Move the belay up and over the boulders to the next ledge on the left. Begin up the bushy crack system trending right onto the face. Climb up past one bolt into a difficult groove. Clip the second bolt at the crux and continue straight up past two more bolts to a belay at a ledge. Save a 0.2 for after the second bolt - bit spicy. It's nice to have thin gear for the belay (ball nuts work well if you got them). 11a.\n\nP3 - Traverse left to the arete and follow it up. Good pro. Belay on or just before the massive ledge. Can scramble to the top from here. 5.8.\n\nDescent:  Rap 30m from a big dying tree to a large sideways tree on the west face. Rap another 60m to the ground over Crack of Doom. Likely possible to do an intermediate rap from another tree or from the anchor of Crack of Doom if you don't have two ropes.\n\nFrom the hut, head east to the second of two buttresses off Mt Shadowfax (this is east sub-summit of Mt Shadowfax). Head north up the gully until you hit the wall (climber's right). Crack of Doom is immediately there on the west facing wall. For Riders, traverse to the south side of the wall along a goat trail. The route starts with a layback in a corner beside a 'V' chimney. If you squeeze past a tree and the wall you've gone too far (the climb is just before this).\nSR to 4\". Doubles from 0.2 to 1\".
