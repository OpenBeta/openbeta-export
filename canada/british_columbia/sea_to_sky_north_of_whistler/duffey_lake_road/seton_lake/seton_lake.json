Route climbs the right side of the massive flow shared with Winter Water Sports and Piss 'n' Vinegar. Starting right out of the lake, P1 goes up and right to a steep but short section to gain the main flow. Next, multiple pitches of WI3 climbing get you about halfway up the wall, where it starts to steepen. The upper half pitches were mostly WI4 and up, with some probably in the WI5 range with technical and/or sustained steep climbing with a variety of ice types and climbing styles. The route eases off a bit near the top. Descend on V-threads. \n\nWe encountered a lot of wet pitches on the lower half so bringing ropes with good condition high quality dry coatings is highly recommended.\n\n\n\nTravel west across the lake approximately 3.5 miles. Pass several smaller flows on the way out. This large flow is on the south side of the lake and is impossible to miss.\n\nMany screws, double ropes, V-thread supplies"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Gswz/vupVXCT5KVkF55fUg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.98871,50.66833]}},"createdBy":"QNlkstquU8GrJypTpbr3VQ==","_change":{"user":"QNlkstquU8GrJypTpbr3VQ==","historyId":"641411a4f0cf0083295f7b70","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:07:16.889Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,97a2a48c-af8c-5b4e-a4ef-9ffe05fdf2ff,5ce3c1a5-b19b-5571-a044-716857d6afc2,1acc33fe-fba9-5570-93e4-a564179e5f52","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Sea to Sky (North of Whistler)","Duffey Lake Road","Seton Lake"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.98871,50.66833]},"bbox":[-121.98941945746674,50.667880339818126,-121.98800054253329,50.668779660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"Gswz/vupVXCT5KVkF55fUg=="},"content":{"description":"Lake just SW of Lillooet.
