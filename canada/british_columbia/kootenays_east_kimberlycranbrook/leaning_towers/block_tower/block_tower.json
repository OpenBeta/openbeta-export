This route traverses right at the first bulge and follows hard cracks up to the summit ridge (much 5.10). \n                        First Ascent from CAJ 1989       \n The first ascent party rappelled the route after sumiting.  The first rappel was not down the last pitch.  Instead, the overhanging prow of the ridge was done as a free rappel (two ropes off natural anchor).  Then three more double rope rappels to the snow boots (eh?). \n  \n PROTECTION \n                        Based on this photo, I'm thinking double cams up to #4 and a single #5.       \n Looks like hex's work okay (5.9+).  The cracks thins before the summit ridge but gets steeper too (CAJ '89).   \n  \n APPROACH DETAILS \n This team approached via the med level traverse from Dewar Creek Hot Springs.    They also made the second ascent of the Twomey-McComb-Meyer east buttress route on Hall Peak.  Both teams may have also pioneered the \"East Face Glacier Traverse\" to the northern end of the range.  There is a short technical section to cross over the north ridge of Hall.  \n  \n For endless backpacking route discussion and maps at the Mountain Project Leaning Towers page. \n                        Dewar Creek to Block Tower Mid-Level Traverse  (estimate in yellow)\n\n.\n."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"6ELzXAWzW3iJ/dMnE97ILQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.59132,49.97329]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"64140343f0cf0083295eda3e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:05:55.327Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,332c717c-0b54-5c16-8552-7aef34f6a90c,77f18059-0c96-587a-ad4a-1c21e5e840da,e842f35c-05b3-5b78-89fd-d32713dec82d","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Kootenays East (Kimberly/Cranbrook)","Leaning Towers","Block Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.59132,49.97329]},"bbox":[-116.59201915870419,49.97284033981814,-116.59062084129576,49.97373966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"6ELzXAWzW3iJ/dMnE97ILQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.59201915870419,49.97284033981814],[-116.59062084129576,49.97284033981814],[-116.59062084129576,49.97373966018186],[-116.59201915870419,49.97373966018186],[-116.59201915870419,49.97284033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"INTRODUCTION \n The last of the leaning Towers to be climbed (1973). Even so, it would seem that Hall and Wall might be the harder summits.   \n                        Leaning Towers, BC       \n ROUTE SUMMARY \n                        Unclimbed Routes Climbing, Kletteren, Arampicata,  Escalade, Leaning Towers, BC       \n Patrick Morrow and Chris Perry made the first ascent via the west face slabs:  \"no rope involved\".  It is likely that Slim Princess finishes on the same upper north ridge scrambling. \n  \n An easier route to get to from the tarn camp would be the overhung Enagonio-Mank on the southeast ridge - #3 &amp; #4 sized 5.10 cracks, just right of the steepest part of the ridge.  This first ascent of this route, by Bob Enagonio and Don Mank, was the second ascent of Block in 1988.  They rappelled back to the Hall-Block col with four double rope rappels, the top rap being overhung! \n  \n 1997, Gut Edwards and Sean Issac put up a difficult aid route on the east face called Trout Fishing in America, IV, 5.10+, A3.  Fixed gear should help to find this route.  The first six pitches are mostly aid.  Pitch seven is the crux all free crack. \n  \n Mid July, 2015, Jasmin Caton and Kate Rutherford climbed \"the smallest route in the cirque\" - Slim Princess, 5.10, 250 meters. Overall, the route is five pitches followed by 100 meters of scrambling up the north ridge.  The last pitch to the col was a crux with giant lichen petals blocking the feet on a reachy finger-lock roof.  They rappelled their own route, no bolts."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140343f0cf0083295eda3e","prevHistoryId":"64140342f0cf0083295eda36","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:05:52.651Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:41.669Z","updatedBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw=="}
