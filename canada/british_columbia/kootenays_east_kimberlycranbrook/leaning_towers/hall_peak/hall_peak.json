This ascent was also the sixth ascent of Hall Peak and the first ascent team were probably the first serious big wall team to succeed in the Leaning Towers, and without heli-support.

Please see the Leaning Towers page for approach details. \n                        contour interval 20m       \n FIRST ASCENT TEAM MEMBERS \n Art Twomey must have been the guy on the team who knew about the walls of the Leaning Tower and knew the best approach route.  In the late 1960's he built a small cabin in the Purcells to meticulously photograph the wilderness. He then used his results to convince the British Columbia government to create both Saint Mary's Provincial Park and Purcell Wilderness Conservancy.  Yeah, Art Twomney is the one who got the choppers banned!  (Thank you man!!) Ironically, he died in a helicopter crash in 1997. \n  \n Maybe someone can tell us more about Joe Meyer.  All I could find is that Joe was good enough to climb a 5.11 in 1977: The Womb @ Looking Glass, NC (Mountain Project contributors Rob Dillon, Bob Rotert, 2006)        \n  \n The 1975 photo on the Pulpit  page shows a lady bat-hooking her way up what is still the most radical unclimbed wall in the Purcell Mountains.  Joanna McComb must be the first woman to have used Warren Harding's technique for climbing on a wall as big and steep as the Leaning Tower in Yosemite (still unclimbed).  Also in 1957, she put up the first truly technical route on Baboquivari Peak, the Southeast Arete - Still the most popular route on the mountain (Stewart Green, Rock Climbing Arizona, 1999).  She was called one of the best local climbers by Tucson's local newspaper in 1973. \n                        photo by Ben Fairbank of Joanna McComb &amp; Dan Jones on FA of Don's Crack, 1966, posted by Mountain Project contributor Charles Vernon, 2012\n\n.\n."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"DHkBahJUVveDr7wRgIJhBw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.58811,49.97505]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"64140346f0cf0083295eda63","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:05:58.706Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,332c717c-0b54-5c16-8552-7aef34f6a90c,77f18059-0c96-587a-ad4a-1c21e5e840da,0c79016a-1254-56f7-83af-bc1180826107","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Kootenays East (Kimberly/Cranbrook)","Leaning Towers","Hall Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.58811,49.97505]},"bbox":[-116.58880918427613,49.97460033981813,-116.58741081572389,49.97549966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"DHkBahJUVveDr7wRgIJhBw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.58880918427613,49.97460033981813],[-116.58741081572389,49.97460033981813],[-116.58741081572389,49.97549966018186],[-116.58880918427613,49.97549966018186],[-116.58880918427613,49.97460033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"HALL PEAK \n                        by Matthew Morriss &amp; Winter Ramos 2014       \n INTRODUCTION \n Hall Peak is the highest peak in the Leaning Towers. It was once known as the Leaning Tower.  There are at least six routes on the mountain.  One sub-peak, the Pulpit, has a very steep prow that pleasantly faces east. \n  \n APPROACH ROUTES \n Please go to the Leaning Towers page for approach options. \n                         Glaciers! (blue)       \n NORTH RIDGE 5.6 - THE STANDARD ROUTE \n                        Photo by Justin Scurlock Paint by Ryan Leary 2013 Published online by AAJ 2014 Dashes added by KT       \n The 1933 first ascent team approached the Hall-Block col from the west and then climbed slabs and snow directly to the summit.   \n  \n Nowadays, climbers mostly hike via Dewar Creek.  From a camp below the East Face of Hall Peak,  side hill northward across unnamed glaciers found under the northeast face of Hall until the cliffs diminish (shown in photo above). After the short technical crossing of the North Ridge, the route turns back southward and climbs up the North Ridge to the 5.6 summit cliffs.         \n  \n ROCK CLIMBING SUMMARY \n Both the McCoubrey and North Ridge routes are described aboveand in the MP menu. Also, the original east face is posted as Quarter Life Crises, 5.10.  A couple of big routes are still to be posted (so FA members, or others, can fill in details). \n  \n The inside cover of the 2015 Patagonia winter catalog has a fantastic picture of the 2013 East Face Upper Ramp, 5.9, A1, 1,700' (Ryan Leary-Evan Reimondo ACC). \n  \n The best line in the towers is now the Direct Northeast Buttress, 5.9+, 17 pitches (Matthew Moriss-Winter Ramos, 2014).   \n  \n SKI DESCENTS \n The McCoubrey Route, or thereabouts, has been skied several times, at least once without rappels or helicopter support (Patagonia Expedition reports, 2015)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140346f0cf0083295eda63","prevHistoryId":"64140346f0cf0083295eda59","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:05:55.773Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:47.063Z","updatedBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw=="}
