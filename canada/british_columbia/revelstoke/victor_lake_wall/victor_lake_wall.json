From the base, climb up and generally right following bolts. All belays are bolted. You cannot get lost because there are sooooo many bolts. Most pitches are 35-45 m.\n\nAt the 10th pitch, head up and right— the line of bolts that goes straight up is Trans Canada. The final three pitches: go right and straight up (10a). Go hard right and up (10a). Go hard left and pull a crux mantle, then up a slab to the end (10b).  \n\nThe first three and final five pitches are the $$. \n\n\n\n\n\nDrive 13.1 km west from Revelstoke to a pullout on the right/north side of Victor Lake. There is a sign marking the trail. \n\nHead uphill to a junction 25 min. Turn right at junction and walk/scramble until you get to fixed ropes. Follow these until they end at the base of a slab with bolts.  \n\n18 draws and 6-8 longer slings. 70m rope. The Beglinger guide recommends Camalots .4-#4.
