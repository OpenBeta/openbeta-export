The dirt trail head parking lot is on the east side of the highway, a bit below the highway's grade.   \n  \n From the trail head, hike down the trail for about 1km until a signed climbers trail leaves the main trail and leads up left to the climbs. \n                        Monashee Mountains       \n                        At least three sources led me to believe that Begbie Bluffs are west of  Highway 23. This map should help.        \n The rock is quartzite, similar to Lake Louise or Mount Sir Donald.  The huge central roof has lots of hard routes with fixed draws.  Moderates are found at both ends of the bluff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141073f0cf0083295f6fc3","prevHistoryId":"6414106af0cf0083295f6f6c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:01:43.709Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:01:44.808Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
