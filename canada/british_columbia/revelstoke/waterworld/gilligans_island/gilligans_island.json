Climbing up from the water is an absolute joy, and adds to the sense of adventure. The crux is on the second pitch, when traversing left with somewhat awkward feet and a slight feeling of exposure. For full details, refer to Ruedi's guidebook: Revelstoke Rocks.\n\nPitch 1 (5.7 15m): traverse right of the belay then up into the right facing corner. Use great holds and features throughout to get to the anchor.\n\nPitch 2 (5.9 25m): Climb diagonally up and left, following the bolts to the anchor.\n\nDescent: Rap down to the initial ledge to the right of the start of boulevard.Â \n\n\n\nFrom the base of The Boulevard, on the large ledge, traverse right. Use the bolts on the face for protection while climbing to the right, a belay strongly recommended. Stop at the rap rings before the end of the ledge. Rap down to the ledge below, near the water.
