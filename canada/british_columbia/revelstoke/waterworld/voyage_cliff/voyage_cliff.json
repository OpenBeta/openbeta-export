Then switch it up by trending right (pass rap anchors) and go all the way to top of the wall. Some moss to navigate around, but still enjoyable climbing.\n\n\nStart on the the base ledge. First pitch trend up and left. \n\nAll bolted. Approximately 11, 16, and 18(ish) bolts on pitches 1, 2 and 3 respectively (assuming pitch 3 is climbed to the top).
