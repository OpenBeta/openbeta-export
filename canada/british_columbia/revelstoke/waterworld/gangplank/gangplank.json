Some loose rock on this pitch so stay heads up. The bolt line then heads up passing the crux moves on crimps. After passing the roof, there is a two bolt belay. I would recommend continuing on up to the next anchor less than ~10m above, otherwise you'll end up with some heinous rope drag for the next pitch.
