Requires good footwork and body position, but a rewarding and unique experience for the region. This is the easiest multipitch at Lauretta Slabs and a worthy half day of climbing. For the full description, refer to the Guidebook Revelstoke Rocks by Ruedi Beglinger. The crux is on the second pitch, with a tricky traverse right on terrible feet. A second crux is found stepping up onto the roof/higher ledge on pitch 5.\n\n\n\nStart up the left most line of bolts from the top of the boulder field. Basically take the left-most line of bolts at each junction or opportunity.\n\nPitch 1 (5.7 35m): climb the easy slab to the anchor at a ledge below the roof.\n\nPitch 2 (5.10a 20m): traverse right the up across a tricky crux.\n\nPitch 3 (5.10a 35m): climb up and leftward, following the bolts.\n\nPitch 4 (5.5 27m): traverse left then up.\n\nPitch 5 (5.10a 30m): a second crux as you step up onto a sloping ledge without a positive hand-hold. Once over the ledge, aim left.\n\nPitch 6 (5.8 22m): climb up, then to the right.\n\nPitch 7 (5.9 28m): the final pitch over some easier slabby sections to the anchors. Congrats!!\n\nBolted anchors and rap rings at the top of each pitch. A 70m rope or twin 60m ropes are required to rappel from anywhere. Bring 9 quickdraws and 2 alpine draws for the route."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"+32PeztpXu2j/+7jbDAwrw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.93163,51.07177]}},"createdBy":"k3iQ7SL3W7Wt3rAzYRl5aQ==","_change":{"user":"k3iQ7SL3W7Wt3rAzYRl5aQ==","historyId":"6414109af0cf0083295f7160","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:02:50.485Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,761dedee-f3e3-537e-9364-9cb9f9792677,fb7d8f7b-3b69-5eed-a3ff-eee36c3030af","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Revelstoke","Lauretta Slabs"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.93163,51.07177]},"bbox":[-117.93234562463421,51.07132033981815,-117.93091437536579,51.072219660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"+32PeztpXu2j/+7jbDAwrw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.93234562463421,51.07132033981815],[-117.93091437536579,51.07132033981815],[-117.93091437536579,51.072219660181865],[-117.93234562463421,51.072219660181865],[-117.93234562463421,51.07132033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"An amazing section of slab climbing on slick quartzite rock inside Revelstoke National Park. The view across the valley is spectacular, and the routes are pure friction and balance. A place to approach grades humbly if you're not used to slab climbing. The routes are all well bolted sport climbs and falls are actually quite safe (run down if falling!). You'll be surrounded by beautiful forest on all sides while climbing, and unlikely to have company. Ruedi and Nicoline Beglinger put much effort into retro bolting the routes in 2017, after initially bolting them in the early 90's, and full descriptions can be found in Ruedi's excellent book: Revelstoke Rocks."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414109af0cf0083295f7160","prevHistoryId":"64141098f0cf0083295f715a","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:02:47.030Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:55.119Z","updatedBy":"k3iQ7SL3W7Wt3rAzYRl5aQ=="}
