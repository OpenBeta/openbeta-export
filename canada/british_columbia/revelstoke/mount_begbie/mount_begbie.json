It even gets done via bicycles from Revelstoke since the trail head is just ten kilometers or so down Highway 23. \n  \n A trail leads to timberline and the glacier.  Roped travel is advised due to crevasse hazard. There is a short rock pitch over a step near the summit with a single rope rappel at the top. \n  \n SKI ASCENT \n R Lymburne skied solo from the summit of Mount Begbie in 1932!!  He left Revelstoke at 4am with a car, reached the glacier at 8am, summited at 1pm, and returned to town at 6pm.  He had to take off his skis and kick step to the summit with fear of a 2,000 foot slide (CAJ 1932)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6414109ef0cf0083295f7175","prevHistoryId":"6414109bf0cf0083295f716a","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:02:51.976Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:15.562Z","updatedBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw=="}
