There are two areas; one upstream from the bridge and one downstream.   \n  \n The trail down to the lower area is more technical with lots of rope ladders in place.  There are more routes and also a lot of fixed draws on the hardest routes.  The clean water, sculpted rock, and rain forest are fantastic on a hot summer day. \n  \n For the upper area, first cross the bridge and up and over the road-cut to find the very steep trail down.  route names and ratings can be found written on plaques for some routes. \n                        Blanket Creek Sport Climbing Area"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414108df0cf0083295f70ea","prevHistoryId":"64141083f0cf0083295f7082","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:02:25.442Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:02:26.485Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
