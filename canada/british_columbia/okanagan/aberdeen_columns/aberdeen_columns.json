The area provides 140+ steep columnar basalt crack climbs ranging in height from 12m to 25m. The rock is solid and provides high quality cam and the occasional nut placements.\n\nThe popular climbs are clean, less-traveled routes may still have some loose rock and lichen. The Aberdeen and Edwin walls are the true standouts of the crag.\n\nLink to guidebook: http://www.climbkamloops.ca/?p=111 downloadable as free pdf\nThe information used to create the Mountain Project pages was used with permission from Lyle Knight."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140c6bf0cf0083295f40b6","prevHistoryId":"64140c5ff0cf0083295f402c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:43:26.888Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:43:27.934Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
