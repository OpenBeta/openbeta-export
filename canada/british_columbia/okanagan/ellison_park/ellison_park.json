This area has a few walls with mostly mixed/trad climbing, but also offers some sweet bouldering. The beach boulder is the only thing in the shade in the afternoon, bring sunscreen! A lot of the routes allow for top ropes to be setup from the top of the cliffs. \n  \n Please note, this information about this crag is a work in progress. Please feel free to add to this page any routes or areas, as I have only been there once and will only be adding the climbs I have tried."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140d10f0cf0083295f4853","prevHistoryId":"64140d0df0cf0083295f482d","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:47:33.352Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:10.553Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
