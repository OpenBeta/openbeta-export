This area has a few walls with mostly mixed/trad climbing, but also offers some sweet bouldering. The beach boulder is the only thing in the shade in the afternoon, bring sunscreen! A lot of the routes allow for top ropes to be setup from the top of the cliffs. \n  \n Please note, this information about this crag is a work in progress.
