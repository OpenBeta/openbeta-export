Much of the area is completely unexplored with respect to climbing due to it's difficult access and remoteness. Access can be greatly enhanced by hiring the Cathedral Lakes Lodge Jeep to drive you up to the core area. From there, three campsites are a short walk from the lodge, offering amazing lakeside camping in the sub-alpine. You can not camp at Goat Lake but it is only a 4.5km easy hike from Lake Of The Woods camp.\n\nThe area has that dry, Okanagan feel, while maintaining lush alpine meadows and lakes full of trout. Buy a fishing license and bring a rod to catch your supper on a rest day. The Lodge is also a very short walk from the campsites if you feel like strolling over for dinner or just enjoying a beer on the patio.\n\nThe rock is typically excellent quality granite with corners, slabs, and splitter cracks. Depending on aspect, the rock ranges from completely clean to completely lichen covered. Sunny exposures provide beautiful rock with little cleaning required to climb. You need a sense of adventure considering this is full alpine rock climbing with barely any routes. The climbing presents the full scope of normal alpine rock hazards including, loose rock, rockfall, snow slopes, and vegetated climbing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140c85f0cf0083295f41f4","prevHistoryId":"64140c85f0cf0083295f41ea","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:45:20.854Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:45:25.703Z","updatedBy":"/wJHSPmCXh6lktIWpbGMpQ=="}
