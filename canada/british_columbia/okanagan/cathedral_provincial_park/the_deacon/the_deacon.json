Grades listed below are as per the first ascensionist's grading in his guidebook (see comments below for my personal take).\n\nP1 10a: Undercling up the ramp slanting up and right, around a couple corners and across to a bush, then up and belay at a flat ledge.\n\nP2 10c: A mega pitch; dynamic and exciting climbing. From the belay climb up a somewhat broken corner to the right, then charge upwards onto a thin face. Slab climb out left to a jug and reach your foot to the slab ramp. Epic stemming up thin opposing edges, climb past our welded nut halfway up the pitch, then a short move left through overlaps Pro is thin but bomber. Finally, traverse hard right and across horns to a hanging belay. Belay block is loose, climb higher into the corner for good gear.\n\nP3 11b: Straightforward climbing up the pumpy layback up the 11b corner, expect some lichen in your eye.\n\nP4 5.9: Step right from the belay into a large pocket, bisected by a #2 crack. Pull through the bulge then continue up into less obvious terrain. Fingercracks and thin edges trend up and slightly left. Semi-hanging belay after ~35m.\n\nP5: 5.9: Slighty loose, variably sized crack ascends a short corner then face. Cruxy start leads to easier terrain and a belay in broken, jagged terrain.\n\nP6-7 10a, 5.6: Move left to an short and comparably easy finger crack before breaking out into easy 5.6 terrain. Worth linking P6 and 7; climb as far as you can up the 5.6 and belay. Scramble to the summit\n\nDescent: Scramble up along the ridge then drop down before the loose blocky towers. Make a ~20m rap then traverse across and up through loose rock, fortunately lower angle and exposure than the blocky towers. Hit the summit and traverse down a wonderful ridgeline. Cornices form over the gulleys along the ridgeline so shortcutting across snow in early season is ill-advised.\n\n\n\nStart at the same 'V' as for the Sentinel Direct, at climbers left of the wall. P1 climbs a ramp slanting up and right\n\nDouble tips to #2, single #3, RPs and other thin pro like ballnuts help."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"lvbHU/NSW32yHoTsjdvbiQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.18771,49.00638]}},"createdBy":"cA+doI87XbWNiXhFufH+Vw==","_change":{"user":"cA+doI87XbWNiXhFufH+Vw==","historyId":"64140c7ef0cf0083295f41b1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:45:18.913Z"},{"_id":"WdojNEPiQ1GBlosumlt5RQ==","name":"Sentinel Direct","grades":{"yds":"5.10c"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","length":273,"content":{"description":"\nAn awesome route on great rock. mostly quality pitches\n\nP1 10a: At the base of the 'V', climb the left fork through slammer hand jams, pulling through a small roof and continuing up to a belay on a ramp. Very fun pitch.\n\nP2 10c: Directly above the belay is a small finger crack dihederal. Climb up about 15 meters then step left into an obvious easier crack slanting up and left. Tenderly yard on some bushes to finish at a nice belay ledge. Note: there are two similar dihederals at the start of this pitch, climb the one on the left; the right does not meet up with the upper slanting crack and you might be hosed.\n\nP3 5.7: Ramble up and right through some non obvious terrain, traversing across a couple pedestals into some broken, lightly vegetated cracks.\n\nP4 5.9: Up and right to a lush, narrow belay ledge.\n\nP5 10a: An epic lieback/ stemming pitch in a thin corner.\n\nP6 10c: ??\n\nP7-8 5.7: Easy blocky terrain to the summit\n\nDescent: Scramble up along the ridge then drop down before the loose blocky towers.
