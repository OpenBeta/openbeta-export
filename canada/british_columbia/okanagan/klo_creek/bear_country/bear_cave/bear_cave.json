Take a final shake out even though you haven't burned anything yet and drop the hammer until you clip the last perma (#8) and clear the lip.\n\nPerma #6 can be a bit tricky to clip, but all falls after first 5 permas should be clean even if you blow a clip. No individual move is ripper hard, but it is tenuous, sequencey, sustained, and really easy to botch! Run out from perma 8 to the chains in easy (5.8) terrain. if you somehow blew the chains I don't think you would hit the ground, but probably not a great idea to test that theory either. \n\nIf you opt for a knee pad, throw it on your right leg.\n\nSecond line from the left.
