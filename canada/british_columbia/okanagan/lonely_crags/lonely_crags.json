Drive down to Okanagan Lake and take a dip afterward to get the dust off; the lake views will force you to do this."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140d5cf0cf0083295f4c10","prevHistoryId":"64140d59f0cf0083295f4bf5","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:48:45.568Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:48:46.653Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
