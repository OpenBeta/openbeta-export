A thin streak of ice down the center of the wall will be obvious after extended cold due to the southwest aspect. Get it before it goes in the sun (around 1pm in February).\n\nP1) A short initial pillar leads to a couple options to reach a cave at 40m height. WI3+ 40m\n\nP2) The money. Anything from overhanging, unconsolidated chandeliers to hooked out sun-baked slush. Expect 3D climbing and thoughtful protection. WI5-6 60m\n\nP3) A short final pillar leads into a groove to a tree. The final section can be VERY sun-baked. WI4-5 40m\n\nRappel the route on v-threads\n\n\n\nFollow the Enderby Cliffs Provincial Park trail for 1.5km until it makes a u-turn to the south. Continue north following flagging tape to the base. If the trail is beat in, it could take an hour. If not, it could be three.\n\nScrews"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"hWNuf6FbU+ufjxLbsYUxKA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.0804,50.58692]}},"createdBy":"s7kTrf36V0aSnankAe7Zdg==","_change":{"user":"s7kTrf36V0aSnankAe7Zdg==","historyId":"64140d1bf0cf0083295f4913","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:47:55.589Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,afa002b9-328b-5368-8ddf-ac6d1a1c5f5c,85636e7f-a15b-53eb-9f8f-12dbb1853128","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Okanagan","Enderby Cliffs Provincial Park"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.0804,50.58692]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"hWNuf6FbU+ufjxLbsYUxKA=="},"content":{"description":"Despite the questionable rock quality, or perhaps because of it, Enderby Cliffs Provincial Park occasionally holds ice, including the modern classic Mythologic."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140d1bf0cf0083295f4913","prevHistoryId":"64140d1af0cf0083295f490d","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:47:53.066Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:47:55.597Z","updatedBy":"s7kTrf36V0aSnankAe7Zdg=="}
