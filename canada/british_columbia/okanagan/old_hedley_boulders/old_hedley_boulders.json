The boulders are located at the base of a large talus slope; many boulders rolled into the forest below, providing sandy landings for some problems. Most boulders are found in the toe of the talus, however, resulting in less-than-perfect landings. Bring a crashmat! There are many pictographs in the area (on the Pictograph Boulder, for example). DO NOT CLIMB ON or TOUCH the pictographs! They are a significant cultural resource, are interesting to look at, and have substantial meaning to the local first nations peoples. Do not damage them in any way! In many instances, pictographs were drawn by young men on vision quests. As this is a new area, many of the problems may be a bit dirty, and beware of the occasional loose rock. If you want to establish new problems, feel free â€“ a wire brush is recommended."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140d99f0cf0083295f4ef7","prevHistoryId":"64140d96f0cf0083295f4ed3","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:49:14.094Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:49:15.091Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
