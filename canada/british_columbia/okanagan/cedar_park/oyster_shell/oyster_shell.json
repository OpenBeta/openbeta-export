Urness, Chris Leachman '96","length":4,"content":{"description":"Start by scrambling up to the belay ledge with your belayer. Here, there is a \"belay\" bolt at head height, clip this when you start out, have your belayer unclip it after you get bolt 2. \n\nFrom the belay ledge, head straight up a few feet, and then cruise up an easy left leaning ramp to your first real bolt. This bolt protects the first real move of the route. After this bolt, continue up to the no hands rest ledge where you can stand, and using an undercling on the roof (find it, it's camouflaged a bit near where the roof intersects the wall), reach back over your head and clip the perma-draw which protects what is obviously the crux. \n\nTurn the roof on big holds and clip your next couple bolts above the lip. Wow, you're so strong, that roof was easy! Sadly, you were mislead, that roof comes in at ~5.10+, the real crux comes at the next roof/buldge as you trend right and up. \n\nThis section has at least two options: \n1, blind dyno to an okay ledge hold\n2, techy face climbing with a blind reach\n\nEither way, once you gain the ledge hold, you still have to turn the bulge! After you turn the bulge, traverse up and left under another big roof on low angle terrain and collect yourself. Back to your right on the roof you just passed under there is a bolt (long draw this one). Finish out on dirty and loose rock to the anchors (easy, big holds).\n\nAlternative finish: after the first roof and next couple of bolts, branch left and traverse up and around the next roof to the anchors of \"Blue Monday\". Looked easier to me, but I didn't try!\n\nLook for the biggest, proudest roof in the middle of the bluff. Spot the perma, this is your line.<br /><br />Don't be intimidated by the height of the belay ledge. Climb into it from down/left (west) of it, your hardest moves rank in at low 5th and are right off the ground.Â \n6 bolts, 2 bolt anchor with chains"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"jBDqiMheUhKtW911R2NYmA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.53155,49.77619]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"64140cc6f0cf0083295f4539","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:46:30.784Z"},{"_id":"WNisEOhEQLaVwBpji7/qZA==","name":"Not So Soft","grades":{"yds":"5.11c"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Dean Urness, Chris Leachman '96","length":21,"content":{"description":"This is the must do rig of Oyster Shell!\n\nFrom the belay ledge, climb up and slightly right, clipping your 1st real bolt (bolt 2 if you count the belay bolt) before turning a reach/slab move. Longdraw your next bolt (first traverse bolt) and cruise a fantastic traverse (no harder than 5.6) past one more bolt to the base of a weakness in the roof. Now is a good time to look up and think \"oh no\".\n\nAs soon as you leave the end of the traverse, it's game on! To your next bolt (#5) is a good warm up for the crux sequence to the 6th bolt (bolt is just above the lip and is visible). This is a really cool on-sight boulder problem as it's hard to envision the movement, but the holds force you into position.\n\nOkay, you've finally clipped bolt 6, but this climb is not over! Pull over the lip to a pseudo ledge where you can stem out a no hands rest, and start cold sweating as you are in airy, slightly run out (but safe) territory. Gain the courage to follow the thin seam straight up until you reach jugs under small overhang. Thank a deity for the jugs, clip your last bolt, and turn the final few easy moves to the chains.\n\nIf you don't have a deity, bring a selection of small-medium nuts to push into the seam. I didn't look too closely, but a BD .3 or .4 cam might fit.\n\nFind the ripper roof with the perm-draw next door to the left, look to the right for the traversing bolt line over to the next over-hang/roof to the east.\n7 draws, 2 bolt anchor with chains.
