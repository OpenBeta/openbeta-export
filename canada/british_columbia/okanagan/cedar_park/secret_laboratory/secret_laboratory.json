Clip, and power up for a big V3 dead point to turn the lip and clip the chains. \n\nFantastic route- the crux is relatively height independent. Whatever reach advantage you have for the dead point is minimized by compressing to get high feet which push you off the wall, no excuses!\n\nLook for the line that goes straight up the left side of the mega roof.
