You can belay from the dirt, or scramble up past the first 2 bolts (maybe 5.5) to the belay ledge and start from there. Either way, simple climbing- big holds, low angle, a couple of mini roofs to pull.\n\nP2: (5.8, 8 bolts, 2 bolt anchor, crux pitch): From the P1: anchor go generally up until you reach a ledge, then head hard left before going up again. You'll be able to see the second bolt above the ledge before you go left, the first will come into view as you traverse over. Long draw the first 3 bolts on this pitch (2 below the ledge, 1 above the ledge), consider putting long draws on other bolts as well to straighten out the rope line. \n\nDo not link pitches, the rope drag is horrendous!\n\nGetting Down: \n1. Walk off- head up a bit past the anchors (there's actually two sets of anchors) and trend climbers right (east) to link up with the well worn summit/walk-off trail. This will bring you down ~100 m east of the last dirt you stood on.\n2. Rap- 2 single rope raps gets you to the ground. Both pitches are &lt;30 m. You can also rap back to the belay ledge and tag the other couple of climbs that start there!\n\nLook for the big roof of the climb next door to the left, from there, look up and to the right for the big corner (white rock down low, weathered grey rock up higher). The roof capped dihedral is also easy to spot, this line crosses very close to this feature. \n8 bolts, 2 bolt anchor with chains (each pitch)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ALI2CG+LUPGf+yMrpOY5pQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.53101,49.77621]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"64140cd4f0cf0083295f45d6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:46:44.382Z"},{"_id":"4j5cpUEDTV2E056KrgW/gA==","name":"Old Times","grades":{"yds":"5.8+"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","length":24,"content":{"description":"First bolt is in the yellowish rock, the line goes up and traverses right a bit.
