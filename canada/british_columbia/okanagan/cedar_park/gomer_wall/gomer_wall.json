Keep the bolt line (3 bolts on this steep section) over your left shoulder as you start, pull out of the corner onto the face, clip your second and third bolts, pull up under the top, larger roof and then take the airy traverse over top of your last bolt to the left before finally pulling up through the weakness in the roof to the chains.
