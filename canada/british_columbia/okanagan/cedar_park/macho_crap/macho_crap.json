Leave your stance using mediocre holds to set yourself up for a monster V5 dead-point (climbing crux), and then figure out how to clip your 3rd bolt (clipping crux).\n\nThen, this rig is just big dead point after big dead-poin after big...nope, just 2 more moves and you're effectively done, reaching up to clip one last bolt that probably no one has ever fallen on. The anchors aren't far above!\n\nSadly, this crux is very height dependent (call this the 180 cm height/wingspan grade). As this climb follows a seam in the roof, there may be alternative solutions for shorter climbers, but I could imagine adding a bonus letter grade or more! \n\nIf you can, pre-hang your draws. Long draw bolt 3 for sure to make clipping more reasonable, perhaps bolt 2 as well so you can reach it before lift off. \n\nThere is an old button head less than 2 m off the ground, do not clip this and do not start going straight up this. Near as I can figure, this is to aid in cleaning and can be used to help keep you out of the tick tree if you're being lowered.Â \n\nFar right of the sector, look for the biggest roof at the base of the bluff. The climb goes up the seam in the roof.\n4 bolts (one hidden over the lip), fixed anchor (1 bolt with a biner, one hook)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"g1BC/+1uXsSjNiOOncntEg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.53122,49.77617]}},"createdBy":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","_change":{"user":"sJ/Kmi+NU0SiSZv9bV4VQg==","historyId":"64140cb6f0cf0083295f4409","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:46:15.001Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,afa002b9-328b-5368-8ddf-ac6d1a1c5f5c,d3eea538-70e7-59f8-b6b6-fcddfa92fc19,835042ff-ed6e-5ec4-a336-238e9dc9ed12","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Okanagan","Cedar Park","Macho Crap"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.53122,49.77617]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"g1BC/+1uXsSjNiOOncntEg=="},"content":{"description":"The trad climbing sector."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140cb6f0cf0083295f4409","prevHistoryId":"64140cb5f0cf0083295f4403","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:46:12.597Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:46:15.013Z","updatedBy":"C5QXq2nHU0WRCxeTct/hNg=="}
