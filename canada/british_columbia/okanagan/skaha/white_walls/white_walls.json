The climbing at these crags varies from gorgeous, long pumpfests (à la Great White) to short, technical nailbiters (à la Little White). With both east- and west-facing walls, a large range of difficulties, and a collection of classic routes, these crags offer a pleasant way to spend a day for climbers of all levels."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140eebf0cf0083295f5dc5","prevHistoryId":"64140ee1f0cf0083295f5d3c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:54:49.120Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:54:51.456Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
