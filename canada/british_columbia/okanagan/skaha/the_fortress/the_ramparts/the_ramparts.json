The necessity for a bit of gear means that you'll likely never have to wait for this one.\n\nThe Ramparts are immediately right of the popular Plum Wall, and Dad's Army Strikes is the leftmost route on the wall. The begininng is just left of a scruffy bush/tree, and the route roughly follows a buttress at the left side of the wall. For reference, the rightmost route on Plum Wall is just a few metres to the left of Dad's Army Strikes.\nMostly bolted, a very small amount of gear is needed in two sections. I placed a red and a green alien in these places. The climb is a bit runout near the top where the climbing is easy."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"oiJ4jPwgUaqHh9elgHAlzg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.56779,49.43607]}},"createdBy":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ==","_change":{"user":"iI3xOPUnUd6o7f7FUl2xvQ==","historyId":"64140db6f0cf0083295f4ff3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:50:30.832Z"},{"_id":"EbE0nkGFRPqazLe3pv4Ldg==","name":"Obnoxious Little Military Men","grades":{"yds":"5.11"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","content":{"description":"Gets easier after the horizontal\n\nSport"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"oiJ4jPwgUaqHh9elgHAlzg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.56779,49.43607]}},"createdBy":"uVZoOWODXk+cfMEM8GCEug==","_change":{"user":"uVZoOWODXk+cfMEM8GCEug==","historyId":"64140db7f0cf0083295f4ffd","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:50:31.345Z"},{"_id":"ax2rXIOdRcyKeD7i8tT/Pw==","name":"Storming the Ramparts","grades":{"yds":"5.10b"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","content":{"description":"Begin roughly in the centre of the wall and climb a blocky rail (gear) up and right.
