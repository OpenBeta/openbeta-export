This route is a MUST DO for anyone who is solid at hard 5.10, low 5.11 climbing. Long, technical, and loaded with mid to hard 5.10 cruxes, this route just keeps coming at you.  \n  \n Located in the Corridor at the Fortress, this route starts under a black water streaked roof system by a big tree. It stays left of the corner, heading up through the black streak, then stays left of the obvious anchor out right (you'll want to clip this with a long runner, and you do rappel off of it), then heads left up to a high bolt, and romps up through extremely technical terrain straight to the top of the wall and a good belay ledge. Two rappels are required to get back down, unless you trail a line. This route is not to be missed, easily one of the best climbs in the area.\n\nIn The Corridor at The Fortress, just right of a huge tree, left of a small corner.
