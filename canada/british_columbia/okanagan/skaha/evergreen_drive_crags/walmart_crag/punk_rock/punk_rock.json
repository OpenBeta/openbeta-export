Then navigate a small overlap and clip the fifth bolt before turning the left corner and stemming across the gap. Take a rest and sort out the next sequence, that isn’t so bad once you figure out how to pull back onto the wall. You will feel like you are too far left of the fifth bolt until you pull on and commit to the moves that aren’t so hard as they are scary. The final three bolts follow great climbing bringing you back onto the front face and ending with a hard mantle at the chains.\nVaried and really interesting.
