New guidebook pictures are spot on.\n\nP1: 5.10b. Start up a corner with fun stemming leading to an intimidating looking roof/undercling out right and up. After the roof climb up the corner until arriving at the belay on your right. Quality pitch. Gear to #3BD C4\n\nP2: 5.10c. Trending up and slightly right from the belay. Do not continue up the same corner system as P1. \n\nHike to the center of the feature, into a shady nook with two obvious corners, slow pitch is the one on the left. The right hand one has a bolt at the buldge. Once you think you've found it, look around the corner to the left for a sport route (12a) to make sure.\nGear to 3\".
