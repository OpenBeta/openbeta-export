You can do this separately, but its fine and easy to just link into Salvation, which starts on top of the pillar.  \n  \n Pull onto the wall and clip the very closely spaced bolts from good holds - power through a few small cruxes, clipping more bolts. The sting at the top is the redpoint crux for sure, as the final hold is guarded by either insanely small crimps, or a very powerful lunge, depending on your proclivities.  \n  \n A fine route that is well worth doing and projecting, as it is very easy to dog up and project.\n\nThe first climb left of the huge crack feature.\n14 bolts, anchor.
