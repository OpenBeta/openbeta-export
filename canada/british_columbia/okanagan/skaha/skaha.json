As one of the only dry deserts in Canada, a visit here could change your image of the Great White North.\n\nSkaha has a bit of everything, but it's primarily known for its abundance of moderate sport climbs. Despite this reputation, there are some excellent trad lines here as well.Â  With over 50 crags, the climbing is extensive. The grades range from 5.0 to 5.13, with a plethora of 5.10 to 5.12 routes to choose from. You'll find a reasonable selection easier climbs as well. The rock is Gneiss and crisp edges are the bread-and-butter holds. Vertical is the predominant angle but you'll find it tipping in either direction to suit your taste.\n\nThe season runs from March to October or November. As with most places it's possible to get lucky at other times, but it's usually cold and snowy in the winter. In the summer, you'll have to take a midday siesta to escape the heat.\n\nSkaha access issues were solved in 2009 after local climbers, businesses, and partners fundraised their way to a new paved road, parking lots, and BC Provincial Park status. Parking is free, but there is no camping in the Park.\n\nThe South Okanagan is a special place. Its plant and animal communities are diverse and unique, and many are threatened. Over 40 percent of the province's at-risk species are in this region. Please take care to stick to the trails and not disturb the wildlife.\n\nNew routes and updates: [Skaha Bluffs Parkwatch](http://www.skahabluffsparkwatch.com/newroutes-upgrades.html)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"64438b80fbd9321d482bb2f3","prevHistoryId":"64438b17fbd9321d482bb1fd","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":12,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T23:24:31.543Z","updatedAt":"2023-04-22T07:23:58.793Z","updatedBy":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw=="}
