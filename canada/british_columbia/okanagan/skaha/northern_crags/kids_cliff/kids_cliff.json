The typical positive edges found on a lot of the rock at Skaha seem to have not found their way here, or at least those similar edges are more worn down and weathered which tends to make these climbs feel a bit tricky. There are some steeper sections of climbing, but lower angle features dominate. There is an array of 5.9 and 5.10 climbing to be found here, plus a couple harder 5.11 and 5.12 climbs for those fans of thin, technical, and devious hard routes. All of the climbs are around 20 metres in length. \n  \n Kid's Cliff is a little bit out of the way but is still on the main loop trail around the Skaha conservation area. From what I understand, before the previous parking area was developed there used to be a main access trail coming in from this direction and at that time this crag saw a lot more activity."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140eb3f0cf0083295f5ada","prevHistoryId":"64140eb3f0cf0083295f5ad0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":9,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:54:37.949Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:50.224Z","updatedBy":"gjFfcjL7XGiaIgm45ssjFA=="}
