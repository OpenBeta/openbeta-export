It has three main areas - The Terraces, Tottering Pillar, and The Belfry - which boast a number of classic moderate and moderate-hard climbs. The easiest climbs are at the Terraces and the hardest are at the steep, gym-like Belfry. There are walls on both sides of the canyon, so you can avoid sun as you please. Enjoy this wonderful group of crags!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140fe5f0cf0083295f691e","prevHistoryId":"64140fdcf0cf0083295f688b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:59:16.711Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:11.897Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
