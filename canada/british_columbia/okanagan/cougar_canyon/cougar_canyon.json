The rock in Cougar Canyon is Shushwap Gneiss with a more grainy and loose quality than that found near Skaha. With cleaning, unique features and holds are discovered, revealing a texture and variety that makes for climbing that might even be more interesting than Skaha. \n  \n This area is mentioned in the BC Interior Rock guidebook but has seen so much development since its publication that the book really only serves to get you there.  A more up-to-date document is available at Valhalla Pure in Vernon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140d02f0cf0083295f47d0","prevHistoryId":"64140cfdf0cf0083295f4783","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:47:05.574Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:17.110Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
