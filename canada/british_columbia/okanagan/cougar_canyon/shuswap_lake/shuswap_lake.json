Be sure to test most of the holds in case they break off. Lots of dirt on the route, easily brushed out.Â \n\nStart with a good left foot, left hand right above that, right hand far out right in a pocket. Move left. After a solid left-hand undercling, reach out left and begin climbing upwards. I've found a good high left foot allows you to get to the top.\n\n\n\nOn private property - 3610 Blind Bay Road. I rented out the place to be close to the lake, found a nice slab of rock/shale on the side. Was able to create a traverse.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"W3blN5ysU9eInZlfFbbasQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.29729,50.92868]}},"createdBy":"YjkiACQeVWmJFPPOuuMOcw==","_change":{"user":"YjkiACQeVWmJFPPOuuMOcw==","historyId":"64140d04f0cf0083295f47e1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:47:32.847Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,afa002b9-328b-5368-8ddf-ac6d1a1c5f5c,6fa2edcd-7f80-5df5-8621-c8ebf1afdcf4,5b76e537-9cac-53d7-889d-995f15b6dab1","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Okanagan","Cougar Canyon","Shuswap Lake"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"v2"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.29729,50.92868]},"bbox":[-119.2980034210114,50.92823033981814,-119.2965765789886,50.92912966018188],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"W3blN5ysU9eInZlfFbbasQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.2980034210114,50.92823033981814],[-119.2965765789886,50.92823033981814],[-119.2965765789886,50.92912966018188],[-119.2980034210114,50.92912966018188],[-119.2980034210114,50.92823033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Sunny in the morning, then in shade by the house/hill in the afternoon onwards.
