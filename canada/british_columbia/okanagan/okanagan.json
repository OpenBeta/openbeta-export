Its location between the coastal ranges and the Rockies gives it a dry climate often referred to as Canada's only dry desert.  Indeed, with fifty or more wineries, rattlesnakes and scrublands, you won't feel like you're in the Canada you thought you knew all about. \n  \n The climbing is dominated by Skaha, and rightfully so as it's a phenomenal concentration of fine climbing, but there are other worthwhile destinations to be found  such as Kelowna Crags and Cougar canyon. \n  \n This is a tourist area so accommodation ranging from camping to luxury resorts can be found.  Every food niche can be found, from small-town greasy spoons to fine dining.  Rest day and rainy day activities include watersports, hiking and wine-tasting.  The big mountain ranges to the east and to the west aren't too far off either."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414104ff0cf0083295f6e4b","prevHistoryId":"6414104af0cf0083295f6e12","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":17,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T23:23:53.251Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:55.330Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
