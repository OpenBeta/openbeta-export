It is believed that this 1950 ascent was the 2nd ascent of the mountain, the first having been done by Palmer 38 years before.  Later, in 1958 Andy Kaufman and his partner Pete Schoning ( he of THE belay on K2 in 1953 ) became the only two \"Americans\" to do a first ascent of an 8000 meter peak. \n\nIn 1970 a very strong party (Chris Jones, Gary Culver, and Graham Thompson) would climb the impressive lower buttress of the North Ridge and connect to the Kaufman Route. [ 5.7  Route # 422, pg 296 \"Integral North Ridge\" in Jones.  \n\nIf one reads the description of the Kaufman route by Andy in either American Alpine Journal or Appalachia there is much made of a chimney/crack that sounds positively un-inviting. This variation avoids said chimney.  \n\nThe following description was written at the time (1977) and is presented here: \n\nSee \"Getting There\" - Climb the Turret glacier to above the Kaufman gully-ramp. This puts you above the prominent (triangular) snow patch on the ridge.\n\nP1 - Cross the 'shrund and move up to rocks (80 ft / 27m) above the 'shrund. Easy ice  [ We initially probed a smaller snow ramp below our chosen ramp, but the lower ramp \"petered out\".] \n\nP2 - Move upwards on the ice/snow along the rock of the N Ridge to a larger ramp (Photo 1) .  We belayed above the ramp (see Photo 2) and then climbed down/across to the ramp.  Easy Ice\n\nPitches 3 - 8 Easily along the ramp, step around a corner (5.3-5.4) and then several rope lengths left along the ramp with occasional step-across type moves of 5.2 to 5.4.  We avoided going up the face on any of the inviting-looking crack/corner systems we passed.  See Topo Photo  [NOTE- pitch lengths not recorded, but likely to have been short. When I see a good, natural belay I tend to stop.]\n\nP9 &amp; 10 - Class 3 (OK, we were roped, so I guess \"Class 4\") up ridge 150 ft to a step of freshly fractured rock. P10 Here I went right onto the face (5.4 +/- using a 2-inch piece to protect) then back to the ridge crest. This pitch involved some route finding to select the easiest way. There were several \"harder variations\" which involved backing down to find/return to the easiest way. Consideration should be given to tackling the step directly. \n\nP 11 - Up the obvious crack in steepening friction 5.5 to a beautiful, sheltered belay, an excellent spot for \"second breakfast\". 1-inch to 2-inch gear useful. \n\nP 12 &amp; 13 - Up snow/ice  A large piece useful as a running belay near the top of P12 \n\nP 14 +  Walk along lessening angle snow to the summit.\n\nDescent - We climbed this as part of an Adamant-Turret-Austerity traverse, and one can not say too much about how nice this continuation is. It might be best for at least one of the party to be familiar with the descent from Austerity to the Austerity-Ironman col. \n\nIf just climbing Adamant, much of the route could be down climbed, and it is possible that a rappel or two (or 3 or 4) would cut out most of the long diagonal ramp, going directly from the top of technical of climbing to a point on the \"ramp\".    FYI the 1970 Jones party rapped.\n\nAnother possibility is to descend to the Adamant-Turret col and rap down the steep ice/snow, over the bergshrund and onto the upper Turret glacier and then descend that. However, this is a steep and highly crevassed glacier. \n\n\n\nFrom Fairy Meadow ascend the Granite glacier to the Turret glacier.  Depending on crevasses and ice falls, enter the Turret glacier on either side of the nunatuck and then continue (or move to) the left side, ascending next to the north ridge of Adamant. \n\nThe Kaufman route branches off left \"under a prominent triangular snow patch\".

( That being said, the only crevasse I’ve ever fallen into was in the lower, “flatter” part of the glacier returning to Fairy Meadow on this route.) \n\nThe final snow/ice slope up to the Ironman-Austerity col is steep. A friend of mine measured it at 45-degrees.Be aware of its avalanche potential, especially “saturation slides” in the afternoon if it has been in the sun all day while you climb up, and down, the rock ridge to the summit. \n\nMost parties will take the whole, long (10 - 14 hrs) day for a round trip from Fairy Meadow to the summit of Austerity, especially if they are route-finding through the crevasses in the Austerity-Ironman basin. (vs following tracks)\n\nHistory - The FA party (1911) took a convoluted route from Sir Sandford area (where they were camped) to the Ironman-Austerity col. Jones describes it well on page 287 if for any reason you might want to repeat it. (It doesn't sound too inviting, and I doubt its had a second ascent.)  In 1948 Hendricks, camped at Fairy Meadow, pioneered the current route to the col. Both variants climb the last section of West ridge from the col to the summit.\n\nOn a personal note, the first time I was on this route was in 1967 when we climbed the East Face of Austerity and were to descend this \"std\" route.  Two of our party had climbed up it just a few days before, but as the wind and cloud howled on the summit they didn't know which way to start down!  I had just led the team up 5-7 pitches of previously unclimbed rock (from the top of the East snowfield to the ridge, then up the ridge) and, to put it mildly, these \"memory lapses\" were \"not in the plan\".  In due time, after several conferences, we started down.  \n\nRoute - From Fairy Meadow, take the path up the moraine to the Granite Glacier. Pass below Pioneer and Adamant on the relatively flat ( but not without crevasses ! ) glacier.  Pass below the lower reaches of the northeast ridge of Austerity, and somewhere below the northwest ridge start picking your way through crevasses (photos) to gain the basin formed by the northwest ridge of Austerity and the north ridge of Ironman.\n\nClimb up the basin.  Most will probably establish a belay at/just above the bergshrund ( ice screws) Climb the steep slope above the ‘shrund. I can’t remember how long the slope is, but think it’s two long (50m) pitches to where one can establish a rock belay, then another easy pitch of snow or ice to the col.\n\nFrom the col the usual route is first a bit to the left (north) of the ridge crest, climbing back to West ridge proper via snow, easy ice, or rock depending on conditions, (see photo) and climb easy rock ( 5.0 - 5.4 ) to the summit. Again, I forget exactly how many pitches, and we simul-climbed some. I’d guess 4-5 pitches.\n\nDecent- A short ( 100 - 120 ft ) rope might be useful for quick raps over the short ( 20 - 40 ft) steeper “steps” where you might not want to downclimb. The rock on the ridge is generally too low an angle, and too broken up, to rap any distance. ( and to pull the ropes without their catching on something! ) Mostly downclimb the rock.\n\n  The steep snow/ ice slope can be rapped or down- climbed, depending on experience. It is also possible to (simul ?)-downclimb along the snow-rock interface of the north ridge of Ironman. When I did this in 1979 we found good nut placements per “pitch”. The only drawback is that to get back into the basin you have to cross the bergshrund from above without being able to scout it from below.\n     \n\n\n\nsee description \n\nan alpine rack of a few long ice screws and rock gear.

Then, according to Putnam they climbed up about 30 ft, then traversed to the west face then continued to the summit. This is the route we took.   \n\n However, according to Jones [page 335] ,  the 1953 route climbed the west face, really the west face of Gog, and then traversed to their left at about the level of the notch to the west face of Magog and thence to the summit.  I know Jones did a through research job on his guide, and at least McCarthy was (and is) still alive to comment, as may be others, so I would tend to lend a bit more credence to his route description. That being said, the route on the East up to the notch and then along the west face is just really obvious! \n\nJones describes [ page 336] the \"East Face\" route.

Factor, H. Microys, T. Maryon) followed our route almost to the notch, then branched right on a more difficult face (\"steep, slightly overhanging...\") before the actual notch.

Go through/around the notch to the west face ( Check out the \"letter box\", photo)  and then traverse left to a comfortable belay below a wide crack / narrow chimney. Due to rope drag through the notch this may be done as 2 pitches.  \n\nPitch 2 - Climb up to a wide crack ( photos, crux 5.6?); up this then up and left to the summit. Whether the 1953 party climbed the wide crack is not known.  Jones [ pg 335 ] states the 1953 party climbed \" a short, steep pitch (10m) to a ledge....traverse left...and [then] climb easy rock to summit.\"  Jones then continues with an alternate of a \"chossy gully\" but again he speaks of this being on the west side of the formation. \n\nDescent - I understand there is/was a rap anchor for a 50-60m free rappel from the summit, but in 1977 we descended by rapping the west face to the belay ledge, then rapping down P1.\n\n\n\nSee description for the approach \n\n\nStd rack.

Belay in the crack about 20 ft higher.  \n Continue in the crack 15-20 ft, then step left again to a thinner crack, up this (A-1) to a belay at the top of a flake.  \n  [ Today's longer ropes will reduce # of pitches]  \n  \n At this point the FA party traversed right for a rope length, then continued right, and up, to join the regular south ridge route.  \n  \n In 2003 Atkins, Jones, &amp; Seagram climbed a different line (5.10) slightly to the right of the \"Cross-Hall\", then crossed our traverse-line and continued up the headwall \"in a series of cracks and corners directly to the summit (5.8+) \n  \n Jones shows two other routes on this face to the left of the \"Cross-Hall\", plus many other routes further left on the West Face of the Main Peak of Quadrant.\n\nStandard Rack"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"8FdaEIq4XSK+Qwsxql+qmw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.91557,51.73467]}},"createdBy":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","_change":{"user":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","historyId":"64134a33f0cf0083295db95f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-16T16:56:19.204Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,e4cc29dc-cf35-576d-bca6-5e50a4e36d90,f0575a10-8ab8-5d22-be43-0b31aa5faa9b","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","The Adamants","North Faces (from Fairy Meadow)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"},{"count":5,"label":"5.4"},{"count":5,"label":"Unknown"},{"count":4,"label":"5.7"},{"count":3,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":19,"bands":{"unknown":5,"beginner":14,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":19,"bands":{"unknown":5,"beginner":14,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":6,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":4,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":4,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":3,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":5,"beginner":14,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.91557,51.73467]},"bbox":[-117.91629607338017,51.73422033981814,-117.91484392661981,51.73511966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"8FdaEIq4XSK+Qwsxql+qmw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.91629607338017,51.73422033981814],[-117.91484392661981,51.73422033981814],[-117.91484392661981,51.73511966018187],[-117.91629607338017,51.73511966018187],[-117.91629607338017,51.73422033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This area covers the peaks and routes that form the huge cirque of the Granite Glacier that drains into Swan Creek.  Most routes would normally be climbed from a base camp at the ACC's Fairy Meadow (\"William Putnam\") cabin, up to Friendship Col. \n\nThe routes will be organized ROUGHLY in a clockwise ( L &gt; R) direction as “ viewed” by someone standing at the Fairy Meadow Cabin looking towards Friendship Col, starting with the Northwest ridge of Outpost at about 10 o’ clock.

Three things about these ratings: 1) the FA-ers of the day were most generous in naming the routes, so while you may think they started at the very bottom of “ZZZ‘s North Ridge” it is entirely possible they climbed up a snow gully ( now a super choss-pile due to glacial / snow recession) and did the last 500 ft of the ridge. In short, the FA-ers may have just climbed around that hard move you're staring at!  2) Remember, class 4 and 3 are techniques, not levels of difficulty. I encountered this on one of the traverses (not sure which, maybe Outpost to Quadrant) where we were happily scrambling class 3, and my partner (a European-experienced Alpinist) scrambled up a chimney-crack and I just stopped, asked for a rope, then climbed up the 25-30 ft of 5.6 - 5.7 !
