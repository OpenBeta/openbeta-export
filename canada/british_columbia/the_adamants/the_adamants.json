The sheer granite faces of the Adamant peaks are among the most impressive in British Columbia. The rock is comparable to that in the Bugaboo and Vowell groups of the Purcells. The Adamants combine remote access, superb rock climbing and big-walling, challenging glaciers, and excellent snow and ice routes. The west side of the Adamants is particularly of interest to the alpinist for the substantial walls of the Austerity Glacier and Horn/Unicorn Basin.\n\nNote- Many of the photos have been moved to their appropriate sub-area: Adamants North Faces, Gothics neve or Adamants South and West Faces.\n\n\nThe Adamant massif is in the Northern Selkirk mountains, north of Revelstoke B.C.
