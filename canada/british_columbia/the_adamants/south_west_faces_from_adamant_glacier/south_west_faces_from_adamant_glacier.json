From here climb up 5 meters and begin to traverse to the right around the corner out of view. The first pitch is out of view around the corner/edge and careful, difficult stepping across gets you to this crack....a 40 meter splitter that the guide book calls 5.9, but is probably .10+(photo with my bare foot)\n\nThe route continues in a right facing corner with additional vertical cracks on the right to a prominent ledge. This pitch was significantly shorter and easier than the 1st. Once at the ledge, relocate the belay ~5m to the left (NNW) below an obvious set of discontinuous cracks angling up and left. Ascend these cracks to a prominent hanging flake and some fixed gear. A thrutchy section leads to a steep, but easy overlap and the top of the first \"tower.\"\n\nSome walking and 150m of easy, rambling mid-fifth with the occasional step leads to a very thin crack at a headwall.\n\nAscend the thin crack(.10+), which is not as difficult as it looks, to a slabby belay on the crest at some more fixed gear.\n\nTraverse right to the south side to a hidden crack and up a steep and very exposed crack.

We placed a Lost Arrow in the corner and made one french free move (A0) to regain the the crack above. This could be freed with some difficult stemming in the awkward corner. Continue up the corner past a bulge to a sloping ledge after 25m.\n\nPitch four climbs up the steepening crack through a bulge via an overhanging handcrack (10+) that leads to a clean hand and finger crack on the face above (5.10). An excellent pitch that ends on a good ledge after 30m. \n\nPitch five moves right to the widening left facing corner that starts as a thin hands crack and ends as a squeeze chimney (5.9).

Aspiring ascensionists should see David Jones' book \"Selkirks North\" by Elaho Publishing for a complete description.  \n  \n We did this route all free in a day during August 2007 with a new variation on the lower tower. The first ascensionists gave it 5.10+ A1 and did the route over two days from a basecamp below the South Buttress of Ironman, free climbing all but one move by the second bolt. David Lussier and partner got the first free ascent during the second ascent, grading it 5.11a. Ours was the third all-free, one-day ascent, and likely the fourth ascent overall. \n  \n Three distinct \"towers\" or steps comprise this route. The route stays almost entirely on the crest, save a bit near the top of the first tower that wanders around to the north.  \n  \n The first tower has the best splitters on the entire route and a difficult, long corner will likely be the crux for most. \n  \n The second tower is very steep and has lots of loose and dangerous rock. There was likely a major rock-fall here in the recent past. The climbing is still very good and physical, albeit a bit heads-up. \n  \n The third and final tower ascends directly on the crest and features some spectacularly exposed knife edge climbing to a traverse under a massive roof and some easier fifth to the summit. \n  \n This route is stunningly classic and I'd give it four stars if not for the shattered rock on the second tower.\n\nThe Route ascends the prominent buttress of the Horn. Start up a large gash/chimney on the right side of the lower part of the toe of the buttress. Ascend the gash to a large vegetated ledge to the true start of the route.  <br />  <br /> To descend from the summit (Depending on where your camp is you will have several options) descend to the east with one or two short raps. For a camp in the Horn/Unicorn Basin(our choice), traverse to the north, tagging the summit of the unicorn and over the other side. Continue along the prominent ridge between the Horn basin and  the Granite Glacier basin. Once to the saddle, descend to the west to the lowest point of a large snow field above a cliff band. Two to three raps and some scrambling down the slabby cliff band will return you to the upper Horn basin below mount Colossal.\nDouble cams from blue alien to #2 Camalot and 1 each of #3 &amp; #4 Camalot.
