The FA party did not climb the \"headwall\" of the rib to the summit but rather traversed the big ledge to the West Ridge (5.8 climbing up to this point). We found solid 5.10 climbing up the upper portion. \n  \n The climbing is a bit varied and route finding a little tricky. Lower down follow bushy ledges on the left side of the ridge. The crest itself seems to provide harder climbing and we had to rap back to the left at one point after a dead end.  \n  \n The upper pitches are spectacular with great views of the real Tupper headwall on the right. \n  \n Plan for a long day car-to-car.\n\nPark at the Hermit Meadows trailhead and walk along highway 1 (east) until reaching the first snow tunnel. Follow the faint road to above the snow tunnel and ascend the obvious couloir to the start of the route.  <br />  <br /> Descend the West Ridge back to the Hermit Meadows bivy site and follow the trail back to the road.\nStandard alpine rack to 3'' and single rope."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"AjtFWz0+XdyB1tZeEI4Ocw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.49667,51.33666]}},"createdBy":"j1VUFLbMUHGyMqov2xQUag==","_change":{"user":"j1VUFLbMUHGyMqov2xQUag==","historyId":"6414117cf0cf0083295f79fa","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:06:36.980Z"},{"_id":"5ukRnwh1T2ewM302I2v/Jg==","name":"West Ridge","grades":{"yds":"5.3"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Wolfgang Koehler, Edward Feuz Jr, Gottfried Feuz, 1906","content":{"description":"This climb is mainly 4th class scrambling with three distinct cruxes that can all be done at no harder than 5.3. After navigating one's way to the large Hermit gendarme along the ridge, move out right (there was another belay anchor here, not included in the descent discussion) onto a somewhat exposed traverse for one pitch. Follow broken ledges up and right as high as you can on scrambling terrain until you have to surmount an obvious left facing corner. The corner crack and chimney slightly right of the corner crack offer the easiest options (5.3) yet still the technical crux. Crack climbing on the face left of the crack is another option at a slightly higher grade. More scrambling to the final summit block leads to an airy arete finish and the large flat summit. Descend the route. Pay attention to rap station locations on the way up as they can be somewhat hidden on the way back down.\n\nFrom Hermit Meadows follow cairns and faint trails to the Tupper shoulder, above the Tupper glacier. The obvious West Ridge snakes down and connects to the shoulder with a rough beaten single track until boulder scrambling starts.\nAll trad. Three fixed rappel chain anchors, and three more slung blocks with maillons (Aug 2017)."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"AjtFWz0+XdyB1tZeEI4Ocw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.49667,51.33666]}},"createdBy":"5KaCoMsnXsOkQEFV/7XITw==","_change":{"user":"5KaCoMsnXsOkQEFV/7XITw==","historyId":"6414117df0cf0083295f7a04","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:06:38.026Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,41b77821-3cb2-5b47-b45f-331fa4956bb4,023b455b-3d3e-5ddc-81d6-d65e108e0e73","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Rogers Pass","Mount Tupper"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.3"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.49667,51.33666]},"bbox":[-117.49738975204617,51.336210339818145,-117.49595024795379,51.33710966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"AjtFWz0+XdyB1tZeEI4Ocw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.49738975204617,51.336210339818145],[-117.49595024795379,51.336210339818145],[-117.49595024795379,51.33710966018186],[-117.49738975204617,51.33710966018186],[-117.49738975204617,51.336210339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"Mount Tupper towers over highway 1 in Rogers Pass and features a number of exciting routes on good quality quartzite."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414117df0cf0083295f7a04","prevHistoryId":"6414117cf0cf0083295f79fa","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:06:33.003Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:55.937Z","updatedBy":"j1VUFLbMUHGyMqov2xQUag=="}
