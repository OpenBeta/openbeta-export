No fixed anchors or belays . Compact quartzite. Protection is there where you need it . Belays are to be found on a series of terraces corresponding with 45m-60m rope lengths.\nRoute finding is straightforward due to nature and extent of the buttress feature.\nSee photos.\nApproach via Asulkan hut trail , exit at toe of moraine , cross braided creek and trend NW across next moraine , broken ground , slabs. Stay on top of obvious ‘twin moraines ‘ to gain polished slabs trending towards obvious buttress toe. Aim for the first ‘step’ , avoiding lower broken steps nad ground. \nRoute starts at top of loose gully ( stay right to avoid nasty loose blocks ). \n\nP1: 45m 5.7 Centre of buttress. Ascend obvious cracks and steps trending left to belay at tree snag.\nP2: 50m 5.8 Climb straight up staying left of obvious white rock. Stay right side of steep broken right facing feature exiting at overlap to face above. Belay on terrace.\nP3: 45m 5.7 Climb left side of face to find protection , step right girth hitch the horizontal ‘Cadbury flake’ and continue upward to belay terrace. Spectacular view of Dome &amp; Asulkan range to the south.\nP4: 55m 5.8 Nice left facing corner system takes good cams, layback &amp; jam exiting on easier ground to next belay terrace.\nP5: 40m 5.8 Continue up right of buttress centre on easy 5th to stunning views of the Rampart arete , trend up and left of the arete on ledges to base of vertical crack . Crack ends on blank face, delicate face move to next belay terrace.\nP6: 45m 5.7 Broken ground and easy 5th with the odd 5.7 move. Scramble short distance on loose ground to toe of next face (plumbline below obvious rock outcrop up high as reference for belay).\nP7 40m 5.7 climb left side of the face for protection stepping back onto the face and below the outcrop , climb on right side of outcrop and upwards to gain the mountain summit , metres from the actual high point cairn ! Jaw dropping views on all sides .\n\nDescent :\n\nReturn to vehicle via low 5th and 4th class ridges along Mount Afton and Abbott to gain the Abbott trail proper. ( Reversing the Asulkan traverse day 1 route). \nThis takes time and heads-up down climbing . \n\nNo water enroute . \n\n5hrs from vehicle to buttress base.\n\n3hrs for the roped ascent.\n\n5hrs for the descent. \n\nGaia route in full detail under route name . \n\n\n\nRogers pass. <br />Illecillewaet Campground for day parking . Parking Permits required. \n\nNo bolts . Single rack to 3” . Long slings . We used 2 half 60m ropes .
