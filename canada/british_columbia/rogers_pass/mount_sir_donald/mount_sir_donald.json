Fynn, August 19, 1909","length":727,"content":{"description":"This is one of best long moderate rock routes anywhere.  Inclusion in the Fifty Classics was well warranted, but certainly hasn't made it crowded.  When we did it, we were the first in eight days according to the summit register and the weather had been great for weeks.  A bear-related closure of the approach trail might have  had something to do with it though. \n  \n Many people bivy just below the Sir Donald-Uto col, but the hike can be done in under three hours, so you can time it to reach the route at sunrise, and do the route car-to-car.  Trying to start up the route itself before sunrise, by headlamp, probably isn't worth it. \n  \n Describing the route is pretty easy: once at the Sir Donald-Uto col, you head up the ridge, and you  don't leave the ridge until you're at the summit.  \n  \n If you deviate from the ridge by more than five or ten feet thinking it will be easier, you'll probably find yourself heading back to the ridge.  Most of the climbing is 4th class, but there are regular sections of 5th, and depending on conditions there may be pockets of snow to avoid that could up the grade.  Sticky approach shoes or even boots would be good for many people.  We chose comfy rock shoes and appreciated the extra margin, but carrying approach shoes would be wise, especially if you use the rappel descent. \n  \n In the final few hundred feet the angle eases and there's more choice for deviating off the ridge, on to the west face, but you won't go wrong by still sticking with the ridge. \n  \n A common warning regarding the peak is that the rock gets unusually slick if it gets wet, so plan your ascent accordingly, be very alert to the weather, and very careful if it does get wet. \n  \n To descend, reversing the route is probably best.  Most of the downclimbing is fairly straightforward.  A few short rappels can help, but rappelling down a ridge is inherently difficult as you get forced down the face.  About 2/3 of the way down you will see shiny bolted rappel anchors (watch for them on the way up).  These mark the start of a rappel route that allows you to avoid downclimbing the first third of the route.  It involves 12 or so 25m rappels.  There is some ledge scrambling required between, but in the daylight it's fairly obvious; by headlamp it's quite difficult. \n  \n A variation on the descent is to head down the northeast ridge until a big ledge system allows to cross the entire west face to arrive back at the northwest ridge and continue down from there.  We tried this, but didn't like the uncertainty about where to start traversing and ended up climbing back up to the summit and just going down the route.  This ledge may require an ice axe, which may be difficult to determine before doing the route, so I suspect this descent doesn't get done as often as just reversing the route. \n  \n A final note, as with most big routes, search out more information than just this description.  Several guidebooks have good descriptions and photos. \n  \n Sorry about not including any pictures, we had camera difficulties.\n\nUnless you plan to solo up and then downclimb, a rope will be necessary, and even if you do plan to solo the entire thing, a skinny rope that you can rappel would be wise in case of wet weather. <br />  <br /> If you plan to simulclimb, a small rack of nuts and a selection of cams up to hand size will be good.  Pitching it out is virtually impossible unless you plan to bivy -- this is a very long route!"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"T/bqO6ceWKu2eG4kf9uKQA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.4325,51.2632]}},"createdBy":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg==","_change":{"user":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg==","historyId":"64141178f0cf0083295f79d2","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:06:32.025Z"},{"_id":"Ba/YkcxuR5yInd6LSIr6XA==","name":"Uto Peak Southwest Ridge","grades":{"yds":"5.0"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Van Santvoord Merle-Smith, Ernest Feuz, Jul 31, 1911","length":394,"content":{"description":"Uto Peak's SW ridge is the little brother to Sir Donald's more famous NW ridge. It starts in the same place and it's very similar climbing on sound, blocky quartzite, but only half as long (400m ascent from the col). It's a good alternative if the weather is dubious, or for novice alpinists who're not sure about getting up and down Sir Donald in a day. \n  \n The climb stays close to the ridge crest or slightly to its left. It's mostly 3rd- and 4th-class scrambling with a few low 5th-class steps. The guidebooks call it \"5.1\" but it's old-fashioned 5.1.\n\nStart from the Uto-Sir Donald col. Climb up the ridge. Stop at the summit. <br />  <br /> There are a couple of ways to descend: <br />  <br /> 1. Reverse the route. There are several rap stations, but as of 2016 the slings were quite faded. The main advantage of descending this way is if you've left anything at the Uto-Sir Donald col. Beware of the rodents of unusual size if you leave anything at the col. <br />  <br /> 2. Most people will find it easier to descend Uto's NW ridge. It's almost all 3rd class or easier. Stay on the ridge crest with occasional detours to the left (facing down). There are one or two steeper steps where it's possible to rappel, but the downclimbing is nowhere harder than 4th class if you take the easiest line. When you reach the Uto-Avalanche col turn left (south) and head down a gully (snow or loose scree) towards the Sir Donald bivouac. Some people have headed down too soon and found themselves in a gully that cliffs out. From the top of the correct gully you can see the whole way down.\nIf you're not a confident 5.7 leader then bring a rope and a light rack. In early season an ice-axe may be useful for snow slopes on the approach and descent."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"T/bqO6ceWKu2eG4kf9uKQA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.4325,51.2632]}},"createdBy":"4iskQriFVzCVnR8xgvWkFg==","_change":{"user":"4iskQriFVzCVnR8xgvWkFg==","historyId":"64141178f0cf0083295f79dc","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:06:32.525Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,41b77821-3cb2-5b47-b45f-331fa4956bb4,4ff6ea3b-a71e-58ab-b678-6e247fdb8a40","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Rogers Pass","Mount Sir Donald"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.0"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.4325,51.2632]},"bbox":[-117.43321860111759,51.26275033981814,-117.43178139888244,51.26364966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"T/bqO6ceWKu2eG4kf9uKQA=="},"content":{"description":"Mount Sir Donald is is one of the premier destinations for Mountaineering in BC, especially alpine rock climbing.
