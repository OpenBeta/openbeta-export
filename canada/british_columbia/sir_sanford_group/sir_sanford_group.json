Why did climbers keep choosing the obviously dangerous lower Hourglass Route?  Probably because of the easier approach from the Great Cairn Hut (approx 6,250'). The Northwest Ridge is a safe way to reach the 50 degree ice pitch of the actual hourglass feature above most of the big ice cliffs.   \n  \n From the hut, traverse to the Sandford Glacier and climb to the junction with the Minaret Col fork of the glacier.  Decide how you want to dodge the crevasses and icefall based on current conditions.  Aim for the Ravelin-Sanford col on the Northwest Ridge, via easy snow.  The col is a possible high bivouac for parties based out of the Great Cairn Hut (approx 8,550').   \n  \n After the col, stay on the crest of the ridge until difficult gendarmes begin blocking the way (approx 9,000'). Avoid the difficult part of the ridge by moving right of the crest (west). Connect ledges for another 500 feet, then traverse left below the next difficult step (approx 9,700'). Staying on the ridge is reported to be as hard as 5.7 on loose marble with sharp crystals (approx 9,000'-9,700'). \n  \n Back on the ridge, below the final difficult rock step, there is a choice of routes to gain the summit slopes &amp; ridge.  Either dodge the rock by a short traverse left to the 50 degree ice of the Hourglass or attack the rock ridge more directly, rotten 5.7 (approx 9,700'-9.900').  \n  \n On the way down, two rappels have been used to descend the 5.7 step, or buttress, on the ridge (approx 9,700'-9,900'). It is also possible  to rappel the hourglass, if conditions are solid. \n  \n The Hourglass ice pitch is the best way, if one can stay close to the rock.  The 'schrund may block access to the Hourglass, forcing a too-long traverse left.  In that case avalanche exposure becomes a bummer. After the Hourglass pitch, look for a gully to regain the ridge (appox 9,900'). \n  \n Climb a relatively easy slope to the summit ridge (approx 11,200').  The final ridge is described in some reports as exposed and fun.  Others have found a serious double-cornice challenge to reach the summit (exactly 11,555').

Seven sub-ranges block access from the Rogers Pass area. To the north, the Adamant Group and three other sub-ranges screen easy viewing of the most impressive and highest summit of British Columbia's Interior Ranges, Mount Sir Sandford (11,580'). The common analogy is 'The Robson of the Interior Ranges'.\n\nNamed after Sir Sandford Flemming, the man who invented time zones in 1884 (David P Jones, Selkirks North, 2001). First climbed in 1912 by bushwhackers extraordinaire Aemmer, Fuez Jr, Holway, and Palmer. This kind of detail would normally be in a route description, but their line is now a serac bowling ally.\n\nThe rock is not the best. Marble, micaceous schist, and phyllite predominate. Sir Sandford is famous for it's sharp but rotten ball-bearing marble. The 1955 first ascent team of Palisade Peak, described unreliable rock that: ...\"resembles an overhanging sand dune.\" Luckily, much of the group is covered by numerous (retreating) glaciers. On the positive side, David Jones states: \"Rockfall is not a big problem, since surface rocks disintegrate into sand as soon as they start moving.\"\n\nJohn Scurlock's Gallery has the best pictures of Mount Sir Sanford.\n\nAPPROACHES\n\nThere are only two recommendable ways to get into Sir Sandford, helicoptering or Moberly Pass.\n\nThere is an outdated and very difficult way third way that crosses the Adamants. Washed out roads and glacial retreat are making the old way less fun. Let's hope the logging roads used to get to near Moberly Pass don't get washed out or decommissioned.\n\nIt is also possible to ‘copter into either Fairy Meadow or Adamant glacier and the hike over to  airy Cabin. ( Then have your ‘copter pick up up there.) In 1967 I did the traverse from Fairy Meadow to Cairn cabin with full packs ( see photos) and it took a day.  \nTwo key points: 1) avoid the swamp of the middle-lower Adamant glacier ( note on the posted map the dotted route diverts from a “ straight shot across”, and 2) be 100% sure of where Azimouth Notch is. My understanding is the wrong notch is quite the descent. (see photo “map 2 of 3” ) The steep, grassy descent from Azimuth notch itself had us wondering if crampons were appropriate on the grass, certainly a thought, especially if the grass is wet. The early explorers had nailed boots!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141504f0cf0083295fa35a","prevHistoryId":"64141504f0cf0083295fa350","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:21:36.789Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:07.577Z","updatedBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw=="}
