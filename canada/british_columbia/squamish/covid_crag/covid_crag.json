The crag is pretty tall and steep, but the many features keep the grades down. The only downside is traffic noise - the crag is pretty close to the highway and you won't be able to hear your belayer once you're past halfway. You are very likely to have the crag to yourself here, which is surprising because there is basically no approach and the climbing is quite interesting.\n\nYou can read the topo here:  https://quickdrawpublications.com/wp-content/uploads/topos/Garibaldi_Covid_Crag.pdf\n\nPark on the north section of Depot Road just east of the highway. Take the bike trail (Wonderland) north for 3 minutes, once you have trees on your left you will start to see the crag on your right."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6415310f135731b69111eee3","prevHistoryId":"6415310e135731b69111eed9","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:22:26.579Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:58.660Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
