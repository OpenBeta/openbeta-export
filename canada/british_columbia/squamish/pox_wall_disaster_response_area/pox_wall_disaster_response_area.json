Climb the crack to the belay ledge.  This pitch doesn't see much sun and is a bit mossy.  The belay bolts are to the left, but look for the rap bolts about 50' to the right and remember to hit those on the way down. 20m pitch. \n  \n P2 - The money pitch.   Take either the left hand/fist crack or the right thin crack.  We took the left crack.   It's steep, solid jamming all the way to the undercling roof.   I had two #3s and one #4.   If you want to sew it up, bring another #4. There is a horizontal crack midway which helps with the gear.  The steep crack just below the crux undercling is #2/#3 camalot size, so save one of each for that section if you want to sew it up.  Bust out the undercling (crux for me) and pull around the roof.  Easy climbing leads to the bolts directly overhead. 25m pitch. \n  \n P3 - Move the belay down and to the right.   Launch up the gently overhanging handcrack for 40 feet (sweetness!) to the bolt protecting a weird step left.   Climb overlaps/underclings to the anchor, which is way up there. 30m pitch. \n  \n Descent:  Rap the route with a 60m route.   Hit the rap anchors about 50' of the belay bolts atop P1.   I almost missed them coming down, so keep your eyes out.\n\nSee area description.  After hiking up you'll end up below the Pox Wall.  Before hitting the wall take a faint trail to the right and follow it for 10 minutes.  The route is pretty far right.\nWe did the fist crack version and a comfortable rack would be double crams from fingers to #3 camalot.  I had one #4 camalot, but two would have sewed it up.   Finger crack version looked like it took good great from small to green camalot."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"sF3n7OZGX0+bOIraJc2AQA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.12987,49.6902]}},"createdBy":"AGL+8ih0VeqNpOO8TawOcQ==","_change":{"user":"AGL+8ih0VeqNpOO8TawOcQ==","historyId":"64141771f0cf0083295fc172","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:32:01.335Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,a354b580-870b-5444-9f11-2c0e78995841,b05de7ec-e646-5f4f-9b38-8ada25cd8040","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Squamish","Pox Wall / Disaster Response Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.12987,49.6902]},"bbox":[-123.13056507826303,49.68975033981814,-123.12917492173695,49.690649660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"sF3n7OZGX0+bOIraJc2AQA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.13056507826303,49.68975033981814],[-123.12917492173695,49.68975033981814],[-123.12917492173695,49.690649660181855],[-123.13056507826303,49.690649660181855],[-123.13056507826303,49.68975033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is a recently developed area between Slhanay/Squaw and the Chief."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141771f0cf0083295fc172","prevHistoryId":"64141770f0cf0083295fc16c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:31:59.364Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:00.146Z","updatedBy":"AGL+8ih0VeqNpOO8TawOcQ=="}
