The crag itself sits just above Howe Sound.  Hanging belays at high tide are not to be missed.  Seals and otters frequent the cove as well.  Out the traverse, best to belay the second from the top and rap back in from the tree.  Two ropes may be needed otherwise, with the real possibilty of dropping them in the water."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641a9d9ff0687d6d493b4f47","prevHistoryId":"6417738a7eb87590e32e17c9","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":19,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T02:47:13.935Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:26.131Z","updatedBy":"dJnoUUlrV5qyrni9MsK+tA=="}
