What's commonly known as Grub Street is a short 11a tips crack from the Lower Ledge to the Midway Ledge, with different options above and below.

This is the first pitch of Aganol.\nP2 - 11a - Head up into the pod and then into a tips crack up to Midway Ledge.\nP3 - 10b - Follow the crack just right of the belay up past bolts on a slab to the base of the Stooges Slab. This pitch is called Sodbusters.\nP4 - 5.9 - Finish on one of the Stooges Slab routes.\n\nP3 Alt - 10c. Go left on Midway Ledge to climb the line at the far left of the wall at 10c, 50m.
