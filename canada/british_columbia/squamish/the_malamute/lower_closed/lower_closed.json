The 11d rating was given by Peter Croft. I tried to free it and fell trying to reach the bolt. Fun and interesting climbing mostly in the 10a/b range.It is a shallow right facing corner. The route leaves the corner heading toward a bolt that is hard to reach. Good face holds after gaining the bolt and left to anchor.\n\nleft of Crescent crack and right of Hand Jive.\nstandard rack to 2\". there are some committing moves on small gear, have extra small cams. If you want to aid to the bolt you may want a yellow alien for the pocket before the 2nd bolt, it would also be the only hold to reach the bolt if freeing the move. I missed the first bolt.
