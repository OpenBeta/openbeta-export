The route can be accessed from below by climbing Berrycup or Crescent Crack but the 'legal' approach involves an easy rap in, which is good if you want to TR or pre-hang some draws.\n\nBegin from an anchor on a slab above Berrycup. Face climb easily and clip a couple bolts to where the wall steepens. Dance up tricky 5.11 to gain the left angling crack, which is well protected and succumbs to balancy laybacking. When the crack peters out, compose yourself and launch into an improbable looking hand traverse on decent edges, but almost nothing to speak of for feet. Crimp along clipping 3 bolts until you reach a dyke crack, and some respite. Finish up a beautiful short tips to fingers splitter which forms the left boundary of a humongous detached flake (it's not going anywhere). Savor the amazing position above Howe Sound and clip the chains.\n\nThis pitch is absolutely classic and deserves a place on more people's ticklist, get on it!\n\n\n\nClimb Berrycup, but keep climbing past the first anchor OR rappel Paul's Crack on Starr Wall, and hike up and right into the forest until you find the edge of the cliff.
