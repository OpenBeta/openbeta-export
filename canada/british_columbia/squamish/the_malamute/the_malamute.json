Although it is invisible from the road, it's considerably larger than you would expect, with routes up to three pitches.  Some very high quality and legendary climbs are here.  There are steep crack testpieces as well as more recent bolted slabs. \n  \n The cliff is divided into a lower and upper section, with a number of the climbs on the Lower Malamute closed due to the CN Rail right-of-way along the tracks at the base of the cliff. \n  \n On most days the Malamute is a windy place, even when the air seems calm on the Chief.  It can be cold in the wind if the cliff is still in the shade (until about 1:00pm, depending on the season), even on a hot day."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641415b9f0cf0083295fab3a","prevHistoryId":"641415b4f0cf0083295fab0b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":11,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T02:57:01.649Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:23:36.805Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
