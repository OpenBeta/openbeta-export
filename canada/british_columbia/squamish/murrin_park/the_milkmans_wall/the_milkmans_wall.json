This is a fairly serious lead and would be an incredible on-sight for someone with the sufficient mental and physical strength.  \n  \n The climbing is typical Milkman wall stuff - slightly over-hanging with some long reaches between good holds. \n Start with hard moves off the deck to a bolt at about 15' (don't fall getting to it).  From the bolt, some more steep crimping takes you slightly left to a jug with good feet.  This is the best rest and allows you to place good gear from a nice stance.  Move up and right through a tough overlap to the Horrors Cave and then back left to a decent rest and another opportunity for gear.  You probably want to double up on the pro at this point since this is all you get.  The next few moves getting established on the head wall are pumpy but all there.  Keep a cool head and continue up on small but positive crimps -  the climbing eases off as you get higher but the run-out will keep your attention\n\nThe route starts just right of Mr. O'Clock (about 10' left of Horrors)\na single rack to 2\" is plenty."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"Us83B/2pXAaCg3a2dbSvMg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.2052,49.6458]}},"createdBy":"si2wh0fLWF+gcVpsqWPuPg==","_change":{"user":"si2wh0fLWF+gcVpsqWPuPg==","historyId":"6414169af0cf0083295fb671","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:28:26.276Z"},{"_id":"cZr6t5tbRtGwoX9fQPMj/g==","name":"Gertrude","grades":{"yds":"5.11c"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Calvin Adams, Colin Moorhead 2011","length":9,"content":{"description":"Quality climbing on steep rock.
