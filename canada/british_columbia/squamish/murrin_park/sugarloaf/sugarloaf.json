very popular crag offers two different faces to the world.  A south side with six routes from 5.4 to 5.8, combined with access to the top and bolted anchors, guarantees that you will not be alone here if you can find  a free climb at all.  A great place to learn to climb or lead trad.  The north side has much harder and more interesting climbing.  Again, the access to the top ensures that there are often top-ropes on these although most are good leads."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641a919dc1c87610c70a567b","prevHistoryId":"641a917ec1c87610c70a5602","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":15,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:29:59.724Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:57.364Z","updatedBy":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg=="}
