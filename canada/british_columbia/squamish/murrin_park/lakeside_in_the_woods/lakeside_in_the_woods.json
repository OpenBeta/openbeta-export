most of the crags at Murrin Park, Lakeside in the Woods faces east and gets filtered, morning sun. The climbing is an eclectic mix, with plenty of easy and moderate climbs and some hard trad test pieces.\n\nAt the south end of the wall are some moderate sport climbs (5.7-10d). The middle of the wall has the hardest climbing, including some very bold climbs: The Gunslinger (13d trad) and The Bull (14a R trad). The north end includes The Reacharound, a fantastic moderate that is included in Marc Bourdon's Top 100 Squamish Climbs.\n\nDirectly across from The Reacharound is the Common Wealth, which contains a number of mainly easier traditionaly protected climbs and is quite popular.\n\nTwo recently developed (2013) nearby crags are Quercus Cliff, which is a few minutes walk along the Murrin Loop trail, and The Valley of the Lost Tribe which is around the right side of the Common Wealth.\n\nDetails on these new crags are available at  quickdrawpublications.com/ .
