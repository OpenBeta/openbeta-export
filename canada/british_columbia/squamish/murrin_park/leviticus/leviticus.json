Start by climbing Leviticus and traverse right into the base of a flare with a sawed of tree stump.  Climb up into the flare where you can place your last pieces of gear before getting into Sixty-Nine. A Grey Alien and green Camalot work well. Climb up and right into a faint seam with crimps on either side. The last few moves before you can get any protection are runout so make sure you have a good belay (or donÂ’t let go).
