It's a shaded area that gets some afternoon sun at the top. It can feel very crowded because even though there are 36 routes on it so far, 3 or 4 routes often share the same start and branch out from there. Routes are fairly steep.\n\nRoute developer: Chris Small, area announced 2019. 60m rope is sufficient for most of the routes, but some do require a 70m rope or lowering/rappelling to intermediate stations to get down."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641416ecf0cf0083295fbb07","prevHistoryId":"641416e9f0cf0083295fbaec","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:29:37.592Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:29:39.291Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
