The variety of climbing is outstanding as there are easy slabs, excellent trad routes at all grades, big overhangs, long vertical sport routes, and testpiece cracks.\n\nMost of the cliffs are east facing making for shaded afternoon climbing on hot days.  Some are secluded enough to make for peaceful days even on busy weekends.  The lake a great place for a dip to cool off at the end of the day."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64226ed431d93a51e2eafa4e","prevHistoryId":"642259ba31d93a51e2eae25f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":32,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T02:56:39.278Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:12.760Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
