Start up a fairly easy corner, a few awkward moves in a flaring crack lead to a beautiful left facing corner crack. \n\nThe trail that takes you to Up Among the Firs pretty much exits in front of a feature called \"The Pie\" as there are cracks that section the face the way a pie would be cut into six pieces.  The right side of this area is bounded by a big left facing corner which hosts this climb.\nMedium nuts and cams will get you through the initial corner and flare.  The upper crack takes hand sized gear, but note that it widens a bit inside, so choose your gear wisely: what enters the crack may tip out once it's inside.
