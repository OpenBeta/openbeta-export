While it's very close to Murrin Park, it's rarely visited due to the stout approach: the distance isn't great, but it's pretty rugged.  The payoff is a beautiful valley, isolated from road noise, cool temperatures on a hot day, and some very nice routes. \n  \n This valley has never been logged and has a Lost World feel.  My partner commented that he half expected pygmies with bones through their noses to shoot poison darts at us while we were there. \n  \n Of the crags in this area, some may be overgrown and lost, but Donny's Roof and The Pillar of Payan, at least, look good.  According to various blogs by local hardpeople, the route Zap Crack (12d crack) has seen a fair number of redpoints in the last few years."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141c30f0cf0083295ffe68","prevHistoryId":"64141c2df0cf0083295ffe43","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:52:02.727Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:17.488Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
