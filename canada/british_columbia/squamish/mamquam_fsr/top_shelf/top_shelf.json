I mean that in the way that Michael Jackson was Bad. Essentially a harder, and better version of the nearby \"Meltdown\". The route follows a twin crack system, but the right \"crack\" is more of just a flare and only usable in a few spots. Make a hard move off the ground and get some good locks and thin, flaring hand jams to a tough move off of a pinch to gain a sloping ledge. Move left on jugs and get a good rest below the thin crack. Place some high pieces and punch it through 20 feet of technical and insecure climbing. Fancy footwork is key to success here as the locks are not that great. Figure out the sequence that works for you and hit the \"thank god\" hand jam! Some pumpy, 5.9 jamming gets you to the anchors.  \n  \n This felt quite a bit harder to me than Sentry Box, but that's just, like, you know, my opinion.\n\nto the left of Eye Catcher, at the top of the fixed line.\nThe gear I used in order was: <br />  <br /> gold BD nut <br /> silver BD nut (big one) <br /> 0.5 camalot <br /> #1 camalot <br /> #1 camalot <br /> red DMM offset nut <br /> blue DMM offset nut <br /> red BD nut <br /> blue BD nut (big one) <br /> yellow metolius <br /> #2 camalot <br /> 0.75 camalot"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"4edapMqrW7CaTZlA+z+SVA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.11425,49.70087]}},"createdBy":"lkeDmuomUgSN7qaS6xSskA==","_change":{"user":"lkeDmuomUgSN7qaS6xSskA==","historyId":"64141625f0cf0083295fb0c8","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:26:29.045Z"},{"_id":"Ac1l7SZER3e5+nua0bivNw==","name":"Maker's Mark","grades":{"yds":"5.11c"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Jon Rigg, Danny Guestrin, Drew Marshall, June 2017","length":45,"content":{"description":"P1 (10a, 20m)\nClimb a finger crack and/or chimney on the left side of a pillar, to a bolted anchor on a spacious belay ledge\n\nP2 (11c, 25m)\nClimb double cracks up the corner, and an airy layback out the roof.

The rock is bomber, the routes are clean, and the lines are aesthetic. My hat goes off to the folks who developed this area, as I'm sure it was no easy task to get this wall to the beautiful condition that it's in. The wall faces northwest and gets shade for most of the day. The base of the wall is very well maintained with logs and flat belay areas. Nearly all of the routes can be climbed with a 60 m rope (always tie knots!), most anchors have fixed draws on them for lowering (don't remove them!), and most folks will want a double set of cams from fingers to wide hands and a #4. It would not be out of the question to bring triples up to a #1 camalot, as many of the routes are so splitter! The only thing lacking at this wall are moderates. Most of the climbs are 5.10 and up, and the grades felt a bit harder than similarly graded climbs in the area. The wall is steeper than it appears, so the climbs tend to be pretty pumpy.\n\nThere are quite a few projects on the wall. Please respect those as the route developer has put a lot of hard work in to the line.\n\nAdditional info can be found at  squamishclimbingsource.word…"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141628f0cf0083295fb10e","prevHistoryId":"64141628f0cf0083295fb104","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":27,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:26:14.377Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:26:32.878Z","updatedBy":"lkeDmuomUgSN7qaS6xSskA=="}
