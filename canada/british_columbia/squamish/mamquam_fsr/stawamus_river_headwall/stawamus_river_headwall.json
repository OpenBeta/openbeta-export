The knowledge of the cliff gained from this FA allowed us to piece together the line that would later become Goldilocks Zone. With a dangerous crux followed by a long and involved traverse there is little to recommend this route. I will enter for the record and to offer future explorers some insight to what has been done on this portion of the wall.  \n\nThe first 4 pitches are pretty much the same as GL Zone. Following the line of weakness lead us up to left side of the arching overhangs that cap the lower wall. The crux involved high quality but dangerous climbing (feel free to add a bolt here) up a shallow corner followed by a long, tedious traverse under the massive arch feature. From here we climbed essentially what would become the finish Goldilocks Zone.\n\n\n\nSee Goldilocks Zone.
