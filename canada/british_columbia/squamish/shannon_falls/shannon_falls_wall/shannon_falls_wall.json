He had placed hex-head rivets from free stances or hooks, requiring wired nuts to be slung over them as pro. A bold, unique style that most can only imagine as much of the stone was likely (even back then) covered in lichen and needed brushing, all while on the sharp end. While never reaching the top of this section of the wall he did indeed find some truly excellent climbing, primarily on dykes, in a picturesque setting and for that we all owe our respect. \n\nThis route has humbly been established using modern top-down tactics, searching for the best free-climbing line with a respect to the style of the wall. As far as locations of bolts, typically they are placed from good stances, and not as often on easier ground.\n\nCarls rusted rivets on the second pitch, part of a climb he called “I Wanna Be Teased”, were replaced one-for-one with modern stainless bolts.

Move right to a good stance, clip a bolt, and pull the bouldery crux on small edges. Continue past a couple more bolts to the anchor. Carl had rated this pitch 11a when he did it in 1984, but a large broken flake stance at the crux has bumped the grade.\n\nPitch 3 (10b, 3 bolts + gear) Climb dykes to the right and link into the “Dark Matter” finger crack. Finish as for that pitch.\n\nPitch 4 (11b, 12 bolts) Climb left along dykes across the wall to an increasingly exposed position above the falls. Sustained movement through amazing small pockets and edges on the face above lead to the top.

A mix of different styles and difficulties.\n\nThis could use some traffic. It was fairly dirty when we climbed it, though I imagine we were one of the first parties of the season. Plenty of pine needles and detritus caught in the cracks, so take a nut tool as you climb.\n\nP1: Cardhu Crack. You'll want to climb past the Cardhu anchors up to a ledge with rap rings. (5.8, 45m)\n\nP2: Climb up and right, then traverse left along an easy hand crack on a ramp. Tree anchor. (5.6, 15m)\n\nP3: Climb right up a diagonal finger crack. The FAist describes this as a hand crack, but you'd need pretty small hands for that to be accurate. Balancy and tough - will get easier when it cleans up with more traffic, but will get harder again when the stumps eventually fall out. When clean, this will be a very nice line. Bolt anchor, belay in a hole. (5.10-, 25m)\n\nP4: The crux pitch is a beautiful and sustained line with tough, engaging climbing. Traverse right, clip a bolt, chimney up through easier ground on larger gear. Clip two more bolts as you begin tackling the main feature: a thin seam in a little mini-dihedral (like two inches of left-facing corner) . Looks improbable for the grade as the seam is almost slammed shut, but eventually the crack does open up slightly to take some small gear (yellow C3s to purple C3s). After your first piece of gear, tips locks and eventually a finger lock or two begin to reveal themselves as the angle eases up. The crack peters out at the top, so slab climb past 2 more bolts at a mid-10 grade.\nThis pitch is very balancy and technical in nature. I'd read that you could easily aid through the thin section, but I don't know - you probably could aid through it with enough RPs, but this isn't a french-free-through-a-few-moves sort of pitch. Bolt anchor. (5.11-, 40m)\n\nP5: Climb a short, steep and juggy right-leaning crack to a tree above the belay. Slab and a cool dyke traverse up to the bolt-anchors. 2 bolts, and few cracks for gear every now and then. (5.9 - 35m)\n\nP6: Walk into the forest, then climb a fun, long and easy pitch. Starts off sporty, with many jugs and foot holds and lots of different gear options. As you climb higher, the pitch becomes lower angle and slabbier in nature. Near a bolt there is a 5.8 slab move. I think there was 2 bolts on this pitch, but there may have been 3. Bolt anchor. (5.8 - 40m).\n\nTo descend, traverse left, then right up a ramp. From there a faint trail leads south to the Skywalker walk-off.\n\nStart up Cardhu Crack, the rightmost crack in the Klahanie Crack neighbourhood.\nDouble rack from red C3 to #2 Camalots, single #3 Camalot, green C3 and purple C3.
