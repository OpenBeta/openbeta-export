The climbing here is very good and the approaches are not long.  Despite those advantages it doesn't seem to see that much climbing traffic.  Perhaps the tourist popularity of the area is seen as a detraction.  Rest assured that once you cross the creek and start climbing, you won't see them, except from way above, and you won't hear them thanks to the falls.  This area is well worth a visit. \n  \n The left side of this area is home to some low-angle single and multipitch climbs of high quality.  The most well-known of which are Klahanie Crack (5.7, 1 pitch), Local Boys Do Good (5.11a, 3 pitches) and Magic Carpet Ride (5.11+, 3 pitches).  Further right from the falls, it is also home to some outstanding vertical climbs such as Man of Leisure (5.10b) and two testpiece cracks: Hungry Wolf (5.11b) and Hunter Moon (5.11d).  Note that Hungry Wolf and Hunter Moon are reversed in Kevin McLane's 2005 edition of his guidebook (on the topo the 321 and 322 are reversed)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641417e8f0cf0083295fc736","prevHistoryId":"641417d9f0cf0083295fc63f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T02:56:49.508Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:20.325Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
