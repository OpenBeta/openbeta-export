Steep, varied climbing and a nice departure from the usual Squamish corner. All bolted anchors.\n\nP1 - Easy face climbing leads to a short, steep tight hands/finger crack. 5.10-. Small ledge for the belay.\n\nP2 - Fun chimney/slot with good gear. Felt about 5.9 tops to me. Huge belay ledge.\n\nP3 - The money pitch. Climb the steep finger/hand crack until the little roof. While it looks like it should go up the corner, the climb tackles the short tight hand crack that angles right up the headwall. As that crack ends, step left onto a small ledge. Continue stepping left into the corner. The move stepping into the corner is a bit committing with your gear down and right of you (be sure to use slings). Find gear near the rock scar and make a face move out of the corner and slab up past a bolt to the top. The topo shows the crux as the face move exiting the corner, but I thought the crux was the angling hand crack.
