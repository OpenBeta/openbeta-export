The top gives you some great views of the Chief. Definitely worth checking out if you will be in Squamish for a while. \n  \n There's quite a lot of retro-scrubbing and new route activity going on (2011/2012). Hanging Gardens, for example, is now a clean 10+ that is reportedly very good with a hard (but protected) slab crux. \n  \n Many new routes have been added since the 2012 guide.
