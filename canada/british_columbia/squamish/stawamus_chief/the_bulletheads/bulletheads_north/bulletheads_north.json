Good burly fun with mega exposure! Probably doesn't get climbed a lot because of rule one.\n\nApproach pitch (5.10a): From the start of Caucasian eyes, traverse awkwardly right 10m.

You end up getting good hand jams and finger locks galore all through it, which makes resting very possible anywhere, however, as there are no feet, it's a shallow, flaring and steep corner is it ends up being a total grovel fest of full body scumming, palming nothing and thrashing...pretty solid 35 meters of very sustained climbing, crux in the last 10 feet=)  Once out of the flare you can head straight left on good ledge to dicey slab finish(10a/b-R I'd guess, I was puckered, could be 5.7) or straight up out of the flare(I haven't done this, heard it was 11c or so).  This pitch reminds me a lot of the crux pitch of Alaskan Highway...prepare for battle. \n  \n I've heard this route called 5.11+/5.12- from several solid 5.12 trad climbers...I'm not that good but do enjoy groveling, so the 5.11a grade felt accurate to me.  Very skills dependent I suspect.  Absolute must do...kind of a day ender though.\n\nFrom the start of the Tantalus Wall keep heading up the trail, up a gulley with some fixed lines.  You'll hit the belay ledge that also has other lines on it.  Most notably a 13a/b sport route on an arete, can't recall the name, but it's classic.  Keep on past this on the ledge system, when you hit a nice platform and an intimidating looking slightly overhanging flare, you've arrived.\nAwesome gear everywhere.  I took mostly small stuff, doubles purple metolius up to #3 camalots and one #4 that I place at first chance I got, 15 feet off the ground, never needed it higher up(all new style camalots), and triples from blue metolius to .75 camalots...placed everything I had.
