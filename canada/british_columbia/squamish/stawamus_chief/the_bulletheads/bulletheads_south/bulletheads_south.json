Sometimes a single section of a climb defines a route, and sometimes a single word defines that section.  For this climb, that word is smooth.  Or traverse.  Or unprotectable.  Take your pick. \n  \n P1.  Begin from a cedar groove that leads to a suprisingly airy, bolted arete.  Climb the arete to a stance at the base of a dike.  Some gear is needed near the top of the arete.  Stiff 5.8. \n  \n P2.  Follow the dike up and left on easy terrain.     Occasionally sparse but adequate gear.  Belay at bolts on the left of the arete.  5.4 \n  \n P3.  Climb slightly up from the belay, then traverse right across the smooth wall to a belay in the corner.  Suffice to say this is heady and not short.  The crux comes early in the traverse.  5.9 \n  \n P4.  Continue up the corner to the forest.  Initially awkward, and a non-trivial exit.  5.9 \n  \n It is possible to combine P3&amp;P4 with a 60m rope.  A brave soul will climb well into the corner after the traverse before placing a piece for the sake of her second; a coward (me) will throw gear in at the first opportunity.\n\nTo descend, walk-off, passing Xenolith Dance en route to Bullethead Ledge.
