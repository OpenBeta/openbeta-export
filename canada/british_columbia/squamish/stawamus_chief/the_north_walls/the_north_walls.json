The opening is A0, french-freeing a fixed line to the first of several bolts, then 5.10 climbing up on good but dirty holds (I cleaned these, but rain might restore their dirty condition), to an anchor. The climbing is sufficient to assure that you will not arrive to the anchor at 'the base' in fresh condition, and the climbing right off this anchor starts off tough and gets tougher. \n From the anchor get up a leaning, overhanging flake, (1.5\" gear) get into the corner (2\" gear) and then fight your way up the corner on slick thin jams (2-2.5\" gear) with an occasional wide piece. The crux comes about 1/3 the way up the main pitch, but the rest is still exhausting. \n At the top the climbing relaxes back to 5.10 after a few good jams (3\") and is a thinner crack (fingerlocks) to reach a serviceable bolt-and-chain anchor. \n\nApproach as for the Sheriff's Badge and continue North to the North Walls. Heading up into the Gully as for Alaska Highway, you will be perhaps 40 meters from intercepting the wall on the left when you come over a HUGE flat-topped boulder and see a large rock-pile (Cairn) on your left.

You can get there by climbing Alaska Highway to Astro Ledge then traversing left 30' or by taking Astro Ledge instead of climbing AK Hwy. If you only climbed P1 - 3, this would be an absolute 5 star classic. The pitches above are dirty and chossy and detract. \n  \n P1 (11d): Starting from Astro Ledge at a two bolt anchor go up the obvious corner with a hard move off the ledge. Mostly bolted and past fixed pins/wires, plus a small piece or two to a two bolt anchor (hanging belay). \n  \n P2 (11d/12a): New books upgraded this pitch to 12a. This is the classic splitter corner on the cover of Alpinist 35. Fingers to off fingers to .75 camalot to #1 to #2s to a bolted anchor (hanging belay). If you really want the mega pitch, link P1 &amp; 2 for full value. You could place 3x #1s on this pitch but not necessary. Alternately, the book shows that you can link this pitch into the next one in 50m. You could use 3x #1s if linking this way. You probably cannot link P1,2 &amp;3 into the super-mega-pitch. \n  \n P3 (5.10+): If you belayed on bolts at the end of the last pitch, get back into the splitter for 30' then up into the chimney roof. If you only brought 1x #3 then bump it as you pull the roof and leave it above. You could bring a second #3 if you wanted. Don't wear a pack in the chimney. Climb to the top of the splitter and traverse on undercling fingers to a bolted belay (hanging belay). \n  \n Side note: a partial linkup variation of Alaska Highway to The Calling but ending here at the end of P3 on the Calling and rapping out is called \"Southern Lights\". This is my recommendation. This way is an absolute 5 star classic. The following pitches aren't that good and get REALLY dirty. Seemed like you could rap off with a single 70 but I'm not positive. Might want to bring two ropes if rapping. Linking AK Hwy and all of the Calling is called \"Northern Lights\". \n  \n P4 (5.12a): Sport pitch (maybe a gear placement). Right around the corner and into the dihedral (tricky start). Continue up this rather dirty corner past bolts then left up onto the face and a stance. Pull the crux (maybe 12a for a tall person but way harder for a short person, or A0). Pass a few more bolts to a bolted anchor on a super dirty slab with 6\" think moss everywhere and be perplexed as to where you should go to navigate the dirtiness on the next pitch. \n  \n P5 (5.10 moss &amp; choss): From the belay there are two bolts. One is out right towards a cool looking crack but the slab seemed plenty harder than 5.10 and runout (and was really dirty and mossy friction climbing). I don't think the route goes this way as the book says \"rock continues to deteriorate in the bushy corner above\". Look up and slightly left of the belay. There is a bolt about 25' up hiding in the moss. You will see an old pin with tat on the vert wall above it. Go up that way (there's also two bolts next to the pin), clip, go right into the bushy corner. Climb poor quality rock up then left across a loose 4th class ramp to a ledge. Belay here on gear in kitty litter or on a tree or off an old single smc bolt. \n  \n P6 (5.10+): Another pretty dirty pitch with subpar rock takes to you the top. Start up the corner, then past the pins on the face, back to the crack, pulling the #2 roof, then right through one more roof with undercling lock. Mantle the sandy ledge. Belay off a tree. \n  \n Descent: Go straight right along the cliff edge for 5 minutes (past the big cave/chimney) until you're forced up and into a switchback. Go to the Chief summit and walk down the Chief trail.  \n\nOn the North Walls starting above Alaska Highway on Astro Ledge. Just Left of Yukon Gold. Approach via Alaska Highway or scramble up via Astro Ledge. If you do top the route out, go straight right along the cliff edge for a while following a well beaten path (go around right of the massive chimney cave thing, do NOT switchback after the first 50m of walking). Make a switchback after about 5 - 10 minutes of walking. Follow the well beaten path past red tape. Take this up to the summit area then wander back down via the Chief trail.\nThe guidebook rack says 2x 1/2\" to 3.5\" with 3x 1.5\" - 2\" and 2 sets of wire, RPs to 1\". Now that the first pitch is mostly bolted, you can get away with less. I think a standard double rack from green alien to #2 camalot plus a #3 camalot would be fine. You could take a third .5, #1 or #2 camlot, especially if linking the enduro corner. Also take 12 draws / shoulder slings.

A few grunty moves past a wide section get you to some hand jams, then an alcove where you can chill out. Move up right from this along a cool, detached flake, which brings you to a horizontal, leftward finger traverse (save that black totem for this).

We did not do the lower section  below Astro ledge, so I can't speak of that, but it sounds like nobody ever did that portion.  Expect some dirty mossy lichen covered cracks, route finding and be prepared for an adventure. Less woods hiking than angels crest.  In the old McLane book it is 5.9 and 10a in the more recent one. \n  \n This route would be awesome with a clean-up. \n  \n A great place to be on a hot day, even the descent is mostly in the dark woods, unlike the top of the middle or south peaks.  It's a great up and over adventure in the shade. \n  \n General directions, but not too specific to keep it an adventure. \n  \n We approached via the first 4 pitches of parallel passages, and followed fixed ropes lines to the base \n  \n We had no description of the route, and followed the path of least resistance. \n  \n 1) Off astro ledge, find the tree with the green flagging and a blocky gully near the sharp bend of the trail. Combine first 2 pitches, pass first belay, low 5th class, unless you like the look of the hand crack on the left side as I did, around the crest to the right, another chain on tree. 60 meters   \n 2) move the belay or simulclimb 20- 30 meters left of crest, lead out  40- 50 meters up blocky flakes  to conifer in groove. 5.7/5.8 \n 3) combine 2 pitches here for a nice long varied cracks 60 meter pitch. 5.9 . plenty of ledges if you want to break it up. toward the end of this there is a chimney with a flake on the right and an old knarly Yew tree to crawl under and mantle at the end on a dirty top out to big tree ledge with a view out west. \n 4) through a cleft in the rock behind 3 pine trees, avoids dropping into dirty gully on the left. Large chockstone gully.  Follow the right side crack to avoid the chockstones. laybacks to crawl under trees on ledge. 20 meters    5.9 \n 5) move belay 30 meters left through woods with a blocky start, then easy path to 2nd chimney.Either belay at top of 5.6 chimney or continue up dirty corner, avoid brush by climbing small slot/chimney on the right, traverse blocky arete to left side and up to slopping ledge, cross log, steep layback till belay at Cedar and birch, 60 meters, 5.9 \n 6) This is the most obvious path on the whole route because there is a piton in the corner ahead of you. finger crack runs into chimney/cave, the birthing pitch brings you out to the sunshine for the first time all day at the top of Zodiac. 10a past the piton, or pull on it with the cracks being 5.8 then. \n  \n Interesting hike up to Zodiac peak, passing the slack line to the third peak.  find another rope to pull up and fixed ropes to the top.  Good views that you don't see from the other peaks.  Find trail down rugged third peak trail.  Take a side trip up the slahany trail to view cobra crack on the way down or visit the solarium wall.\n\nWe approached via Parallel Passages first 4 pitches, which can be done at 10a if you do the left hand 5.9 on the first pitch. Parallel Passages is pretty scruffy and loose, so adds to the alpine like feel of this day without hiking up the north gully to Astro ledge, which is the other option. <br /> It is situated in the middle of the north end of the Zodiac formation.\nStandard rack to 4\" Camalot.
