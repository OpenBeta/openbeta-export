There are lots of ledges and terraces, and moving the belay is quite common. \n  \n Begin on a blocky pitch of 5.8 with a pin.  Climb up to a large ledge and belay. \n  \n Climb the magnificent Angel's Crack, a diagonal hand and finger crack, at 5.10a.  Belay on a good ledge at its end. \n  \n Next, climb a difficult face, the crux, at 10b past 2 bolts and up into a corner.  There is a belay at a large slung boulder on a slab, but I thought it was more comfortable to climb another 15 feet up and belay on the ledge above. \n  \n Traverse along the ledge and up some easy slab to the base of the next wall (5.7). \n  \n Face climb up to the beginning of a left-facing corner.  Step right below this corner and enter a right-facing corner on the other side.  This can be tricky to see from below.  Climb up the corner (5.10a) and step right again below a roof.  Belay on a ledge. \n  \n Climb a pitch of 5.7 to a large ledge.  This pitch can be successfully linked with the last one to make one long pitch. \n  \n Move the belay to the base of the next wall.  Climb up a ramp, step right to a second ramp, then step right again into a corner system (5.10a). \n  \n Move the belay again.  There are two options here.  The normal way is to climb up a 5.9 lieback in a corner to another large ledge.  The second is a 5.10b 7\" offwidth crack.  This crack is pretty consistent in size, so you can't get a #5 Camalot in there, even way back (trust me on this one).  Bring your Big Bros if you wanna shot at this beast. \n  \n Follow the climber's trail up through the trees to the base of the Acrophobe's Traverse.  Climb to the top of the first tower (5.7), rap off the back side, then scramble up low 5th class rock to a fixed rope (you can see it from the top of the rappel).  Descend the fixed rope to a dirty alcove and climb up to the notch between the highest tower and the ridge (low 5th). \n  \n From the notch, climb up to a nice ledge (5.9). \n  \n You have a couple options from here.  Start at a tree (using the tree to get past the start is permissable) and climb a 5.8+ fist crack up to a blocky corner.  Continue up to the Whaleback Arete and belay at the base of the next, steep and somewhat intimidating, wall.  Otherwise, traverse right along the ledge and climb a 5.10b/c crack, joining the route at the top of the Whaleback Arete. \n  \n Begin this pitch at the large dead tree growing out of the crack.  Pull through this opening roof past a pin using the main crack and also a second crack on the left.  Continue jamming up steep ground, past several small roofs and a couple trees to the top of the wall (5.10a).  This pitch is sustained and somewhat strenuous, so make sure you have some energy left! \n  \n Step right into a 5.8 squeeze chimney, which opens up near the top.  If you are carrying a pack, bring a double-length sling to drop the pack on, you won't be able to fit in the chimney otherwise. \n  \n Congratulations!  You are at the top!  Enjoy the views from the Chief on the walk back, and then high-tail it down to the Howe Sound Brew Pub to celebrate!\n\nFrom the Angel's Crest/North Gully Trail, find a dirty 5.7 corner, just past the large roof.  The route starts at the top of this corner on a large ledge.  This is a fairly popular route, so the best way to find it is to look for signs of wear.\nA normal rack up to about 3\".  Doubles in the 1-1.5\" range could be nice.

You get a little bit of everything on this baby, including a burly  but bolt protected - squeeze chimney.  Highly recommended. \n  \n The bad news?  You might have Madonna's song running through your head like I did...... I was even whistling it without knowing it while climbing.  Fortunately nobody was around..... \n  \n I read an interesting post on cascadeclimbers.com from the first ascent folks.  They debated the bolts on the chimney, since  in theory  it could be protected with big bros, but ultimately decided that if big bros were required, the climb wouldnt get done, and then would get grown over and forgotten to obscurity.  Because of the bolts, the route gets repeated  which keeps it clean.   The bolts were placed on lead from, apparently, sketchy big bros. \n  \n A great route that I imagine required a mighty cleaning effort to establish. \n  \n  P1 (10b)  Start on the far left side of the bushy ledge at the end of the approach/scramble trail.  There are anchor bolts to belay here.  The first bolt requires a move or two to reach, but there is bomber pro at your feet.  Make some technical face moves and trend up left through cracks until you reach the obvious corner.  Continue up the corner and pull around a big tree.   Your belay bolts are here, but around the corner to the left  not visible unless you look for them.  45m. P2 (5.8) I chose the 5.8 version, but there is also an 11c version.  Head up the corner until it is possible to traverse right about 10 and gain another crack.  Up this crack, pull on the tree, and then climb through the dirt a bit.  If you continue up, youll be on the Terrace below Blazing Saddles.  Instead, take the cracks/corner up and left past a single bolt to the anchor.  30m. P3 (10d)  Climb up the ramp and traverse left about 40 to the first bolt (some gear is available midway).   The next 4-5 bolts offer sustained mid-10 face climbing with quality, fun movement and plenty of bolts.  The bolts end at a splitter finger crack.   Charge up the finger crack for quite a ways to the anchor.  The books calls the finger crack 10d, but it felt more like 10b/c to me.  It is sustained though.  A long, varied pitch.  45m. P4 (10a) Easy climbing up the ramp ends at a fun roof.  Pull the roof and continue up about 40 to the anchor.  Above you looms the chimney. (about 25m) P5 (10a) How often do you get to arm bar and clip bolts at the same time??????  Step one, clip the bolt.  Step two, figure out how to start the chimney.  Step three, arm bar away!   Apparently you can layback the chimney, but that wouldnt be near as much fun.  Thanks to the F/A folks for placing the bolts, otherwise this climb would never get done (the squeeze chimney is about 8\" wide).  Finish the chimney and head around right up a layback crack.  We built a belay about 10 about the snag, way too much rope drag to continue. (about 30m) P6 (10d) Fun, well protected bolt clipping to the top (about 20m).\n\nStart on the far left side of the approach/scramble trail.  To find the trail, drive 0.5km on the Mamquam (sp?) forest road.   In 2008, the trail was marked by a cairn and after entering the forest a giant BC Climbers Association sign indicates Sheriff Badge Trail.  The tail to Angel Crest begins nearby, so be sure you are on the right trail.\nNuts, doubles TUCs to #2 camalot.  One #3 camalot.\nOne can continue into Angel's Crest (8-10 more pitches), but we rapped from the top.  P3 requires a bit of a traverse/pendulum, but it was doable since there is a small ledge system.  We didn't rappel the first two pitches, and instead rapped onto Terrace Ledge and then did the standard rappel from there (can be done with one 60m in two raps).  A trail through the bushes (steep at the end) from the Terrace leads to the first set of chains.  The next set of chains is about 60' down.  The next rap is a full 30m."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"a/+HxYQ8XVqC8x0+NhsHdg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1415,49.686]}},"createdBy":"AGL+8ih0VeqNpOO8TawOcQ==","_change":{"user":"AGL+8ih0VeqNpOO8TawOcQ==","historyId":"64141c01f0cf0083295ffc51","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:51:29.717Z"},{"_id":"BABztPXwQMynNHUGvxEZMA==","name":"Cowboys and Indians","grades":{"yds":"5.6"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":true,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"1999 Perry Beckham","content":{"description":"\nP1 A2 45m\n\nP2 A3 Hooks and rusty rivets, with the occasional beak and head.
