Significantly easier than pitches 1 and 3.\n\nPitch 5: The Free of Tranquility 13a, 40m (single rack to #2) From the Tree of Tranquility climb the endless enduro tips corner past multiple cruxes and a no-feet rest. An awesome pitch.\n\nPitch 6: The Ocean of Crisis 12d, 40m (small nuts and cams to #.75) Clip a bolt then rage up the corner placing small gear until it is possible to wildly traverse left to the exposed arête. From here one last heartbreaker crux guards the easier blocky scramble to the chains.\n\nPitch 7: Sports Illustrated 11d, 30m (sport) Excellent technical face climbing through the blobs.\n Pitch 8: 10d, 30m (single rack) Continue up the arête then traverse left into Clean Corner, be wary of some loose chockstones in the chimney. Or, go straight up the incredible unclimbed 5.14(?) fridge-hugging prow, bring some bolts for this variation.\n\nDescent: Rappel from anywhere on the route with an 80m rope and some shenanigans, or walk off.\n\nHistory: In 1990 Perry Beckham and Bill Noble rappelled in and established Sports Illustrated, as a wild hanging single pitch. The corner was first aid-climbed by Matt Maddaloni around 2000. Then around 2015 Luke Neufeld and friends put considerable effort toward cleaning, bolting and climbing the first 5 pitches. Jacob Cook and I prepped the rest of the pitches and climbed the route continuously in August 2020.\n\n \n\n\n\nApproach from the lower Chief lot via the Freeway trail.\n\nSingle set to #2, microcams, small wires and ten draws."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"G8iY9vvVW8CLj0jxDynyWg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1482,49.6814]}},"createdBy":"ywDRMBqZVLOL3sze6X7uQw==","_change":{"user":"ywDRMBqZVLOL3sze6X7uQw==","historyId":"64141aa6f0cf0083295feafa","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:45:42.800Z"},{"_id":"3nJC5AvcSDaIdbve/6ifeA==","name":"Sticky Fingers","grades":{"yds":"5.9"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Ivan Christiansen, Rolf Rybak","length":35,"content":{"description":"This route follows small right facing corner and a right leaning crack.

With the exception of Crap Crags, this is the easiest free route to breach the West Face of the Chief. That said, it is very sustained at 5.10, harder than Angels Crest but easier than the Grand.\n\nSunset Strip utilizes sections of other climbs, Sticky Fingers, Millennium Falcon, Crap Crags, and The Gauntlet, with about 70% new terrain to create a very direct and interesting line up the Chief.\n\nThe route has 12 pitches, several pitches can be linked and it is likely that many teams will repeat the route in 9 or 10 pitches. That said, the shorter pitches take advantage of good belay stances, decrease rope drag, and will reduce the size of rack required. The route is very well protected with several bolts added to the previously bold upper sections of The Gauntlet. Being located in the Western Dihedrals the route will be subject to annual peregrine falcon closures, although in 2013 there is no such closure in effect.\n\n1. 5.10c. Sticky Fingers. Step off fortuitously lodged boulder onto a desperate slab move past a new bolt. Follow right leaning thin finger cracks until possible to escape left onto large ledge system. 35m.\n\n2. 5.10a. Layback the edge of a wide corner past two bolts. Continue up fun chimney (end of p.1 of Millennium Falcon) to a belay atop a small tower. 18m.\n\n3. 5.10b. Two variations at the start provide the crux, the right hand being slightly easier. Beautiful and continuous finger cracks linking several left facing corners pull out to the right to a stance on the open slabs, (this is p. 2 of Millennium Falcon). 40m.\n\n4. 5.10c. Climb the finger crack straight up into an off fingers flare, cruxy moves around a bulge to small stance at the base of box corner feature. 18m.\n\n5. 5.9. Climb up the box corner, passing blocky roofs on the left. 20m.\n\n6. 5.10b. Step right into short flare feature, exit the flare by laybacking leaning corner, easier climbing leads to a large belay ledge. 20m.\n\n7. 5.10a. Climb past bolt to left facing corners, an aesthetic undercling leads to small belay stance. 20m. The 5.8 chimney pitch of Millennium Falcon is just to the right.\n\n8. 5.8. Left facing corners give way to broken, low 5th class ramps, follow right trending ramp to its end. (The upper part of this pitch is Crap Crags). 30m.\n\n9. 5.10d. Face climb past 5 bolts to an exciting left facing corner. Continue up easier grooves taking care not to miss the belay stance out right on the arete. (This is pitch 8 of the Gauntlet). 25m.\n\n10. 5.10a. Traverse right from the belay to access excellent hand/fist crack on the basalt infused headwall. The belay anchor is hidden from view on a small ledge to the left. 25m.\n\n11. 5.10d. Traverse right in a wild position, face climbing and gravelly underclings lead to a short, steep crux. Fully bolt protected. 15m.\n\n12. 5.9. Steep and exposed chimneying, finishing with a short squeezer. Entirely fixed with 4 bolts and one piton. (this is the last half p.10 of The Gauntlet). 15m.\n\n\nBelays are all fixed and rappel anchors are installed to the top of pitch 7. The route can be rappelled from pitch 7 down with one 60m rope. From the top of pitch 3 the single rope rappel line is down to the right towards the Gauntlet and will require a bit of route finding and care to make it work. There is currently fixed lines on the Gauntlet, please do not use these ropes or change the rigging in any way. <br />  <br /> Rack: A single set of cams to #4 BD and nuts, 2 X .3, .4, .5, and .75 BD, should be enough for most people.

The fourth pitch (\"Crackis Smackis\") is one of the best finger cracks in town! A photo of Jesse Huey leading this pitch is on the cover of the 2012 edition of the Squamish Select guidebook. \n  \n With the exception of P7, all pitches end with beefy bolted anchors and rap rings. \n  \n The route begins in the left-facing corner system just left of Freeway. \n  \n P1: Start up the huge arching ramp, which eventually steepens and turns into a vertical left facing corner.  This ramp can be dirty and it collects pine needles after a rain. Gear is also sparse, but not too bad. There are three bolts you can clip, but I personally find the path of least resistance skips the first one. Ive also seen it climbed skipping all the bolts and climbing the features further to the right. 5.10 (30m) \n  \n P2: Continue up the corner and make some committing moves well above a bolt to a stem corner/groove. The moves after this bolt before you can get solid gear are exciting, but safe. The gear before the crux stem corner/groove is good. Make some true stem moves to some great holds on the left. Take a breather and continue up the short left-facing corner to the anchor. 5.11- (30m) \n  \n P3:  Follow the bolts up into the cracks, which is when the climbing eases into hero climbing. Follow the cracks to the anchor. 5.11- (35m) \n  \n P4: (Crackis Smakis) This is what you came for! Climb up and right past two bolts and enter the thin-finger crack. The hardest moves are earlier, so hang in there because it gets easier as you get higher. Look for features to use outside the crack to aid you in linking the reachy finger locks. The gear is solid, but can be finicky and strenuous to place.  After ~ 10m you get a pretty good rest; place a couple pieces of gear (small) and make the final cruxy moves to better holds above. Follow the splitter and hero finger crack for ~ 15m to the anchor, which has a few rests along the way. 5.12- (30m) \n  \n P5:  The crux pitch. This pitch is entirely bolted (~ 10 bolts I think?).  Follow the bolts up and left and then back right again. The moves between the first and second bolt are 5.11+ and a fall here could result in a fall right onto your belayer; be careful and attentive! (Edit: You can apparently get in a solid green alien between the first and second bolts to mitigate this risk) After the second bolt, there are bolts more-or-less in your face for the cruxy moves. The crux of this pitch are the final moves pulling over the little roof. \n  \n P6: Climb up past three bolts before entering the left-facing and left-leaning corner. His corner eats up gear and generally the gear widens from small to large as you progress. There are no cruxy moves in the corner, but rather it is a pitch of endurance. Although there are several restful positions en route. The final moves involve you making some committing and exciting moves out of the corner to the right. Be careful not to the follow the corner too far. Most parties rappel the route from here, but the next two pitches are well worth the effort. \n  \n P7: Climb straight up, passing one bolt. Once you reach the small ledge, traverse left and clip two more bolts as you make your way to the right-facing corner. The final moves before the corner require to down climb a bit on slabby feet and poor holds for your hands. Once in the corner, climb straight up and belay at the tree. This anchor is gear and as of June 2015 there is one bolt you can also use. This bolt has no hanger though, but it does have a washer and nut. \n  \n P8: Climb straight up the left-trending groove with a hand crack in the back. Towards the end of this groove are two ancient bolts (perhaps an old anchor?). Just past these bolts is a short splitter fist crack. Climb this to its end and get an OK rest before making some strenuous traversing moves left with poor feet. The traverse is ~ three metres and ends at a splitter hand crack. Take this splitter hand crack for a few more metres to the anchors.\n\nDoubles to 3\"."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"G8iY9vvVW8CLj0jxDynyWg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1482,49.6814]}},"createdBy":"Uo5NWA4eXs2zjbfExgS+7w==","_change":{"user":"Uo5NWA4eXs2zjbfExgS+7w==","historyId":"64141aa8f0cf0083295feb22","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:45:44.620Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,a354b580-870b-5444-9f11-2c0e78995841,8f267065-fc1a-59ce-bcf1-6e9335548363,1bc898f6-fbd5-5bc0-8b8f-48f10f29f25a","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Squamish","Stawamus Chief","The Dihedrals"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":3,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":16,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":12,"expert":1}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":12,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1482,49.6814]},"bbox":[-123.14889495245488,49.680950339818125,-123.14750504754514,49.68184966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"G8iY9vvVW8CLj0jxDynyWg=="},"content":{"description":"This section of huge corners is located on the chief between the grand wall and tantalus wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141aa8f0cf0083295feb22","prevHistoryId":"64141aa8f0cf0083295feb18","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":18,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:45:32.481Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:11.673Z","updatedBy":"avcBILURV6mIM3sOvj81XQ=="}
