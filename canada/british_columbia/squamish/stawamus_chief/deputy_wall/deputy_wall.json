The route features mostly gear climbing, with a few bolts on some pitches, two bolt ladders (or free at 12+) and entirely bolted belays (except one which is a tree).  Pro is plentiful and bomber.\n\nThe route has excellent pro, a wide variety of climbing (from finger-to-hand cracks, a short wide crack, a slab traverse, etc), some wild positions and a cool finish.\n\nIt is possible to rappel the route from P12 down.  From the top of P2, one can rap 30m to a station, and from there 25m to the ground.\n\nP1:  Climb a v-slot or arete to right of V slot.  Then either straight up (10d bolts and gear) or up and slightly right (11b gear) to a bolt and right to belay.\n\nP2:  Up and right to a flake-crack, up and right, then down and right past bolts.  5.9\n\nP3: MONEY!  Awesome 30m of fingers to hands.  5.11b bomber gear\n\nP4:  MONEY!  Hands to fists. 5.10c bomber gear.\n\nP5:  Up the dihedral (5.12d or 5.9 A0) past bolts.\n\nP6: Traverse 30 right past bolts on the wildly exposed Green Line ledge 5.5\n\nP7:  MONEY!  Up and left through the leaning corner.  Often wet 5.12\n\nP6 and P7 bypass: traverse halfway along the Green Line Ledge (5.5) then up the bolt ladder to the top of P7\n\nP8:  Do an awkward set of moves past a few bolts, a tree and some gear placements, mantle, then up and left past bolts (5.10d).  OR head left after tree and follow a finger crack and other moves up to station (5.11a)\n\nP9:  Up the nice corner 5.9\n\nP10:  Scramble up and right past bolts and brush 5.5\n\nP11:  MONEY!  Up the widening corner past a few bolts.  An 11+ variation heads right about 10m up  5.10d\n\nP12:  Go to blocks on right side of ledge, then up past bolts and gear. 5.10a\n\nP13:  Straight up to under roof, then left past bolts to a short crack.  Belay on tree.  5.10b\n\nWalk left about 30 m on forested ledge.\n\nP14:  Follow a blocky right-trending crack to harder moves off bolts past a short roof.  5.10d\n\nP15:  MONEY!  Up the yellwo flake, then undercling in a cool position into the base of the massive V-slot 5.8\n\nP16:  MONEY MONEY!  Up the 5.3 offwidth for 10m past one bolt, then stem and jam the awesome steepening V-slot hand and fist crack to a ledge.  Move up and slightly left past ledge to station. 5.10c or feels harder if you didn't bring enough water\n\nP17:  Step to right side of ledge, and wander up for two pitches on either slabs with occasional bolts, trees and gear, OR head up and slightly left through a gnarly ugly 4th class bypass to top of 2nd summit.  The route tops out on fairly close to Ultimate Everything.","location":"The route begins at a clean obvious v-groove which (as of summer 2010) has a fixed blue line hanging off it.
