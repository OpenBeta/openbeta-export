An excellent route in its own right, it also provides a great, all-free way to access the Grand Wall.  Expect amazing, consistent pitches of technical face climbing at the 5.10 level, good mixed pro, and immaculate rock.  Enough can't be said about this awesome climb. \n  \n P1: Begin at the base of the Chief in the corner just right of Apron Strings.  Ascend the corner (The Flake) via stemming and chimneying to a belay high up in the corner at a stance.  5.10b.  Alternatively, climb the first pitch of Apron Strings (10b), a higher quality pitch up the face to the left of the corner to the same belay. \n  \n P2: Continue up the corner briefly before traversing right out onto the face and up a steep, bolted crux section. There is a long runout on this pitch on easy climbing. Continue on to a belay.  5.10d R. \n  \n P3: Traverse almost straight right for half a ropelength to the base of a right-facing, right-leaning corner system.  The final moves around and into this corner are difficult for the grade (the key to keeping it 10b is to step down at the final bolt without being greedy and trying to clip it - once at the anchor reach back and clip it to protect your second), but the pitch is reasonably well-protected for both the leader and second.  5.10b.   \n  \n P4: Ascend the sustained leaning corner to a point where one can exit out right and up to a belay at a stance. Sensibly linked into the next pitch.  5.10c. \n  \n P5: A committing move leads to a good ledge with a pin and bolt. From here continue up past a second bolt at 5.10+ (tough) and then left or from the first bolt head hard left and then up at 5.9.  Both are somewhat run out in places.  An excellent pitch. R. \n  \n P6: The final pitch climbs up and right via a very thin crescent-like corner.  Eventually the route trends almost straight back left to the ledge at the base of the Split Pillar.  This pitch is entirely bolted and well-protected.  5.10d (easier if you're tall). \n  \n Rap with two ropes or continue on. \n  \n Along with Fiddler on the Roof in Red Rocks, Nevada, Birds of Fire in Rocky Mountain National Park, and Stoner's Highway in Yosemite, Cruel Shoes rounds out a quartet of absolutely classic North American multipitch face climbs all checking in at around 5.10+.\n\nLight rack through a #1 Camalot (Apron Strings requires extra finger-sized gear)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"LxUlWjjbVtWdddi4tfvh2A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14798,49.68218]}},"createdBy":"rx5t0D3KUASC6toru3TsUw==","_change":{"user":"rx5t0D3KUASC6toru3TsUw==","historyId":"64141ab0f0cf0083295feb58","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:45:52.662Z"},{"_id":"VBGU7V0eTdqx/P85dq8tPQ==","name":"The Free Grand","grades":{"yds":"5.13a"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"FCFA: Scott Cosgrove","content":{"description":"The Grand Wall can go completely free via a number of harder variations to the original line. \n  The Free Grand combines fun enduro laybacking with delicate face climbing in a spectacular position on the wall.Climb Apron Strings, Merci-Me, and the traverse to the base of the pillar but belay at the first station below the short bolt ladder. \n  \n Var 1: 5.12a/b.

It has is all: perfect rock, great setting, runout slab, stellar crack, strenuous laybacking, delicate face, and many variations. \n  \n The first ascent was a 40 day epic, beautifully documented in the film \"In the Shadow of the Chief\" available from  fringefilmworks.com/ \n  \n It was finally freed at 5.13b in 2000 by Scott Cosgrove and Annie Overlin using a number of variations. \n  \n You can get to the base of the Split Pillar by one of the routes listed in the Area description. Merci Me is described here: \n  \n P1: From Flake Ledge climb the first pitch of Merci Me (5.7) past three bolts. The first is probably 30 or more feet out. \n  \n P2: Merci Me continues up and slightly left into trickier terrain (5.8).  Break right near the second bolt and go past a detached flake and then to a two bolt belay right where the wall becomes vertical. \n  \n P3: Traverse right and slightly down, around the bulge (out of sight from your belayer) and into the 10b rising traverse.  This traverse has good pro, but the feet are poor making it strenuous.  Aid or boulder (5.12-) past three bolts to the base of the Split Pillar. \n  \n P4: The Split Pillar is a highly photogenic crack comparable to an Indian Creek splitter.  It's 10b to jam, but you would need the endurance of a 5.12 climber to layback it.  The crack widens relentlessly from rattly fingers to wide fists over about 100ft.  30 more feet include some fun flake and squeeze chimney moves.  The belay on top of the pillar is second to none. \n  \n P5-6: The Sword is the technical crux of the route with an 11a crux early on.  Place a few good pieces before committing to it.  Pull out left onto the face above the crux and savour the exposure that might seem to have crept up on you.  Easier climbing through a broken crack eventually forces you back into the dihedral on the right for a technical endurance finish to keep you honest.  The belay here is in a spectacular position, but it's hanging and can be avoided by linking the bolt ladder above.  Slings can serve as etriers for the 8 or 9 bolts in the ladder. \n  \n P7: Perry's Layback is a fully bolted, lower angle pitch, which makes it sound like a walk, but many people debate whether it's the crux of route rather than The Sword.  Climb efficiently... \n  \n P8: The Flats: Several variations are possible here.  The easiest, at 10a, goes right along a ledge until bolts lead up a slab to a ledge.  A very reachy pull takes you to the belay ledge. \n  \n P9: The final pitch is a very honest 10c requiring some tree climbing and then underclinging horizontally to the right around a big flake (The Sail Flake).  Once the flake heads up and back left you're pretty much there. \n  \n The climb can continue via the Roman Chimneys route, but most traverse off via Bellygood Ledge, a well-named 300 foot traverse to the right.  Stay roped up. \n  \n Descent: After traversing Bellygood, continue heading right into the forest.  The trail should take you to a slab that you can descend hugging the vertical wall.  A knotted rope will eventually take you to the well traveled backside trail which will take you to the climbers campground and finally the parking lot. \n\nThe route \"really\" starts with the Split Pillar (approaches described in the Grand Wall Area description), but since Merci Me is the minimum mandatory climbing to get to the start, this description assumes you've scrambled up to Flake Ledge (the shortest variation).\nMerci Me is runout bolts (up to 5.8) with some small to medium cams and nuts possible near the end. <br />  <br /> The 10b traverse to the Split Pillar takes singles of small (finger size) to medium cams and nuts. <br />  <br /> The bolt ladders are manageable with improvised etriers and spare 'biners or draws. <br />  <br /> The Split Pillar is the gear hog on the route.  A double set of cams from off-fingers to wide fists is normal.  More if you're going to dog (and you will if you layback), less if you're solid jamming from tight hands to big fists.  Save a 1.5 inch piece for the last 15 feet.  The final squeeze chimney isn't easily protectable, but hey, it's a squeeze chimney. <br />  <br /> The Sword pitch takes mostly smaller nuts and cams up to tight hands.  There are a few opportunities for slung horns and a 2 inch cam is optional. <br />  <br /> Perry Layback is closely bolted. <br />  <br /> The 10a pitch in The Flats is bolted but a small nut and a hand-size cam are handy. <br />  <br /> The final pitch takes finger to hand size cams. <br />  <br /> A few quick draws and cams are handy on the traverse off Bellygood Ledge."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"LxUlWjjbVtWdddi4tfvh2A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14798,49.68218]}},"createdBy":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg==","_change":{"user":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg==","historyId":"64141ab2f0cf0083295feb76","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:45:54.573Z"},{"_id":"xSrBKpiqRUCbS2aP/zyu+Q==","name":"The Grinning Weasel","grades":{"yds":"5.11b"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Peter Croft, Greg Foweraker 1982","length":24,"content":{"description":"\nSplitter arching corner crack that starts at the top of the Left Side of split pillar.Â \n\n\n\nRoute starts at the top of Left Side of Split Pillar\n\nPrimarily 3\" crack, getting thin near the top.

Follow the series of nubins, edges, and pockets out and left then straight up to the anchor. \n p5 10a Â some additional nubbins lead to padding to the top. A nice finish for this two pitch section. \n  \n Walk up the obvious trail and then head off to the left towards the main face of the grand wall. The trail ends at that fixed line across an exposed 15ft ledge getting you to a bolted anchor. \n  \n Land of freedom 10a \n p6 10a Â start in a dirty corner with roots and a tree stump. Clip two bolts then take a delicate step out and left to get to another diagonal dyke that heads up and to the left. Continue on to the anchors and enjoy the view. \n  \n Continue up the obvious trail up and left until you find a fixed rope that takes you up a 6 foot cliff band. Climb the old ratty rope and continue left for another 20 feet to the obvious flake. \n  \n Moonwatcher 9 \n p7 9 Â Climb up the crack using nice jams and good feet (optional #2 camalot). Clip the bolt and move out onto the face up to the tree anchor at the top. \n  \n Continue hiking up and left towards a nice trail at the top of Tantulus wall. While quite exposed, flip-flops worked just fine for the hike. Find the correct trail to get you out onto Bellygood. There is a set of anchors in the corner. \n  \n Belly good ledge 5.root-pull \n p7a Â not really much of a pitch, but the first 5-10 feet are a little airy and dirty. After that, walk the ledge out past a bolt until you reach the anchors at the base of millennium falcon (near a tree, ~120 feet). \n  \n The next three pitches provide the hardest climbing on the route, with good distances between bolts. \n  \n Millennium falcon 10c \n p8 10a Â a nice pitch, although there is some distance between the bolts. Head up and right following generally good holds. The pitch is fairly sustained, but there are good rests in-between the individual cruxes. \n p9 10c Â the crux pitch of the route. Head out right then back left on some delicate edges to a large crack. Follow the crack for another ~30 feet of fairly easy climbing (#2 camalot optional). Make the step up on the large block before you can clip the bolt, then head out and right to some difficult moves over a jagged roof. \n  \n The universal key 10b \n p10 Â a hard and sustained pitch, some distance between bolts. Start up the dihedral with positive but reachy holds till the roof above your head forces you out and to the right. A difficult padding move gets you onto a dirty ledge. Continue right until you hit the first of two cracks. Make an exciting step across (again, very reachy) then head up to a surprising finish. I thought the was the hardest pitch on the route. \n  \n Traverse of the gods 9 \n p11 Â start by walking left on a nice ledge until it pinches off and you are forced onto the slab. Pad across the slab until reaching the start of a dyke feature passing the first set of anchors you see, stopping at the second belay. Described in the guidebook at 5.9, itÂs really a 5.8 (see next pitch) \n p12 Â continue on the dyke feature passing bolts that are very hard to see until you are almost on top of them. The climbing has a very similar feel to women in confortable shoes, just a grade easier. Traverse to the black dyke, then head up and left to an anchor below a large roof near a tree. Described in the guidebook as 5.8, its really fairly sustained 5.9. \n  \n The upper black dyke 10a \n p13 Â head out onto the main black dyke feature climbing Âexit 38Â style rock, clipping bolts along the way. The crux of the pitch is no particular move, rather its finding the good holds that allow you to move up. Watch for the loose rock not only for your partner, but the several routes below on the main grand wall. \n  \n Continue up and left to Penthouse Wall. Walk past a memorial to Mr. Ciechanowski, then take a short fixed handline down to the trail. The first route you come to (about 30 feet) is the next pitch. \n  \n Mr. Ciechanowski 10a \n p14 - (right most route on the Penthouse). Easier than it looks, follow nice jugs over the roof to a nice series of edges up to the anchor. Reachy again. \n  \n Walk left to Raven's Castle (starting on the very far left side and up a gulley, start out the dyke heading across the wall) \n  \n Joe's Dyke 5.6 \n p15 Â easy padding past a few bolts. A short pitch. You can start waving at the tourists from here on. \n  \n Ladies First 10a \n p16 Â Head out and left from the anchor to a small ramp that leads to a flake.

Move into the left facing corner and deal with the usual wetness.  Even in the driest, most drought stricken summers, I have NEVER seen this pitch dry.  Pull a wet lock or two and make your way to the base of the evil overhanging slot.  Grovel your way to the chains. \n  \n p2.  12-, 70'.  Big fingers in the corner leads to an undercling out left.  Going straight up is the Shadow, maybe the best pitch in Squamish? (12d+). Get creative and grovel to the chains. \n  \n p3.  11+ 40'.  If you hit everything right I guess its only 11+, BUT on the OS, expect it to feel harder.  Fingers in a wide chimney/slot over a roof to a great ledge. \n  \n p4. 5.11-, 100'.  Great fingers in a corner, either go left on some under clings or straight up to a roof and underclings, a few fixed pins.  Both ways are 11-, and I don't think either one is better or easier, having done both. \n  \n p5.  10+ 100'.  From the comfy tree belay pull past a wide slot to some amazing steep fingers. \n  \n p6.  real 5.11 (maybe R?) 100'.  Get your stem on and bust out your RPs and small nuts.  Finesse your way to some fixed gear and go straight left on the finger tip traverse with no gear.  Don't fall, then get some gear in and climb the amazingly thin and hollow flake - I am 190lbs and it has held me a half a dozen times so pull away!  Clip a bolt and do a weird mystery slab move and traverse back right to the corner, and climb it to the comfy belay ledge.  Going straight up is the Shadow variation, 12-, RPs. \n  \n p7. 10+ 70'.  All fixed pins and bolts, traverses right a bunch, short crux. \n  \n p8. 11+ 80'.  THE sting in the tail.  Hard and spicey.  Pull a hard slab/mantel move off the belay, go to the head wall and traverse left to the new free bolt.  Clip it and balance your way up the wall to grab the ledge.  Hand traverse till you get to the fixed knifeblade tips traverse and punch it.  Pull on to an easy ledge and don't slip on the pine needles.  Watch for heinous rope drag and belay in the trees. \n  \n You can continue straight up from here on the Roman Chimneys or walk off belly good ledge.\n\nContinue past the base of the Grand Wall as for Seasoned in the Sun.  Keep going for about 2 minutes until you see the bushy ramp that cuts back right and up via a few fixed lines to the obvious STEEP and clean U-wall.  A fixed line is in place for the exposed traverse to the start.  A belay seat is a good idea for P1 and P2 (top of) belays.\n2 sets of gear from micro to Green camalot.  maybe one or two extra finger pieces.  One each Red, gold, blue and big gray camalot.  RPS and nuts, slings and draws.

For us, it was pretty dirty with a decent amount of loose rock, vegetation and required gardening on lead. All in all, I don't really recommend the route... or at least, do the top 25 first and come over here if you're really itching for something new. \n  \n P1 (5.10-): Go straight left on the ledge about 25 feet to the tight dihedral with a continuous crack. Beware the long, skinny flake in the corner at the start, it is not really in there (but you use it anyways). Continue straight up and maybe slightly right through the left end of the roof bands on some ok gear then up a little more to a bolted anchor. (Note: about half way up the pitch, there is a flake that is easy to traverse out left to a ledge. I went over there and it was all mossy and seemed off route). \n  \n P2 (5.11b): The money pitch. Climb seams past 4 or 5 fixed pins to a series of three stacked flakes in the corner that you can either jam or lieback. The seam was rather dirty and grassy so you might want to have your nut tool ready to clean on lead. Finish at a bolted anchor. Recommend to keep going and link to the next anchor as it would be an uncomfortable belay. \n  \n P3 (5.10-): Continue up and right to another bolted belay on a ledge at the base of the main dihedral #3 or #4 to back up since bolts are rusty). \n  \n P4 (5.10): The dihedral pitch. Start out on a 15Â section of wide crack. A #4 might fit but we didnÂt take one. You can place a #3 deeper in one spot or just punch it to the ledge that starts the main dihedral. Climb this left leaning to right leaning dihedral past bushes and loose chockstones. Be prepared to clean on lead and be careful not to dislodge the loose blocks. Topo shows bolt or FP for traverse left at the end but I didnÂt see anything. Grey or yellow alien protects the traverse well. End at bolted belay. \n  \n (From here, the old 2001 McClane book shows the last two pitches as mid 5.10 but I had a different experience, which I will write up here since I spent plenty of time unsuccessfully looking for the documented line). \n  \n P5 (10+ / 11-): Go up and left around the corner from the belay. Punch it through dirty, loose stuff. Place a couple marginal pieces. Pull a hard move to claw some dirt until you can grab the tree root (if you're tall you might not have to jump to it). Yard on this and tie it off, continuing to a really chossy ledge.  I got lost here but I really think you just want to go straight left at this ledge because there is a three bolt anchor over there. I tried to go up and right (as topo indicated) and ended up on a poorly protected slab which I tried to start 4 times before backing off. Then I tried going far right on the ledge, which went nowhere, then finally back left and found that anchor. Book says bold 10c. IÂd say harder than that, chossy and a potentially bad fall on the hard move. \n  \n P6 (5.11- PG13):  Looking up and slightly right from the bolted belay you will see 2 right angling hand cracks (slung horn with fixed biner on top) and a right angling flake just right of these. Choose one (I took the left crack) and climb past the pinnacle, clipping the fixed sling up and left into a dihedral. I thought this dihedral was full-on. Not great gear and really thin, I ended up aiding it using four micro brass offset nuts in little crystals (including the tiny black one) and it still felt sketch. Climb (or aid) this dihedral then pull some thin flake/sport moves up and right to reach the far left end of the dance platform behind some massive boulders. Use the rope to extend the anchor all the way back to a tree (or further to a bolted anchor) and a #1 &amp; #2 behind a chocktone up there and then just use the fixed cordalette as a directional.  \n  \n To get off, traverse right behind the huge boulders to the bolted anchor. Walk the bellygood style ledge to 4th class that takes you up to the roman chimneys start. You can rap from this tree back down to the the far left side of bellygood and escape, or link into upper black dyke or some other route. \n\nJust left of University Wall, starting from the U Wall approach ledge. All of this is about a 5 minute walk left/uphill from the grand wall scramble start. The approach ledge is basically right above Seasoned in the Sun. <br />  <br /> To approach, go up and right on the U Wall approach ledge almost to the end (where U Wall starts). Then scramble up steep 4th class gully past bushes and use an old, ratty fixed rope to go up and left to another little ledge with a slung tree. Belay here to start the climb.\nDouble rack from blue alien to #3 camalot, optional #4 camalot but not necessary (you can also get by with just 1x #3). Full set of nuts (I use offsets, including micro brass hb offsets and I really needed them for the end)."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"LxUlWjjbVtWdddi4tfvh2A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14798,49.68218]}},"createdBy":"sQsg0abRWQefVtwkEaoQew==","_change":{"user":"sQsg0abRWQefVtwkEaoQew==","historyId":"64141ab7f0cf0083295febd0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:45:59.430Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,a354b580-870b-5444-9f11-2c0e78995841,8f267065-fc1a-59ce-bcf1-6e9335548363,2f15255a-38db-56d5-9d75-d8b8b5fbe1d8","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Squamish","Stawamus Chief","Grand Wall Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":9,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":6,"expert":2}},"sport":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":8,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14798,49.68218]},"bbox":[-123.14867496360357,49.681730339818145,-123.14728503639643,49.682629660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"LxUlWjjbVtWdddi4tfvh2A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.14867496360357,49.681730339818145],[-123.14728503639643,49.681730339818145],[-123.14728503639643,49.682629660181874],[-123.14867496360357,49.682629660181874],[-123.14867496360357,49.681730339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the large expanse of granite on the Squamish Chief that includes the Grand Wall route and its numerous variations.
