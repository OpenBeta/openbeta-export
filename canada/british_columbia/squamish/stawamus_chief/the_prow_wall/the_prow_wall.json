All of the pitches are very good climbing, and the two hardest are truly exceptional as they ascend aesthetic features with diverse, athletic, and difficult movement. \n  \n Note: This description begins on the tree ledge one pitch above South Gully. This pitch is described as the start of Gravity Bong/Unbearable. It is 10+/11- and often wet, making it fun in a different kind of way. \n  \n P1 (12-, 35m):  Climb the flare/chimney directly above the bolted anchor that arcs wildly left and spits you out onto bolted face climbing. Continue climbing left to a nice, flat pedestal with a bolted belay. Alternatively, you can traverse left and up along the tree ledge and climb the first pitch of Unbearable to the same pedestal. \n  \n P2 (11c, 35m): A diverse and totally awesome pitch. Climb a steep seam, past two bolts, that opens to a finger crack, then up an off-width to a stance. Clip a bolt and layback/squeeze the arete to another stance below the Elevator Shaft. Climb the Shaft; it's really fun. Belay at a ledge with two bolts. \n  \n P3 (12-, 25m): Very sustained stemming, fingers/tips jams, laybacking, and hip/shoulder scumming up the right-facing corner (the left side of the shaft). At the top of the corner swing right (Unbearable moves left) under the roof, bolt above your head, to a ledge. Jam/layback up the left-facing corner (making sure to save multiple thin fingers-size cams for this section) to some exposed moves to arrive at \"Rancho Relaxo,\" a very nice belay alcove. \n  \n P4 (12d, 28m): A mind-blowing overhanging crack. Climb straight up from the alcove, then traverse right around the corner (be gentle on the stump!) past a bolt to a stance on the exact edge of the prow below the splitter that goes on forever. Start with delicate moves on the hairline seam, then power up the steeper fingers and thin hand jams to a ledge rest. Continue up the crack as it narrows back down, eventually moving left and also using the right facing corner crack, ending at a bolted hanging belay below two lines of bolts. \n  \n P5 (13a, 15m): The Changing Corners. Layback tenuously up to the sharp arete. Channel your inner Houdini to get around it, and then power up some more very powerful laybacking and crimping that eases off as you move to another spacious ledge and anchor. This pitch is fully bolted (5 total), and it would be highly advantageous to have the draws already hung, especially a long draw/sling on bolt 3. (There is also a line of bolts directly up the round corner directly above the belay that you can use as an aid escape.) \n  \n P6 (11c or 12b, 15m): Climb easily if a bit awkwardly up the corner, clip a bolt below the roof, and do a very stretched out, tenuous move to the arete. Pull around the corner to another bolt and do the hero finish up the face to the top of the wall. The grade of this pitch depends greatly on your wingspan. \n  \n From the rim, walk up and climber's right to the 2nd Peak Trail.\n\nTeddy Bear's begins at a bolted belay, below the prominent left-arcing flare/chimney, on the large tree ledge one pitch above the top of South Gully. You can get to this ledge from below per the descriptions of Gravity Bong and Unbearable. You can also hike up the 2nd Peak Trail and rappel the route with a 70m rope, which has multiple advantages. If rappelling in, hike the 2nd Peak Trail to above the ladder. Ascend about 100m more to the first very large flat rock (but still below the 2nd Peak summit). Walk northwest across this flat rock, descend slightly through some trees to a bench above the true edge of the Prow Wall. There are a few different sets of bolts; rap off the brown (rusted?) Metolius rap hangers about 2 meters back from the edge.\nA small set of nuts (#4-#11 BD or so) and a double set of cams from a purple Metolius to .75 Camalot, potentially with triples of the yellow Metolius/.4 Camalot, plus a #1, #2, and #3 Camalot. <br />  <br /> All of the belays are bolted with rappel rings."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"bMBjM/haX0eMnydDYO3hvQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.135,49.6867]}},"createdBy":"Xmq5U1h7U4imn2sTqm1kMA==","_change":{"user":"Xmq5U1h7U4imn2sTqm1kMA==","historyId":"64141bf1f0cf0083295ffb81","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:51:13.630Z"},{"_id":"OQvljdePS0+ljVdIPvLXjw==","name":"UnBearable","grades":{"yds":"5.12-"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Evan Stevens, Jesse Huey (w/Jeremy Blumel and Jasmin Caton)","length":182,"content":{"description":"After climbing 2 of the hard routes on the Prow Wall (there are no easy routes here!) I spotted a line to the top that looked like the easiest way up the Prow wall, thinking it would be nice to do a free route up this amazing piece of stone that wasn't 5.13!  The result is a bit easier, sharing pitches from T-Bears and Gravity Bong, with 4 new pitches of stellar crack climbing. \n  \n p1. 5.11a.  Same as Gravity Bong, originally graded 10c, but expect 11a awkward flare climbing on the bottom half.  At the top go up and right to a bolted belay shared with Teddy Bears Picnic and Gravity Bong. 35m, watch for loose rocks on ledge. \n  \n p2.  5.10c  Walk the ledge at the base of the wall left for 10m or so until you get to a 5.8 ramp with a corner crack that is a little dirty. Go up this for 15m to a stance and then get in the flake crack on the main wall until the nice ledge with a 2 bolt anchor (p. 1 of Teddy Bears joins here.) 35m. \n  \n p3.  5.11c  Same as Teddy Bears p2.  2 bolts on the tips flake/crack and some more cranking bring you to a ledge with a short wide crack.  Up this to stance, clip a bolt, and layback the arete on the left to come to a stance at the base of the amazing elevator shaft.  Stem, double cracks, jam layback up the amazing shaft to a nice ledge and 2 bolt anchor.  40m. \n  \n p4.  5.12a  Starts the same as Teddy Bears but goes up and left through the slot at the top of the shaft.  Tips laybacking and stemming in the brilliant rock gets you to a chimney stem rest.  Bust up and left in the purple camalots out the roof that goes at an easier grade than you would imagine.  Follow the feature up and left until you get to the treed ledge with with a 2 bolt anchor.  40m. \n  \n p5.  5.11, the Gentleman's Flake, harder for small hands.  At the left end of the ledge followed the flake cracks up to the stumps in the overlap flake crack, that can be jammed, laybacked or underclinged, 1 4 camalot at the start of the business and then 3 camalots out the traverse.  Pull on the tree to the 2 bolt anchor.  40m. \n  \n p6. 5.10  Lots of options, the crux is in the first ten feet. then you can either grovel up the chimney with face holds to a 2 bolt anchor (15m) or traverse left past a chopped cedar stump and face climb on cracks and ledges far left to another 2 bolt anchor by a small tree.  Pull over to an awesome top out ledge! \n  \n Walk off towards the first summit across the top of the prow wall to gain the 2nd summit trail above the ladder.\n\nDo any route on the apron (Rock on, calculus or st. vitus are good warm ups) and walk the trail at the top to get to the Ultimate Everything.  Cross under the Kashmir Wall to get to the South Gully.  Go up the gully (kind of gross) past a huge stuck flake/block and pull up on fixed lines on left wall of gully.  Right before the gully dead ends, you will see a flared crack on the left wall.
