The bouldering stretches from the pay campground all the way to the apron, with standout boulder problems and some great sport lines.  \n  \n A great place to be in the summer, because it's always shady and cool, and you'll need those cool temps to stick the myriad of slopers on the heelhooking lip traverses scattered throughout the area.  \n  \n Typical of Squamish, the problems are normally not very high, but despite this the landings can be sketchy because of the many rocks and roots. I like to have a few smaller pads to cover roots and rocks and to fill in gaps as required."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141b81f0cf0083295ff5f5","prevHistoryId":"64141b78f0cf0083295ff56b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":19,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:46:13.018Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:50.354Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
