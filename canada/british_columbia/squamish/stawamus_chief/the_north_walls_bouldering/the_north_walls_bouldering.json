Climb the lazer cut golden corner with increasing difficulty. Get your V on as the corner ends and spits you out onto small sidepulls and edges. Poor feet! Steep with plenty of air beneath you.\n\n\nLocated on the North side of the North Gulley of the Chief, facing Angel's Crest. Hike up to the 3rd summit and parallel the lip until a view of the corner is reached. Rappel off tree or scramble down to a ledge on the lip where two bolted anchors exist. The left one is ideal to fix a line and accesses the belay ledge with a bit of a swing. The right anchor sits freely and more plumb above the route itself and is ideal for setting up a top rope/lowering off.Â \n\nAll natural protection from red Camalot to purple TCU and small to medium nuts. Triples in finger sizes."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"kbANBtW7VQSXH0Qoso8N6g==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1352,49.6876]}},"createdBy":"rVL1etHjUXSpyTAM6i458Q==","_change":{"user":"rVL1etHjUXSpyTAM6i458Q==","historyId":"64141bdff0cf0083295ffa90","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:50:55.034Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,a354b580-870b-5444-9f11-2c0e78995841,8f267065-fc1a-59ce-bcf1-6e9335548363,91b00d06-d5bb-5504-971f-4428b28f0dea","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Squamish","Stawamus Chief","The North Walls (Bouldering)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1352,49.6876]},"bbox":[-123.135895041086,49.68715033981814,-123.134504958914,49.688049660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"kbANBtW7VQSXH0Qoso8N6g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.135895041086,49.68715033981814],[-123.134504958914,49.68715033981814],[-123.134504958914,49.688049660181875],[-123.135895041086,49.688049660181875],[-123.135895041086,49.68715033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"See The North Walls."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141bdff0cf0083295ffa90","prevHistoryId":"64141bddf0cf0083295ffa8a","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:50:53.082Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:00.439Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
