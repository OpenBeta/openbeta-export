It's not always a sport climb and there are certainly places where a fall would be undesirable, but it's better protected than many of the other Apron slabs: no three bolt .10c pitches here. Most of the pitches are 5.11 and your feet and toes will remember the continuous nature of the climbing for at least a few days afterwards. The .12d is completely optional as it's a short, steep boulder problem you can easily pull through.\n\nP1 (.11b): Right off the bat, 'warm up' on a very thin mossy slab that climbs out of the forest above a downed tree. You can start from under/behind the tree but the slab is pretty dirty lower down. I started from a ledge a little higher. As the select book states, it is a rather cruel warmup.\n\nP2 (.10b): Much easier and shorter slab. Belay amongst trees on the ledge.\n\nP3 (.10d): Climb the well-protected slab directly above. 50m long, this pitch feels harder than some of the later .11a pitches. Very sustained. Ends just below Snake.\n\nP4 (.11a): Cross Snake and angle right. Slightly thinner at one point but much shorter than the previous pitch.\n\nP5 (.11d): The business. Move right, then up until you encounter a steepening, thin section. Turn on the magic footwork switch, weld your feet to some miniscule features and hope for the best. Doesn't ease up much until you're clipping the anchor.\n\nP6 (.11a): The guide says .11b; feels more like .10c-.11a at most, maybe because it's much, much easier than the previous pitch.\n\nP7 (.11a): Feet hurting yet? Another thin, low-angle slab leads up to a belay below a steeper section of slab.\n\nP8 (.11b or c?): The guide bills this as another non-descript .11a but I found it to be a major 'sting in the tail'. A bleak bulge of 5.11 glacier glass in the middle of the pitch with a little too much sun on it felt much, much harder than all but the crux slab pitch. Perhaps this is instead the '.11b with a bulge' described as P6 or perhaps my feet were just tired by this point.\n\nP9 (.12d or .9 A0): Glassy and beautiful glacier polish leads to the short, steep headwall. Checking out the moves briefly seemed to put the section at about V6 or so. Bolts are right in your face, so go for it! Dirt on the slab above made the subsequent easier climbing a bit scarier.\n\nP10 (.10a): I think I may have combined this with P9 but I can't recall. In any case, the climbing remains easier but becomes more and more dirty. If I'd had a brush, 10 minutes would have been enough to create an improved path through the thickening murk.\n\n\nApproach as for Diedre but before the trail goes up to the slippery V-groove, head left on another fork. Almost right away, you'll see the big downed tree against the wall. Start right off the ground behind/on top of the tree and fight through moss for two or three bolts, or scramble up a little on the left and step onto the slab there. Rapping the route is an option but P3 is 50m and trailing a second rope would make the climbing less enjoyable. If completing the route, walk off Broadway Ledge as for other Apron routes.\nBolts.

It's mostly bolted, but some cams are pretty much mandatory, and you'll have a piece or bolt no more than 20 feet below you, which sounds good on paper, but keeps you honest when it's for real, but isn't anywhere near as bad as some of the Apron friction horror shows. \n  \n P1: Start as for Diedre but at the horizontal break follow about three bolts to a two-bolt anchor in a concavity. (5.9) \n  \n P2: Climb left and then back right following the line of least resistance and a couple of bolts into some easier terrain to the next two-bolt anchor. (5.8+) \n  \n P3: While it will be tempting to link this with P2, reconsider.  This pitch is the most sustained on the route, although maybe not the crux.  Four bolts take you to a section where the dishes and edges have disappeared and you are back to pure friction, but on a slightly more amenable angle.  Sticking a cam into the undercling crack on the left will feel good (the crack is a part of the route Sickle).  Continue right (possible belay here) and pull the overlap at the tree.  A bolt protects one more thin move to the Sickle Ledge. (5.9) \n  \n P4. Move the belay to the middle of the ledge, just below the continuation of the bolt line.  Follow the bolts to an unclinging arch (a few cams, many options for size).  Get above the arch and continue along the bolt line. (5.10a) \n  \n P5. Slab climbing is about subtlety and here the rock undergoes a subtle change which gives this climb some interesting variety.  It's a minor change, but just as you've dialed-in the friction on the previous pitches, you have to adjust for the more textured but steeper rock here.

Enjoyable but slightly off-balance arete climbing to another bolt anchor.  5.9. \n  \n P7:  Climb super low-angle friction slab, moving left and meeting up with the finish of Diedre in the right-facing corner.  Belay from a tree and walk off.\n\nShares the start of Diedre.\nYou can get a few placements on pitches 1-2.  Pitch 3 has no pro.  You can get a cam under the roof/bulge on pitch 4, and there are a few sparce bolts as well.  Pitch 5 has a few sparce bolts.  Pitch 6 is well-bolted.  Pitch 7 has some placements in the Diedre corner."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"F6aSyJ40VRGQ50TvI9EPoQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14736,49.6863]}},"createdBy":"xiPebjlSWLi5lHszjFgBlA==","_change":{"user":"xiPebjlSWLi5lHszjFgBlA==","historyId":"64141a6bf0cf0083295fe7eb","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:44:43.101Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,a354b580-870b-5444-9f11-2c0e78995841,8f267065-fc1a-59ce-bcf1-6e9335548363,17a692c8-9e34-5511-90e7-44ef23d10fa1","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Squamish","Stawamus Chief","The Apron"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":9,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9-"},{"count":5,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":6,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":3,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":6,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":41,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":11,"intermediate":23,"advanced":7,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":12,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":7,"advanced":5,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":11,"intermediate":27,"advanced":12,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14736,49.6863]},"bbox":[-123.14805502249949,49.68585033981814,-123.1466649775005,49.68674966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"F6aSyJ40VRGQ50TvI9EPoQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.14805502249949,49.68585033981814],[-123.1466649775005,49.68585033981814],[-123.1466649775005,49.68674966018186],[-123.14805502249949,49.68674966018186],[-123.14805502249949,49.68585033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"The Apron is the low angled formation of granite that extends N. off of the Chief. There are many varied climbs on this formation from classic moderate crack climbs like St. Vitus Dance, or Diedre to runout scary slab climbs such as Unfinished Symphony, or Dancing in the Light. The granite in squamish is said by some to be better than Yosemite making it some of the best Granite in the world. The Apron is a wonderful place to climb and contains some of the best moderate routes in Squamish. The views of the sound and the surrounding mountains are spectacular. Some of the first established routes on the chief are on the Apron."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141a6bf0cf0083295fe7eb","prevHistoryId":"64141a6af0cf0083295fe7e1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":51,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:44:12.230Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:59.371Z","updatedBy":"Db8AJw3GUIO8STjcnpMVow=="}
