Mostly finger to tight hands, with a short overhanging chimney crux !\n\nP1 11a: Steep corner dual cracks lead over a tricky bulge to a big ledge. 11a\n\nP2 11c: Beautiful corner. Money. Stem, layback, and grovel up an overhanging chimney crux. 11c\n\nP3 10d: Very fun glory hands lead up and traverse left, before entering somewhat-hollow sounding flakes. Type 1 fun.\n\nP4 11b: Very exposed and *stellar* thin hands, with a great crux! Topout on wide ledge\n\nP5 9: Short fist jamming pitch to trees. Feels like a logical conclusion\n\nP6 11c: If you choose to do it, the true crux. Sweaty rock, ring locks, and odd movement. \n\n\n\nObvious line in the corner up to the right at the base.
