The climb tackles the obvious seam on a crescent shaped wall, getting progressively steeper toward the top of the climb.  The crux for me was a long move near the last bolt, although maybe the pump had something to do with this being the hard part.  The route seems to pack quite a punch for it's relatively short length. \n  \n This is rated 5.12b in the squamish select book, but definitely felt harder to me.  Some of the holds seemed a bit crumbly, so I would not rule out the possibility of broken holds in the past or future. \n  \n I am surprised that the guidebook gives this climb 5 stars, especially in squamish, where there are loads of excellent climbs.  Fun route, but nowhere near 5 stars in my opinion.\n\nOn the far left side of the sanctuary, locate the obvious bolted seam on a wave shaped wall.
