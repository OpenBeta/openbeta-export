This area of sport climbs is only a hop, skip and a jump from the chief and yet the granite is smooth, fine-grained and not inclined toward cracks in the way of the preponderance of Squamish granite. \n  \n The Basement area has some very impressive overhanging sport routes from 11a to 12d.  The West Wing area is a little mellower with three 10s, but also some 11s and a 12a.  Two other crags are in the vicinity: The Loft and The Sanitarium, but I haven't paid them a visit yet. \n  \n This area was developed by Peter Winter and Xander Botha, two guys who deserve a lot of credit for developing a lot of good crags in the Squamish area.  It is covered in Marc Bourdon's ?Squamish Select? guidebook and in Kevin McLane's 2005 edition of ?The Climber's Guide to Squamish? book."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414178bf0cf0083295fc28a","prevHistoryId":"64141785f0cf0083295fc243","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:32:09.490Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:48.335Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
