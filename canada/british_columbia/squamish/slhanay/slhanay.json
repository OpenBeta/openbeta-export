The crux is even thinner and when the corner disappears you really have to battle it out to get the jams to stick.

You can see it from miles away as the left margin of white granite in the center of Slhanay. The crux pitch is bouldery and, at times, sharp from all the quartzite in the Slhanay granite.  \n  \n P1-2: 5.8 crack on the slab, concurrent with Birds of Prey/Eagle's Domain. I think we linked these two but I'm not sure. \n  \n P3 (10b): A corner crack and exposed leftward traverse, same as for Birds of Prey. \n  \n P4 (10c): A couple of bolts and gear lead back up and rightward past an undercling and final traverse to the anchor. \n  \n P5 (11a): A steep, airy bolted pitch leads up the first part of the arete via flakes to a super exposed belay station below the crux. \n  \n P6 (12c): More steep and delightfully (frightfully?) exposed arete climbing with two distinct boulder problems finishes the climb. The rock is sharp on this pitch; I core-shot both our lead rope and one of my fingers on the razor-sharp quartz crystals. Take care especially with how the rope runs at the top of the pitch, as that's where the incident with our rope occurred when I slid off working out the top crux.\n\nThe route starts on Birds of Prey on the obvious, popular 5.8 slab crack left of where the trail meets Slhanay. It departs Birds of Prey after the 5.9 traverse on P3, climbing generally up and right past mixed bolts and gear. It may be possible to rap the route, but two ropes are likely needed and as such it's probably faster to just top out and walk off.\nBolts for the hardest pitch, but standard gear is required for the rest, although perhaps the .11a arete pitch is fully bolted as well. I can't recall if the initial belays are bolted or not, but once on the arete they are."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"izy1itUPVNuaZEJvxLz/Ww==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.12156,49.6945]}},"createdBy":"N2hdnfipUm+vUcA4KK9xEg==","_change":{"user":"N2hdnfipUm+vUcA4KK9xEg==","historyId":"64141802f0cf0083295fc87b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:34:26.243Z"},{"_id":"XHjT/3qfRTOuSBLq8/gNHg==","name":"Free Dimensional","grades":{"yds":"5.13d"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Jeremy Smith","length":27,"content":{"description":"\nClimb the splitter finger crack until it slams shut.

The route would probably get more stars if it were a little cleaner in spots and if one freed all the bolt ladders. As we did this as an 'active rest day' route, we didn't attempt this and in fact freeing the second ladder appears fairly serious besides being difficult. \n  \n P1 (10a): Bolts interspersed with gear lead up the blunt buttress/arete between The Great Game and The Great Drain. A direct start slightly left appears dirty and runout. \n  \n P2 (10c or 11c): A0 or free the bouldery bolt ladder. Head up the slab to the large ramp on Great Game and belay at the bolted station near the tree stump. \n  \n P3 (10c or 12a R): A0 or free the bolt ladder. Free climbing consists of a difficult, thin bulge. It looks like you must then leave the bolt ladder at the third bolt and run out the slab above with a terrible landing on the ramp below if you fall. Pulling through instead, you climb the bolt line and angle left to a hand traverse into the corner, layback the crack, then head up to another bolted anchor. \n  \n P4 (10c or 12a): Another difficult bulge or A0 bolt pulls put you on a slab below another overlap with a crack. Move into the crack. The guidebook says that soon afterwards you move left in another crack across the slab to finish on the Right Wing corner and final steep wide pitch. The slab is dirty and I missed this option, continuing up and right in the main crack to a bolted belay. What could have been enjoyable 5.9 crack and slab is dirt-choked, mossy and kind of awful. A nut tool would have helped mine out the crack and a little brushing on the slab would greatly improve the pitch if climbed this way, making it a nice alternative to joining Right Wing. \n  \n P5: Ordinarily, this would be the .10d 'beak' pitch of Right Wing. What we did was to slab climb past two bolts and traverse a crack to join Skyline Arete (.11a) where you pull on a bolt (or mantle?) over the bulge and do some tricky moves onto the final slab. There's another bolt line with black painted hangers that continues straight above the initial slab that looks dirty but intriguing. This appears to be part of another route that shares the bolted part of P3 with Godforsaken Land and climbs some amazing terrain to the right before rejoining where we belayed below our final pitch. The pitch joining Skyline Arete was the best pitch on the route and if the link crack was cleaner, would be a great alternate P5 for Godforsaken Land.\n\nStart on the buttress between Great Game and Great Drain, passing two bolts. Belays are bolted and it appears that one could fairly easily rap using the black painted anchors, perhaps even with a 70m rope. Having not attempted this, in preference it's better to walk off which is pretty easy and probably faster anyway.\nMostly bolts, but gear is necessary too. How necessary depends on whether or not one finishes on Right Wing, in which case it might be nice to have a larger cam or two. The way we went, a lighter rack works. I can't remember if I ever used the #3 (Camalot) but I doubt it.

This prominent line has caught the eye of many Squamish climbers, especially the residents of Valleycliffe who cannot help but gaze at the steep rock faces above their homes. It was first climbed on September 26, 1985 by Joe Turley and Ted Marks. Over the course of a week, they climbed it ground up, mainly on aid, cleaned the route, and then freed the 60 meter crack in two pitches. Joe being the more proficient crack climber of the team, climbed the first pitch and Ted led the second. Joe and Ted were amateur astronomers and named the route after Halley’s Comet because of their anticipation for its upcoming apparition in the following year. Several generations of tat and fixed gear provided evidence of occasional ascents before the crack was reclaimed by our rainforest and fell into obscurity. This classic splitter likely grew over due to its adventurous nature. It was originally approached from the left, which involved 4th class to low 5th scrambling through a vertical forest. Halley’s Comet now has a new first pitch that provides a pleasant and friendly approach to the base of the long finger and hand crack. A bolt was added to the spicy crux slab finish with approval from Joe Turley and Ted Marks.\n\nPitch 1 (5.7, 30m): Make an exposed traverse left then up a large flake and past several horizontal cracks. A thin traverse left leads to a short wide-hands corner crack ending at a small ledge with a 2-bolt anchor.\n\nPitch 2 (5.10c, 60m): Climb the long and beautiful splitter finger and hand crack.

The first rap anchor is in a chimney climber’s left of the top out and is fairly obvious.\n\nThis route starts after the 4th and final pitch of The Great Game. If you make it all the way to the final anchor of that route, look left and you’ll see an anchor on the low angle slab 10 meters to your left. It’s best to belay from those bolts for Skyline Arête, so go ahead and run out the last few easy meters of The Great Game and head left to that anchor in the first place.\n13 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"izy1itUPVNuaZEJvxLz/Ww==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.12156,49.6945]}},"createdBy":"kU1dPorBUfmNqO22ubicfw==","_change":{"user":"kU1dPorBUfmNqO22ubicfw==","historyId":"64141807f0cf0083295fc8f3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:34:31.806Z"},{"_id":"fYDrTeUvQgCQbEnSeztaOg==","name":"Squeamishness","grades":{"yds":"5.11a"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Harry Young, Robin Barley 2010 FFA: Glenn Woloski, Harry Young 2010","length":152,"content":{"description":"This climb offers 5 pitches of excellent, fairly burly crack climbing.
