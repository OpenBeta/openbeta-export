They tend to be single pitch, but there are a few multi-pitch routes. \n  \n The routes are on generally excellent granite with a great mix of pure crack, friction slab, and delicate face.  There are some overhangs, some wild ones even, but the vast majority of the routes are vertical to slabby. \n  \n The access issue relates to parking. There is an excellent parking lot available (thanks to the BC Climbers Access Society, I believe), but people continue to park in the residential areas anyway."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641419e6f0cf0083295fe141","prevHistoryId":"641419d8f0cf0083295fe072","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":49,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:34:35.413Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:34:37.798Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
