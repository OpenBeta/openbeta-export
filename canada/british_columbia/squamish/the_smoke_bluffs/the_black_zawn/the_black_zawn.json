Get established on the slab above and crank/finesse through insecure moves along the vanishing crack. Good gear but the crux is obligatory. Climbed headpoint style but worthy of an onsight attempt with good gear and rests. Bring small cams and the jewelry. \n\nBig thanks to everyone who gets stoked on our new climbs and continue to encourage us.
