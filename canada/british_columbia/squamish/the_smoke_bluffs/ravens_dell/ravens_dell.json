It's rated one star in the guidebook, and it's understandable why since it's extremely chossy and dirty, and the beginning has tons of ferns and sticks to climb through. However, it's also a four star experience if you're willing to risk the choss and spider webs. How often do you get to climb through a hole and emerge out into the sunlight? Super fun, burly, and dirty! Felt harder than 5.8 to me. \n\nBe very careful what you pull on as there are many loose and jiggly rocks including a very big chunk of rock on the left side of the crux that seems like it could slide of pretty easily since it made grinding noises when touched. Should probably be trundled before being climbed if it's as loose as it sounded. See photo of loose block in the image attached. If you do climb it just be careful of this block and avoid it at all costs, and at the crux it would be better to go right and avoid touching or putting pro around this block.\n\n\n\nThe wide chunky chimney\n\nTrad with anchor at the top"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"rzQEnJbiWTullx49iiY8Tg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14013,49.70615]}},"createdBy":"qdY7zy2VX8Gw9fyyT+Iozw==","_change":{"user":"qdY7zy2VX8Gw9fyyT+Iozw==","historyId":"641419a8f0cf0083295fde11","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:41:28.863Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,a354b580-870b-5444-9f11-2c0e78995841,6ce7b6b0-2215-5f01-af16-9c07c5ec2f38,af34049c-96e2-593b-a597-1e3d8a263c4e","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Squamish","The Smoke Bluffs","Ravens Dell"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.14013,49.70615]},"bbox":[-123.1408253064483,49.705700339818144,-123.1394346935517,49.706599660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"rzQEnJbiWTullx49iiY8Tg=="},"content":{"description":"Area to the right around the corner from Penny Lane"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641419a8f0cf0083295fde11","prevHistoryId":"641419a7f0cf0083295fde0b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:41:26.803Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:10.912Z","updatedBy":"qdY7zy2VX8Gw9fyyT+Iozw=="}
