Where it ends, finish either left up a short corner or take the original finish right a few meters and up to the top.  \n  \n The route is consistently 5.9 except for the crux past the bolt and can easily be done as a 5.9 A0 by pulling on the bolt.\n\nAt the lower end of Funarama Right, left of the straight in thin crack of First Class. A newer mostly bolted line called Armspan climbs directly up to the lower ledge, crosses WC and then climbs between it and FC to the top.

As with most Smoke Bluffs areas is less-than-vertical, but it offers some excellent finger cracks along with undulating slabs.  Some of the slabs are testpieces of the genre.  It is broken into an upper (left) and a lower (right) area separated by a short stretch trail. \n  \n There appear to be quite a number of new routes here too recent to to be in the 2005 McLane guide book.  Most are on the lower crag, although there is one very grim looking bolted slab on the upper crag. \n  \n New route descriptions are likely in the new route binder at Climb On on Squamish.  One new route is on the left side of the lower crag and is distinguished by being just right of the dirty gully and having two or three bolts in the thin and slabby upper half.  It's reasonably fun and goes at about 10c."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641418bef0cf0083295fd31c","prevHistoryId":"641418bdf0cf0083295fd30f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":21,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:37:22.775Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:58.334Z","updatedBy":"UBs1WHs5XQSidmggOHhlFg=="}
