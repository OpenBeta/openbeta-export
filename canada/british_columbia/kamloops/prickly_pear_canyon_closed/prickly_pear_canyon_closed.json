The area features vertical basalt columns on good quality rock up to around 15 meters high. It is not a very big area having only 7 bolted routes and a few trad options, but is well worth a visit. It is a good place to go if you want to avoid the rain of Squamish in the spring or fall. It is in a vary dry area receiving little rain and lots of sun. Since the cliffs are south facing they can be very hot in the summer, but would make a nice evening climb. As with many of the climbing areas in this area, Prickly Pear Canyon receives very little traffic. Watch out for the Prickly Pear cacti which are all over the ground.   \n  \n There is a free guidebook that was made by the Kamloops Climbing Access Fund which includes Prickly Pear Canyon that can be downloaded at there website: climbkamloops.ca"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641402e4f0cf0083295ed531","prevHistoryId":"641402e3f0cf0083295ed527","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":9,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:04:14.201Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:46.855Z","updatedBy":"zih1acNnXZi4BU1boC4TDw=="}
