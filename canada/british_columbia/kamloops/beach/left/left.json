The climb starts with broken ledges and face moves and ventures into the clean-ish hand sized crack above.  Good hand jams lead through a steep section as the crack gets wider. There are loose blocks to the climbers right but these can be easily avoided. The crack comes to ledgy bit where climbers can traverse about 10 ft left into a hand and finger crack that continues upwards on easy terrain to the anchors above. This route was chosen as the rock directly above the first hand crack is loose and less desirable.\n\nThere are many solid gear placement opportunities despite the broken nature of the crack. No runout required.\n\nThis was recently cleaned as of Sept 2021, so it's still a little licheny on the face moves and the occasional loose rock remains. The FA was done with a 70m rope with some length to spare. If you're using a 60, terminate the end of the rope with a stopper knot. I think it should reach, but I did not measure it.\n\nYou could likely meander to the \"exit pitch\" from the anchors if you wanted to also.\n\n\n\nBetween \"Bradycardia\" and \"Never Again\". Leftmost crack beside \"Never Again\" \n\nTrad: Cams from BD C4 0.5 - 3 (single rack or double up on the 2's and 3's.. even a 4 for the wide bit if you want to feel extra safe).
