None totalling more than 30 climbs, but all possessing their own style and feel. The majority of the routes around Kamloops are sport climbs, with some trad lines and boulders thrown in. \n\nThe climbing season in Kamloops is fairly long. If you're willing to brave the cold it's possible to start climbing in March and finish in November. High summer can be a pain, and you'll find yourself dodging sunshine\n\nThe \"Beach\" is easily the most accessible crag in town. Roughly a 20 min drive from Kamloops. It's a great place for beginner sport climbers, with routes from 5.4 to 5.11\n\nAnother local favourite crag, and home to Kamloops' hardest routes is Roche Lake. It's a bit further out at closer to 40 minutes, but it's well worth the drive. With routes from 5.8 to 5.13 this is the heart of Kamloops' sport climbing. \n\nFurther out is Hen House, Kamloops' only granite crag. The climbing here tends toward slab and vertical, with many mixed trad and sport routes. Routes here range from 5.8 to 5.12. 4x4 is recommended for access."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140315f0cf0083295ed7b6","prevHistoryId":"641402e5f0cf0083295ed53b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":10,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:01:11.146Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:48.925Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
