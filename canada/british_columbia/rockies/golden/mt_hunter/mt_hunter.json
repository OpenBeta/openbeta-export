Move left to transition onto the hanging ice and figure out how to get to the front side of the ice. Climb dead vertical ice (you're on a hanging dagger after all) for about 20 meters and then trend right where the angle eases off to an ice belay.\n\nP5 (WI4, 50m) - Climb 3 steps of steep ice with rests in between to a two bolt anchor on the left which may be hard to find. Alternatively build a belay behind the final 5 meters of ice in a sheltered cave.\n\nDescent - One double rope rappel gets you from the top to the P4 anchor. One double 60m rope rappel should get you to the P2 anchor, however be absolutely certain your ropes are touching down and tie your knots. If you built your P4 anchor too high up you will be left hanging on your ropes a few meters above the ledge with no other option but to prussik your way back up while under some massive daggers. Another 60m rappel gets you down P2 to a walk down the snow slope and a final single rope rappel will get you to the base.\n\nHeading West on Highway 1 there is a small pullout exactly 1.3km West of Wapta Rd. This pullout features a cattle gate followed by 10 meters of road that terminates into nothing. There is enough room to park one vehicle off to the side before the cattle gate.<br /><br />Walk 750 meters West along the highway until you come up to a wildlife overpass going over the highway. Before the overpass on your right you should see a gate in the fence, go through the gate, trend left up a hill to gain a ridge. From the ridge drop down left into the drainage and follow the drainage all the way to the climb. Allow for 2 hours if there is snow, and bring snowshoes.<br /><br />Coordinates for the drainage are 51.252977° N, -116.683422°W, coordinates for the base of the climb are  51.263866° N, -116.677036° W.\nStandard ice rack, 12 quickdraws at least"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"vxuphb1VWZGRHqSgJD9Yeg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.68947,51.27955]}},"createdBy":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","_change":{"user":"b0/zwI/CVlCkLl3WdQLY4g==","historyId":"641410e8f0cf0083295f743f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:04:08.112Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,86e31f84-a78c-5dee-8416-f3088133b262,f14e8f46-e264-5dfc-b389-a27363a95eac,bf1ba985-bd55-5991-911e-a4a0243f587a","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Rockies","Golden","Mt.
