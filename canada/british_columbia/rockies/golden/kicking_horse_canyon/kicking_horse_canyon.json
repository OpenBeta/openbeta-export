What more could you want?\n\nP1 50m: Head up the thin (or nonexistant) lower angle ice passing an occasional fixed pin or bolt if you can find them to a 2 bolt anchor below a low angle broken corner.\n\nP2 20m: Either go left from the belay onto rolling ice to a 2 bolt belay on the right where a small curtain of ice forms, or mixed climb up the broken corner following a few bolts to the same anchor.\n\nP3 50m: Head straight up increasingly steepening ice to a massive platform belay with a two bolt anchor.\n\nP4 20m: The crux pitch. Follow 11 bolts through a wild roof traverse of M7+ mixed climbing. As soon as you are able to transfer to the ice after the last bolt should be a belay cave with a 2 bolt anchor. If the ice has closed up this cave continue up on the ice until you are able to build an anchor.\n\nP5 35m: Move out of the belay cave and straight up for steep WI5 ice that is likely sun rotted in sections. Belay off a tree at the top.\n\nDescent: 3 rappels on 70m ropes gets you to the bottom. Top of P5 to top of P3. Top of P3 to top of P1, then to the ground. Tie your knots as the second rappel is almost the full 70.\n\nNote that you MAY be able to climb from P1 anchors straight to the top of P3 with 70m of rope, however the leader would need to know exactly where the anchor is and not meander unnecessarily.\n\nApproach as for Essondale by dropping down onto the train tracks heading East until you are past an obvious giant grey boulder immediately beside the tracks. If you make it to the train signal you've gone about a hundred meters too far.<br /><br />Just past the boulder go straight up the gully until you are directly below the climb, a single belay bolt marks the start of the first pitch.
