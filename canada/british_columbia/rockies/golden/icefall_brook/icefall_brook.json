The first two days consisted of placing bolts for running belays while traversing 600m across the steep slope at the base of the Lyell Wall. Deep snow necessitated snowshoes for travel, and high winds along with fresh snow each night meant breaking a new trail in the morning. Description is based on FA conditions.\n\nP1:  50m, WI5.   30m of steep ice leads to a shoulder, and a belay on the right.\n\nP2:  50m, WI4.   Climb to a belay on the left.\n\nP3:  60m, WI6+  Climb 45m of very steep, sustained, difficult ice, until the angle eases off for the final 15m.  This pitch was very wet, with funky ice structures, and was climbed by headlamp on the FA.  \n\n\n\nLocation: Seige Tactics is on the far left side of the Lyell Wall, and half the battle is just getting there.\n\nApproach: ***All Aspects of the approach are subject to high avalanche hazard*** \n\nAscend the steep slope to the base of the Lyell Wall, coming out just to the climber's right of the Fossen Falls route.  Begin a leftward traverse, staying high.  There are bolts for running belays across the traverse, but the first bolt is out about 80m.  After traversing about 500m you will come to a drop off into a deep gulley.  Rappel 10m into the gully, leaving a fixed line for the way out. Climb steep snow up and left out of the gulley to a bolt, then continue left to another bolt.  From here, another 10m rappel gets you to the start of the route.\n\nNote: You'll want a rope capture device such as a Petzl mini-traxion to ascend your fixed line out of the gulley.\n\nBolts for running belays on the approach, screws for the route"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"xdfdKZ/cUAa2RDj1CSBgBw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.07081,51.88816]}},"createdBy":"IN4B1TYXU0yhG8aSlnJfrg==","_change":{"user":"IN4B1TYXU0yhG8aSlnJfrg==","historyId":"641410ddf0cf0083295f73e1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:03:57.164Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,86e31f84-a78c-5dee-8416-f3088133b262,f14e8f46-e264-5dfc-b389-a27363a95eac,c5d7dd29-9fdc-5006-b644-38f509206007","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Rockies","Golden","Icefall Brook"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.07081,51.88816]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"xdfdKZ/cUAa2RDj1CSBgBw=="},"content":{"description":"Icefall brook is home to some of Canada's largest waterfalls, cascading down the steep valley walls up to and more than 500 meters high.  In the winter time, this is an ice climbers paradise, containing over 25 routes as of 2020, but yet is seldom visited due to the logistics/money just getting there. If you are thinking about planning a trip, spend no less than a week in the cirque (better yet 2) to make the most of your resources getting into the zone and you will be greatly rewarded with some world class ice in a world class setting.\n\nMost people plan a trip in the last half of February, and the first half of March.  The cirque is at a low elevation, and the south facing walls can receive a lot of solar radiation thus you want to be in there before the melt cycles start.  Once the real melt cycles start, the big rig climbs would be pretty scary to climb, where as the smaller, single pitch routes can be climbed well into April I would have to guess, but not the reason to go in IMHO.  Around the 5th of March, Basecamp receives about 5 hours of sunlight (~11:30am~3:30pm), thus heading into the cirque before then would make for a pretty cold endeavor.\n\nSkis or snowshoes are almost mandatory, as well as a stocked basecamp tent(s), a Mr. Buddy propane heater and plenty of extras of your choice make the time winter camping as pleasant as possible.  Plan a basecamp in the only protected zone of the cirque, low down in the trees where you can also walk a short distance to open water (bring a collapsible jug) to keep you from burning up all the gas.  \n\nTwo google resources as well:\n​Planet Mountain​​​\n​Gripped​​​"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641410ddf0cf0083295f73e1","prevHistoryId":"641410dcf0cf0083295f73d7","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:03:52.511Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:03:57.170Z","updatedBy":"kaHRiOFoVeehp7TBDmpnzQ=="}
