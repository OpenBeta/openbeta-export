It is deemed a skiable summit via the Tiger Glacier.  The North Face is a worthy ice climb and the Northeast Ridge is similar to the Emperor Ridge on Robson.   \n  \n The glaciers of this area are often said to have a bigger feel than the rest of the range, more like the Himalaya some say.  Getting there is more of an expedition too."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"641410c4f0cf0083295f7321","prevHistoryId":"641410c3f0cf0083295f7316","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:03:31.616Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:51.733Z","updatedBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw=="}
