Several options, the sustained vertical line on the left would probably be closer to WI4+. After the initial ice section, it will level out. You can anchor and bring up you follower(s) or continue up through another section of ice until you hit a snowfield. Traverse left around the snow and make your way up to good ice for anchoring (will need a 70 meter rope to make it in one go). Gentler ice climbing follows for next pitch to a wooded area to anchor.
