This climb is listed in Yoho National Park since that is the most sensible and common approach.  The hut is managed by the Alpine Club of Canada.  It is a great base camp if you are attempting climb Mount Victoria or Mount Lefroy.  Many people hike to the hut to stay for the night just for the experience.  There is some red tape involved and the hike there isn't easy. \n  \n The hut was built in 1922 and at 9,598 feet it is the second highest permanent structures in Canada.  The hut is a National Historic Site of Canada.  The hut can sleep 24 people on foam mattresses upstairs.  The kitchen has propane stoves for cooking.  There is a good assortment of pots, pans, dishes, mugs, and cutlery.  There is a wood stove with provide wood for heating.  There is a real nice outhouse. \n  \n The hut can be reserved though the Alpine Club of Canada (ACC)  alpineclubofcanada.ca/huts/….  While reserving the hut with the ACC you can also purchase a backcountry permit and bus passes to Lake OHara.  If you dont have a bus pass its about an eight mile hike along a dirt road to Lake OHara.  American Alpine Club (AAC) members can purchase a Canadian Hut Upgrade from the AAC and save a little bit of money on the hut. \n  \n From Lake OHara it will take four to five hours for an in shape person to reach the hut.  During the hike youll gain about 3,000 feet.  The hike is pleasant until Lake Oesa.  After Lake Oesa is when youll start working your way up a scree slope.  The route is well marked in this area with blue rectangles painted on rocks.  Youll go through a narrow scree gully then across to rock ledges.  Past the rock ledges there is a trail that will take you to the base of the main large scree slope that will take you up to the pass.  In the main scree slope youll gain 1,150 feet of elevation.  Plan to spend some quality time in the scree slope that one climber charmingly called a real meat grinder.  There isnt a route so just keep working your way up the scree slope.  I only caught a few glimpses of the hut while on the scree slope.  The hut is on climbers left.   Helmets are STRONGLY recommended.  Depending on conditions an ice axe and crampons may be required.  Trekking poles can make the scree slope a little easier. \n  \n The weather can change quickly.  It can snow anytime of the year.  Be sure to keep an eye on the weather and go prepared.  This is in an alpine environment and it should be considered a serious undertaking.\n\nHelmets are a real good idea for the scree slope.

Caution: I believe that GoogleEarth incorrectly labels Mt Huber as \"Wiwaxy Peaks\" ). I know we initially were still too low on the face to easily gain the glacier, but got a great view of the icefall (\"Photo #4\").  I don't remember any difficulties climbing up the W Ridge to get to the correct level.\n\nUp this glacier to the open-area \"basin\" between Huber and Victoria.  Climb whichever gully looks easiest (snow/ice/rock, not necessarily in that order!)  to gain the main (N-S) ridge of Victoria.\n\nTurn left (north ?) and follow the knife-edge-at-times ridge (photo) to the summit of Mt Victoria.\n\nDescend the route.\n\nAscent is 6000+ vertical feet.\n\nHistory \n\nFA by a party (listed above) in Aug 1909 who seemed to have climbed on rock up the final wall (west face of Victoria). Listed in Putnam-Boles Guide to Rocky Mts Canada 1973 as SW Arete of Victoria, route#3 pg 192.  The West ridge (\"arete\")  of Huber was first climbed by the Stone-Schaufelberger party in 1913 to reach the summit of Huber.\n\nWe had attempted Victoria from the Abbot Pass Hut several days before but were unsuccessful due to a combination of slowness on the \"lose-slate-on-a-steep-roof\" conditions that none of us had experience with, and treating it as a rock climb and leaving the crampons behind. That being said, I feel the direct ascent from Lake O'Hara as described is a better route.  Since one returns the same way, a planned bivi at the col or on the W Face would shorten the day a bit.  You'd want to scout the condition(s) of the Victoria gully(s), and this could probably(?) be done from somewhere on Mt Odaray.\n\nWe descended from this \"12,000 ft day\" (6,000 up, 6,000 down) - one of the best days I have ever had in 50+ years of climbing mountains - to be told there was an emergency phone call for one of our party.  The call-back proved most sad.  Ed Nester, a good friend of every one of our party had died attempting the first ascent of the NorthEast Ridge of Mt. Austerity in the Adamant Range of the Selkirks.  A refrigerator-sized block being used as a rappel anchor had broken off, sending him down several hundred feet into the bergshrund. His partner, Julius Bede, was left on the ridge without rope.  He was rescued three days later by helicopter. Fortunately, there had been another party at the hut and they were able to send someone out to summon the rescue and the RCMP. (This was pre-sat-&amp;-cell phones, and even a radio was rare. )\n\nsee photo\nSmall Alpine\" Rack, today I'd take 0.5 through #2 Camalots, long slings and cord to rap off boulders, maybe some \"disposable\" nuts - Much class 3 \"no fall\" climbing on W face Huber and along Victoria's ridge.
