The difficulty of this route depends greatly on the condition of the gargoyles - if the snow is in bad condition retreat is the only option.\n\nHere's a few things to know:\n\nThe lower part of the route up to the Black Towers is mostly rock with small bits of ice to cross. We encountered climbing up to about 5.7 but most of it is much easier. There are few good anchors and plentiful loose rock. We stayed near the left side of the face. It's possibly to avoid some of the harder climbing by climbing on the lower angled terrain to the right.\n\nWe passed the Black Towers through a chimney on the left - this seemed fairly obvious. The only fixed gear we found on the route was a pin at the top of the chimney.\n\nOnce you attain the ridge proper you have to deal with a number of vertical steps and nearly a mile of often questionable snow gargoyles to reach the top.

There once was a huge serac that loomed over part of the face, but glacial wasting has now removed the threat.  Currently, this is probably the safest way to climb Robson.  \n  \n Remote climbing with low odds for success given the weather, snow conditions and logistics. Still once you get your shot, moderate to steep snow and ice climbing up the Kain Face and then moderate climbing up snow and ice faces and around gargoyles of ice leads to a large summit with a small summit bump.  \n  \n If you think getting up is tough, getting down can be a job once the Kain Face softens and becomes very hazardous to downclimb. Be prepared to sit it out till the sun goes down and the freeze comes to stabilize the face. Do not underestimate the decent.  \n  \n It is all worth it! \n\nYou can approach on foot all the way from Berg Lake to the Dome, or fly into the Extinguisher (this is easily arranged with companies out of Valemont, BC) and then travel over glacier to the Kain Face camp at the Dome. The approach hike is on a good trail.  Mountain bikes are even allowed as far as the first ten kilometers, to the shelter past Kinney Lake.  <br />  <br /> Take the time to climb Mount Resplendent before taking on the ice fall of the Resplendent/Robson glacier.  This can be bypassed by climbing the ridge above the ice fall and working your way back to the glacier once you overcome the ice fall.

Once again we returned the same way, although we waited for quite some time before starting down the sunlite slopes. We couldn't find the beautiful gully so ended up rapping the rock face itself.

Please don't let the presence of a hut give you a false sense of security.   \n  \n Two thousand feet above the safety of the hut, an almost perpetually broken, unstable, and overhanging serac can let loose deadly ice block avalanches onto the route's crux.  There is no managing the risk completely with pre-dawn timing and freezing temperatures because the unpredictable movement of the glacier can shrug off huge amounts of ice onto the Schwartz Ledges at any time.   \n  \n Starting in January of 2016, the camping reservation system may make it very difficult for climbers to honestly and simply just hike in to the safer Kain Face when the rare good conditions occur.  If this system fails to work for non-heli' climbers, then the South Face might appeal.  Personally, it calms me to think of the South Glacier's serac cliff as the Kumbu Ice Fall of North America, a proven killer guarding a prize no climber can resisit. \n  \n Remember Pete Steers who worked at Neptune's?  We talked just after he soloed this route.  He just zoomed up from Boulder when conditions were great and thought the South Face was one of the best climbs of his career.  Another good reason this route is favored by both soloists and some teams descending the North Faces is that the south side requires less travel on crevassed glaciers. \n  \n ROUTE DESCRIPTION \n                        Robson's South Face Route No one else calls it the \"Roof Glacier\".  It is really called \"the Roof\" (a special name for the upper South Glacier).  contour interval 20 meters       \n The first day is usually spent climbing to the Ralph Forster Hut.  After leaving the trail at the creek that drains the Great Couloir, a long climb roughly follows the steep rib forming the south boundary of the Great Couloir (GC).  Leaving the creek bed of the GC is made difficult by a 100 foot rock band - dodge right.   \n  \n After 3,000 of steep hiking, rock work, a ladder, and ,hopefully, cut vegetation, the Black Wall forces the route left.  Cairns lead one to some wet ledges.  These ledges have a rappel anchor at the top (easy 5th class). Above the Black Wall, aim right/south for the ridge-step formed by the the Black Headwall.  A 5.3 chimney climbs the step and then the ridge crest is followed to the Hut (Sean Dougherty, Selected Alpine Climbs, 1991).  Others have described a rising traverse left to dodge the Black Headwall.    \n  \n Above the hut, the south ridge is climbed past Little Robson, scrambling with crest bypasses. Then the crux, traversing left across the low 5th class Schwartz Ledges, directly in the line of fire from the ice cliff (photos).  Getting closer than 70 meters to the ice cliff is a route finding mistake!   \n                        Upper South Face  photo by Mountain Project contributor John Peterson 2012       \n Some say your only under the hazard for less than 20 minutes when the ledges are dry.   \n                        Schwartz Ledges, August 2007 \"We didn't bother to stop and belay...\"  submitted by Mountain Project contributor Martin le Roux, 2015       \n Once past the calving ice, some used to do a long traverse under the Roof (uppermost south glacier) in order to join the Kain Route on the southeast ridge.  Instead, more climbers seem to be going up directly via weaknesses near the ice feathers on the west side of the Roof Glacier.   \n  \n Recently, there have been years where bare ice on the Kain/Southeast Ridge made down-climbing too difficult.  Instead, rappels are done off v-threads west of the ridge - more directly down the roof anyway.  So it seems there is no reason for the long traverse to the SE Ridge anymore.  \n  \n Metric elevation gain, hut to summit; 1,400 meters. \n  \n DESCENT \n Be ready to place rappel anchors in icy conditions.  If instead there is snow, it may be okay to down-climb the steep upper slopes all the way to the Schwartz Ledges.  \n  \n Some teams have stayed above the ice cliff, descended the glacier, and then done one or two long rappels down the serac ice cliff.  The goal is to land the rappel on the ridge above Little Robson, without triggering an ice collapse.    \n  \n Otherwise, you get to reverse the traverse of the Schwartz Ledges, again under the threat of calving ice.  \n  \n The rest of the descent is simply reversing what has already been done.  \n                        Descending steep snow above the Schwartz Ledges after climbing the Emperor Ridge!  by John Peterson 2012       \n  \n LINKS \n To get the best current conditions check the mountain condition reports at Association of Canadian Mountain Guides.    \n  \n Bill Kerr's telephoto of the ledges and serac @ Summit Post   \n  \n Chris Guolet's photo of The Roof  shows how the route is trending left of the southeast ridge.

Like all great peaks, there is no easy way to the summit. The famous Austrian guide Conrad Kain, author of the first two routes on Robson, proclaimed upon first sight of the peak, \"God made the mountains, but good God! who made Robson?\"\n\nThis complex mountain has many distinct characters, depending on the aspect. The North Face is known for its steep ice walls, the south side for complex, \"gargoyle\" studded rock &amp; snow ridges, and the legendary Emperor Face, rising over 9000' from the valley below, for its daring mixed lines that push the limits of modern alpine abilities.\n\nAlthough the \"Wishbone Arete\" was selected for Steck &amp; Roper's \"Fifty Classic Climbs of North America\", this is generally considered a poor choice by Canadian Rockies &amp; '50 Classics' connoiseurs alike, as a number of better lines exist on the peak. Sean Dougherty, author of \"Select Alpine Climbs in the Canadian Rockies\" calls the line \"...somewhat over-rated considering the amount of loose rock &amp; the long approach.\"\n\nThe mountain's impressive size and intimidating vertical relief make one-day ascents uncommon. Weather is a major factor in this part of the Canadian Rockies, and the mountain is said to create its own weather. Some years the mountain may not be climbed at all, and in one 14-year period from 1939 to 1953, the mountain did not receive a single ascent!
