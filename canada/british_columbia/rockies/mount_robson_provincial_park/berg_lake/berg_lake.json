From a stand start on the southeast face of the boulder, grab a good right hand sidepull and left hand sidepull, and smear. Bump right hand up to another sidepull, and thrutch to the lip. Astonishingly technical for how short it is. Beautiful.Â \n\nDownclimb the north side of the boulder, which could also be climbed up at V0-\n\nGlacier Mama, take me home...\n\n\n\nFrom the Berg Lake Campground, hike past the Rearguard Campground, and take a right at the fork in the trail, towards Robson Glacier. Stay to the left of Robson Lake and along the hillside you'll find this beauty sticking up out of the rubble. \n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"X2svW1BhU9at30wOA4tg1w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.15501,53.15452]}},"createdBy":"tR2zihygXymF/1Pi0Pltwg==","_change":{"user":"tR2zihygXymF/1Pi0Pltwg==","historyId":"641410fcf0cf0083295f74eb","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:04:28.988Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,86e31f84-a78c-5dee-8416-f3088133b262,871b9c14-068e-5307-b3b9-0d2af10bde07,5f6b2f5b-5061-53d6-addf-4c0e038b60d7","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Rockies","Mount Robson Provincial Park","Berg Lake"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"v2"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.15501,53.15452]},"bbox":[-119.15575985979316,53.154070339818134,-119.15426014020684,53.15496966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"X2svW1BhU9at30wOA4tg1w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.15575985979316,53.154070339818134],[-119.15426014020684,53.154070339818134],[-119.15426014020684,53.15496966018185],[-119.15575985979316,53.15496966018185],[-119.15575985979316,53.154070339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"A glacier lake at the base of Mt Robson and Rearguard Mtn."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641410fcf0cf0083295f74eb","prevHistoryId":"641410fbf0cf0083295f74e5","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:04:26.671Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:55.427Z","updatedBy":"tR2zihygXymF/1Pi0Pltwg=="}
