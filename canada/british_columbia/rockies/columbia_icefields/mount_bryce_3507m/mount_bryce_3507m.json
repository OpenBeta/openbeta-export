Outram's guide, Christian Kaufmann, was climbing at his limit and basically soloed the crux.  The 1902 party approached up the Alexandria River to a camp at Cinema Lake.  The central peak was bypassed to the south.   \n  \n APPROACH  \n    \n The Bush River Road begins near Donald, BC.  Turn onto the Rice Brook Road at the 98 kilometer sign.  Four kilometers of increasingly bad road lead to the decommissioning  closure.  Good 4wd will shorten the hike.  The last roadside campsites are off on a short spur near the 68 kilometer sign. \n  \n THE CLIMB \n  \n Hiking the old road is tougher than a trail because it was dug up and is getting vegetated. After a few kilometers an old bridge site is reached.  Easier crossing may be found at bit upstream. Two more kilometers of overgrown road are followed to a moraine crossing.  Another kilometer of logging track leads to the end of the logging.  Then a cross-country climb of 3,500 feet is required to reach the crest of the Northeast Ridge at 9,600'. \n  \n The ridge is used to traverse two sub-summits, the Northeast and Central peaks, on the way to the top of Mount Bryce.  The Northwest Peak is the true summit (11'506). \n  \n The crux climbs a step on the ridge of the Northeast Peak.  A 25 meter pitch up a smooth gray buttress, 5.6.  Easier snow and rock complete the climb of the Northeast Peak.   \n  \n The second false summit, the Central Peak, is tackled directly up it's northeast ridge too.  The Central Peak can be dodged by traversing glacier on the south side of the ridge. \n  \n The final northeast ridge of the Northwest Peak climbs almost 1,000' to the summit. Several roped pitches can be done to the top. Getting around the spectacular cornices is best done with good front-points, two tools, long screws and snow pickets."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"xrelIR5QVr2R+MFDd3U2Yg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.33,52.041]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"641410cdf0cf0083295f7353","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:03:41.689Z"},{"_id":"JY5dSCbCQOeKAT17ES8FhA==","name":"Rice Cooker","grades":{"yds":"5.11-"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Eliel Bureau-Lafontaine, Robert Thibault, July 2nd, 2021","length":242,"content":{"description":"\nOpened near the end of the 2021 Heat Dome, Rice Cooker was freed ground up, On Sight during extreme heat and thunder storm which added some spices to the meal ! \n\nThe climb follows the obvious weakness splitting the center of the wall and features roof cracks, chimney, corners and loose engaging face climbing. \n\nP1: Up a run out diagonal crack to a loose sloppy ledge. 5.9\n\nP2:Traverse Left aiming for the roofy hand crack. 5.10+/11-\n\nP3:Go straight up if you dare !

Also, the most popular way.  However, the key couloir is a rockfall hazard.   \n  \n I would suggest that the 1902 route may be more pleasant than thrashing your way up the hillside to Bryce's South Glacier.  \n  \n APPROACH \n  \n The Bush River Road begins near Donald, BC.

Then another two kilometers until leaving the old road at the last clear-cut, about 5,200'.   \n  \n An arduous climb starts up the mountainside.  Steep forest leads to a narrow watercourse. Climbing the loose rocks of the dry stream-bed is still steep, but better than the bushes on either side. At about 7,000', a cliff and waterfall are dodged by moving left across more steep, loose, slopes.  The South Glacier camp is reached at 7,700'.  \n  \n TECHNICAL CLIMBING \n  \n The broken lower South Glacier is avoided by staying left.  Then snow and ice are climbed up a couloir that cuts through cliffs, left of a big serac cliff, 9,000'. The gully exits onto low angle neve, 10,200'.   \n  \n From the broad neve there are two choices of route.

Like the Southwest Face of Mount Assiniboine, new logging roads have caused the rediscovery of an old and once forgotten route. Rockfall hazard in the South Glacier Couloir is a risk reported by some who have written about this shortcut.  \n  \n The west face has been climbed from Rice Brook by at least one obscure route.  Photo by wlloyd @ summitpost \n  \n The North Face climbs 7,500 feet from Bryce Creek.  Similar to Robson's North Face; loose rock for the first half and steep alpine ice to the top.  Bryce's middle peak has a nordwand route too.  \n  \n The north face of the Centre Peak was climbed in 1977.  Kruszyna &amp; Putnam's 1985, AAJ &amp; CAJ guide to the Canadian Rockies says a 5.8 pitch began the climb to the right side of the giant serac in the photo.  Then a 65 degree traverse dodges another serac (no direction given!) and easier front-pointing directly to the summit.    \n  \n TRAIL MAINTENANCE \n  \n The decommissioned logging road up Rice Brook is overgrown and needs to be recommissioned for climbers.
