The larger of the two, Hueco Wall (named after the distinctive hueco features found on the wall), has more traditional climbs some of which are 2 pitches long.   The shorter more compact cliff, Nathan's Wall, has a number of fingery climbs on good rock, but with very sharp compact holds."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414111ff0cf0083295f7631","prevHistoryId":"6414111df0cf0083295f7620","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:04:59.540Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:19.940Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
