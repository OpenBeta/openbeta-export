Imagine large granite spires of all shapes and sizes surrounded by beautiful glaciers and mountains as far as the eye can see and that's the Bugaboos.  All the rock is alpine granite and the quality on most routes is superb, even those which are not considered classics.  Routes range from a few hundred feet tall to a few thousand and offer anything from ridge scrambles and moderate free climbs to hard test pieces and multi-day big walls.\n\nThe climbing season is generally June to September with July and August having the best chance of good weather.  But be prepared for any kind of weather, it can storm at anytime and it snows every month of the year.  Temperatures can vary greatly depending on what side of a spire you're climbing on (North, South, East, West), if the sun's out or not, or if it's windy so plan accordingly.  An ice axe and crampons are mandatory to be safe especially later in the season when the glaciers can become a little more troublesome to negotiate due to melting.  Glacier travel skills are recommended for getting to and from most climbs unless you're staying near the campground.\n\nThere are several options for staying in the park when you are visiting.  The most comfortable but also the most expensive is the Conrad Kain Hut which is managed by the Alpine Club of Canada and will cost you $25 a night (Canadian) per person as of 2013.  But provides you with a warm dry place to hang out in foul weather, a kitchen with running water and lights for late night reading.  Other more cost effective options are the campgrounds, with the Applebee campground being the most popular by far.  It will cost you $10 (Canadian) a night per person (pay at the Kain hut) and is basically a large area of somewhat flat rocks to place your tent on.  It does offer you a toilet, racks for hanging gear and food and great views which make the price seem more reasonable."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"mhOLYfncR7Krr7hj7XyOuw==","historyId":"65b919637fb5d7edf06a889d","prevHistoryId":"6413fabff0cf0083295e777f","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":17,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T02:14:44.154Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:54.642Z","updatedBy":"mhOLYfncR7Krr7hj7XyOuw=="}
