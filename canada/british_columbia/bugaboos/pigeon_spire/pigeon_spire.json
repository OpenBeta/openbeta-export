My partner and I were able to do the climb in 11 pitches by stretching out a 60m rope.  The following pitch descriptions are how we climbed the route. \n  \n P1/2:  Start near the left side of the East Face and climb a right-angling flake and crack system for one pitch.  Then continue up more cracks to the left end of a large ledge (5.7). \n  \n P3:  Traverse to the right side of the ledge and look for a broken-up crack and ledge system that goes up and left, belay here. (4th class) \n  \n P4/5:  Climb up the left-angling cracks/ledges and belay below a small roof.  Continue up a nice splitter that curves left and belay on a large ledge.  This is a variation to the original route but is much better quality (5.9). \n  \n P6:  Climb up a left-facing dihedral to a ledge, continue up a crack that will probably be wet until you get to a slab, then make some thin moves up and right to an anchor made out of old pins and slings.  (The anchor is set in a seeping crack and the slings are in really bad shape, it might be better to belay below the slab before the crack ends). (5.7 or 5.8+ if you climb up to the anchor) \n  \n P7:  This is where the real fun starts.  Traverse right for 100' or so with only about three places for pro along the way till you get to a left-facing dihedral.  Down climb to a small ledge and set up a belay.  (We stretched this pitch past the dihedral and were force to set up a really bad anchor that was more looks than anything, not recommended). (5.8/9). \n  \n P8:  Traverse right over the dihedral and climb up on an unprotected face for about 20' till you get to some marginal cam placements and a pin a little higher up.  Continue up a crack with good pro to a small ledge with two pins and belay.  (The book shows a possible tension traverse here that would get you over the dihedral but when my partner pulled on the anchor point for the traverse it ripped out.  It was an old copper head, so I don't think that's an option anymore unless it's replaced). (5.10)  \n  \n P9:  Traverse down and right to a crack at 5.10+, or tension to the crack at A0.  Follow the crack up into a left-facing dihedral that gradually gets steeper until you get to a good ledge and belay.  This is the technical crux of the route if done free. (5.9 A0 or 5.10+) \n  \n P10:  There are several options here; we took the crack that splits the middle of the face but there is another crack to the left that would work to.  This pitch tops put on a wide ridge either way you go and is covered in lichen. \n  \n P11:  Follow the ridge up and west with no obvious route, but you should be on the north side of the spire crossing to the south side at a notch in the ridge.  Continue traversing west till you get to an exposed ledge that ends at a 800' drop down the south face.  Climb up a corner with loose rock above the ledge and your on the summit.  (We simul-climbed this ridge and belayed the last corner to the summit).\n\nThe East face of Pigeon Spire is obvious from the Bugaboo Glacier.  Follow a climbers trail west through loose rock to the Bugaboo Glacier, passing the south side of Snowpatch.  Continue up the Glacier slightly to the south of the Pigeon Spire to avoid some large crevasses.  Traverse north above the crevasses and drop into a small bergshrund to get to the start of the route.\nA standard rack of cams from blue or green Alien up to 3\" and a set of nuts should suffice.  A 3.5\" piece might be useful."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"+b0lvb/NVnqFgfsZ+G27Mw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.785,50.7189]}},"createdBy":"Fbp7NvD0VWOgK1u8LtaTQw==","_change":{"user":"Fbp7NvD0VWOgK1u8LtaTQw==","historyId":"6413faa7f0cf0083295e7635","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:11.665Z"},{"_id":"x4olKrd/Qoi6sVPCqBguOg==","name":"Draco","grades":{"yds":"5.12-"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Craig McGee /Josh Lavigne Aug/2018 (With help from Marc Piche and Jesse Bouliane in 2016/17)","length":242,"content":{"description":"This route is found on the South face of Pigeon and eventually climbs the huge golden dihedral on the upper headwall in an amazing position!! The start follows lower angle cracks and corners until the mid-way ledge is gained and then the real climbing begins. The upper pitches of the route are quite Yosemite-esqu, with lots of “meat and potato” jamming and enduro pitches.\n\nRack:\nDepending on your comfort and jamming abilities on the crux enduro pitch, a double rack from micro cams to BD #4 should suffice. Although, a number #5 camalot is optional for pitch 1, 5 and 6. More small to med cams can be used on these pitches too.\n\n1) 5.9 (59m)\nStep out of the moat and climb up the furthest right crack that gains the ridge the earliest. Once you gain the ridge, climb up a few metres of off-width (optional #5) and then clip a bolt on the ridge and move back left and up deteriorating cracks just left (west) of the ridge until you attain the belay at 59m. Place your protection wisely so you don’t have too much rope drag.\n \n2) 5.10 (45m)\nAwkwardly climb down and over to the left facing dihedral. Climb up this corner and pull a committing move out left  around a small roof lip (crux). When over the lip, follow the right corner and cracks up and to a belay just below a prominent ledge.\n\nMove the belay up and slightly left to the base of the low angle cracks.\n\n3) 5.8 (50m)\nClimb up the crack of your choice. Once you have pulled into lower angle terrain, follow the corners heading up and left to find a bolted belay at 50m.\n\nMove the belay over to the base of a small arch below a series of left leaning flakes. This is directly below the prominent golden corner.\n\n4) 5.10 (20m)\nClimb a few metres directly above the belay until you can place a cam and make a few delicate and committing moves left and up to a bolt. Continue delicately up some bongo flakes (another bolt) until you can undercling up and left to a down-sloping ledge. Clip a bolt and head down and right until you can clip another bolt and pull up onto the slab and to the belay below the golden corner.\n \n5) 5.12- (or 5.11- A0) (40m)\nBoulder through a vicious height dependant crux and then make your way up the amazing Yosemite like golden corner. Up higher in the corner switch from the right to left cracks. If free climbing the crux, aid up to the second bolt and then return to the ledge to protect yourself from a ledge fall. The boulder problem can easily be aided through with two moves of A0. The pitch takes a variety of gear from small TCU’s to an optional #5\n\n6) 5.11+ (50m)\nThe money pitch and the pitch you came for! Step up right from the belay and into the amazing “Yosemite-chug and plug” enduro crack. The pitch takes a variety of gear, from small TCU’s to an optional #5. One bolt protects the mid-way crux which can either be laybacked or jammed on insecure shallow flares.\n \n7) 5.10+ (40m)\nStep left and make your way up the awesome splitter hand crack in the Golden headwall!!\n\n8) 5.10 (45m) (or many options.)\nMake your way up the deep V groove caped by roofs, take care while gingerly passing a precarious looking flake. Once under the roof, head right and traverse to a thin crux exiting the roof. Head up the first crack after the roof and belay on the next major ledge. Manage your rope and protection placements wisely or you will be fighting rope drag.\n\n9) 5.8 (30m) (many options)\nStep right and up flakes and cracks to the next ledge and belay.\n\n10) 5.10 (30m) (many options)\nThe first ascent team continued straight up through small cracks and mossy slabs to finish on a perfect finger crack that pulls directly onto the summit.  Other easier options are available.\n\nDescent:\nAll belays are bolted for rappels.\n\nScramble 100m down the east ridge until you can follow a ledge system on the south side back to the last bolted belay. You can make a 60m rappel from the top of pitch 5 to the mid-way ledge.  \n\n<br />The route is found on the South Face of Pigeon. It starts from the midway glacial bench a couple hundred metres up from the actual toe and where will find two large left facing (west facing) corners. The route starts in the furthest west corner, just to the right of a prominent arch. The climb doesn’t start in the corner itself, instead  start in the center of the right wall (facing west), in the most right hand crack that gains the ridge the earliest.\nDepending on your comfort and jamming abilities on the crux enduro pitch, a double rack from micro cams to BD #4 should suffice.

The route is not technically difficult, consisting of mostly 4th-class scrambling but the position and exposure are spectacular.  The route follows the top of the ridge nearly the whole way climbing up and over two intermediate summits before topping out on the true summit.  Simul-climbing the ridge is probably the best option if you want to go faster and still stay safe. \n  \n From the low point on the ridge scramble east to the first summit staying near the ridge-crest, sometimes to the south, sometimes to the north but never more than a few yards away.  At the top of the first summit follow slabs down to a saddle and then continue up the ridge toward the second summit.  Again stay near the crest until you get to a steep section that is avoided by following a ledge to a corner on the north side of the ridge.  The corner will lead you up to the second summit from which some easy fifth-class down climbing to the north will end at a col between the second and main summits. \n  \n From the col, move left beneath the summit following icy ramps till you get to the bottom of slab angling up to the right.  Climb up the slab continuing up a chimney to a loose gully on the left.  Climb up the gully until you get to a 10\"-wide left-angling crack.  Step right to a large flake and chimney and then back left to a 5.4 handrail.  Follow the handrail for about 12' and make a reachy move up and right to easier ground that leads to the summit.  \n  \n To descend either follow the same route down from the summit or make two single-rope rappels off the summit back down to the icy ramps.  From there follow the same route back down the ridge.\n\nFrom the Kain hut and Applebee campground go up the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col and follow the Upper Vowell Glacier west toward Pigeon Spire.  Walk past the Pigeon Spire to the north to the highest point of the Vowell Glacier and scramble south to the crest of the West Ridge.  There is actually an outhouse near the ridge with signs leading to it, so if you see those signs then you're in the right place.\nA very small rack is all that's needed consisting of a set of nuts and one set of cams to 3\"."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"+b0lvb/NVnqFgfsZ+G27Mw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.785,50.7189]}},"createdBy":"Fbp7NvD0VWOgK1u8LtaTQw==","_change":{"user":"Fbp7NvD0VWOgK1u8LtaTQw==","historyId":"6413faaaf0cf0083295e7663","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:14.967Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,26913742-ffc5-5c8f-834b-7f0cd1b58d81,f9bd25bd-bfcd-567a-8581-fb19f86dbb33","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Bugaboos","Pigeon Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.785,50.7189]},"bbox":[-116.78571022274343,50.71845033981814,-116.78428977725655,50.71934966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"+b0lvb/NVnqFgfsZ+G27Mw=="},"content":{"description":"The Pigeon Spire sits to the west of Snowpatch Spire dividing the Bugaboo and Vowell Glaciers.
