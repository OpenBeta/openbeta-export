The crux was done in the rain, so that may contribute to \"grade-flation\". Technically, also \"A-0\" or \"A-1\" as there is at least one rap during the \"ascent\".  \n  \n Climbs along the ridgeline (and occasionally a bit to the side) of a most amazing knife-like horizontal blade of granite. Hold up you hand, sight along the axis of your extended fingers, then enlarge by a factor of 10,000 (or so !?) and this is the geographical structure of the Archduke Trio.  \n  \n Not recommended if there is likehood of thunderstorms! Both shelter from lightening and retreat down either face is problematical.  \n  \n START: On the right, north (see photo#2) with easy scrambling for a while to where the technical climbing starts.  \n    After the first summit, move along right to a short rap into the notch. Climb up to the 2nd summit.  \n    Descend into a notch, then traverse horizontally (for 2 pitches?) on the north (right-hand) face. Then climb up the face (technical crux) to the 3rd summit.  \n    Rap from 3rd summit down ridgeline [photo#1] to glacier. (3 raps)\n\nApproach from the lower Vowell glacier, moving up into the cirque and head right for the start.(photo)\nUsual alpine stuff, lots of long over-the-shoulder-and-longer slings to sling spikes and boulders. Infrequently done (In 1982 we thought we were doing the 2nd ascent, but it probably was the 3rd.) so don't expect fixed rap anchors."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"GbsnCalvXCCV3Yr7bmJO+A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.81262,50.76981]}},"createdBy":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","_change":{"user":"6hlYMstFWjOTOjBz1yM3+A==","historyId":"6413fac3f0cf0083295e779b","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:39.769Z"},{"_id":"6dXUEL+rTEmnCgBwDcxsjw==","name":"East Face, South Wallace","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Unk","length":182,"content":{"description":"\nIt was one of those days….wet in the morning but drying by noon.  What to do?  Helmut and Ron took off about 11am with a more optimistic view of the weather than we had.  But damm it, he was right, so off M-J and I went off an hour later.\n\nThe face was pretty broken up….Class “2+ /3 “.  Mostly solid rock under foot….ledges then up a short corner…repeat…repeat.  Looked like a zillion different ways you might go, BUT, then on the other side of a boulder on a ledge, a footprint in the sand from the “earlier” party.
