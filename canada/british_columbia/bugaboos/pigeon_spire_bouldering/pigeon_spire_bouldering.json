This pushes the definition of a climbing route, but merits inclusion because of its sheer quality - this toilet is not to be missed if you're in the area climbing the West Ridge and the weather is good.\n\nAccess as for West Ridge, but instead of ascending the ridge, follow the sign for the toilet. A few meters after the sign, stay low and to the left to avoid accidentally approaching from above.\nThe route is rated A0 because you use fixed gear (a wooden platform) to access the summit. The alternative, an unprotected dyno to the seat, is not recommended."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"TRSJq2g9XvCpi/EmRSvX0w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.785,50.7189]}},"createdBy":"3nuUvgj+Xs+CwitAmlhvDg==","_change":{"user":"3nuUvgj+Xs+CwitAmlhvDg==","historyId":"6413faaaf0cf0083295e7659","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:14.529Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,26913742-ffc5-5c8f-834b-7f0cd1b58d81,4d1489ab-683d-5ef0-a98b-f126452bd7d3","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Bugaboos","Pigeon Spire (Bouldering)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.785,50.7189]},"bbox":[-116.78571022274343,50.71845033981814,-116.78428977725655,50.71934966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"TRSJq2g9XvCpi/EmRSvX0w=="},"content":{"description":"See Pigeon Spire."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413faaaf0cf0083295e7659","prevHistoryId":"6413faa9f0cf0083295e7653","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:13.119Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:50.195Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
