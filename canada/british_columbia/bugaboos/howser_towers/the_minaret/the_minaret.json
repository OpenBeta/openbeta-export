It Starts on Bad Hair then when Bad Hair goes way right you do the nice middle pitches through the roofs straight up the Italian Pillar. Then We got sorta lost at the last section of roofs way up. We tried to keep on Bad Italian Hair but we got lured quite a ways left due to big chopper blocks in the roofs.  \n  \n One pendulum kept this from being an all free ascent but I think it would go totally free with a bolt or a bigger pair of balls. Anyway it's a fun route on pretty good rock for the most part until you get near the top pitches which are sorta licheny and has some loose flake madness.\n\nStart on Bad Hair Day. When you get to where this route goes right stay on the Italian Pillar going straight at the beautiful roof with perfect splitter hand cracks on the right side of corner. Climb through first roof then eventually step out right to a bolted belay. We linked both the roofs you will see and belayed off natural pro in the wide crack but was a mistake and didn't see the stance below us till after.  <br />  <br /> Follow a crack/flake system to a belay below a huge roof system that hosts too many cracks to choose from. We took the far left corner through the roofs where we found an ancient fixed stopper with white 7 mil rope through it. Climb through this roof (crux) and sketch your way up on the tiny flake system to where it blanks out. Stand by for terrifying or penjy out left to a nice corner with a hand crack in it. <br />  <br /> From here it goes straight up climbing nice corners and some not so nice ptiches which consist of a lot of expando action. At least one of the anchors we had was built in all expando. Do your best. Navigate your way to the top of the Minaret via good cracks for the most part except for some lichen. <br />  <br /> To get down either continue to the top of the South Howser and rap the Beckey-Chouinard rappels or rap Doubting the Millenium. We chose the latter due to a huge cornice that menaced the rappels of the BC route. Rapping Doubting the Millenium is no joke. The guide book makes it sound casual but it isn't. We had to dump a full set of stoppers and a grip of slings up there. I guess for you it's all set up now though. Plus stuck ropes on A3 pitches was common and stressful without a hammer and pin rack. Great position on the Minaret none the less!\nDouble set of camalots from .5 through 4. Full set of Aliens and a few offset Aliens are nice. Nice set of Stoppers. Lots of Slings.

The first was in 2006, when we climbed it in a day with about 40 meters of aid. We tried to free it a few days later but it didn't work out. We returned in 2013 and were turned back multiple times due to rain, snow and generally unstable weather. \n\nFinally, in 2015, we returned for 3 weeks. Our 6th time on the route that trip we both freed it, with Bruce putting in quite a few big efforts over several hours to get the first 5.12c pitch clean. \n\nWe continued to the top of South Howser Tower in the dark (not easy!), bumbled around trying to find the \"new\" rap route without success, and eventually just rapped via the old north face raps. By the time we reached the glacier it was daylight once again. \n\nApproach: Ascend snow to the first weakness left (about 15 meters) of the major gash splitting the southwest face of the Minaret. Depending on the snow level you can either step across the gap to access a comfortable, sloping ledge to rope up, or climb several meters up to the ledge from a crack on the right. \n\nThe route:\n\np1: 5.9 (62m) From the right side of the ledge climb a wide crack and continue upward, first staying right, then left to bypass a small roof in a wide chimney. As the angle eases, veer rightward to a large, blocky ledge system and belay on its right side. \n\np2: 5.9 (62m) Step down and right from the belay, into the gash and up about 15 meters. Climb the right wall of the gash via powerful moves at an undercling crack with juggy sidepulls. Continue upward on lower-angled cracks to a comfortable ledge with two fixed nuts. \n\np3: 5.8 (40m) Climb upward through a slot followed by moderate cracks. Belay at a slung pillar where the wall steepens (often wet). \n\np4: 5.11- (65m) “The Youth Team Eliminator” Struggle upward through steep, flared cracks and small roofs, encountering several cruxes. Continue all the way to a big ledge beneath a right-facing corner with two bolts. \n\np5: 5.10+ (35m) Stem up the beautiful corner to a small stance with a bolt and fixed pin. Sustained.\n\np6: 5.11 (35m) Continue up the steepening corner past a chimney to a stance with two bolts. \n\np7: 5.12+ (32m) “The Murder of the Impussible” Ascend the corner for 20 meters, then step right and climb a large flake for 5 meters to its top. Traverse rightward past two bolts on very thin holds to a crack and a bolted, hanging belay. \n\np8: 5.12+ (20m) Climb straight up the seam past a bolt and two pins. Pass a roof on its right and work up to a stance on a small, loose flake. \n\np9: 5.10+ (32m) Steep, hollow flakes and cracks lead to a belay beneath a giant, right-facing corner. \n\np10: 5.9 (55m) Climb to the top of the corner via flared cracks and belay at a semi-hanging stance. \n\np11: 5.7 (60m) Move up and left on easier terrain, wandering up the path of least resistance, to a large, flat ledge. \n\np12: 5.7 (70m) From the right side of the ledge climb a chimney and lower-angled cracks up and slightly left. \n\np13: 5.4 (20m) Romp up fun, featured rock to the summit of the Minaret. \n\nSome parties may want to rappel from here. If so, I’ve heard it can be relatively straightforward, though I don’t personally know the best way (Bruce and I continued to the summit of South Howser Tower both times we topped out the Minaret). \n\nTo continue to the top of South Howser Tower:\n\np14-20: 5.9\n\nFrom the top of the Minaret, walk north down a “sidewalk” toward the East Ridge of South Howser Tower. Ascend a steep gully (straightforward if snow-filled, horribly loose if not -- the FA party climbed it in both conditions) to the ridge crest. Climb to the summit of South Howser Tower via the East Ridge in seven long pitches. \n\nDescent: Use the standard South Howser Tower rappel route to the glacier beneath the north face of the Howser Massif. Cross the glacier to the Pigeon-Howser Col and descend to the East Creek Basin.\n\n\n\nThis route is on the west face of the Minaret, and had been attempted several times previously.\n\nFrom camp in the East Creek Basin head straight up to the left side of the wall (~15 minutes).\n\n1ea: RPs, #00 Metolius - #.3 Camalot (offset cams useful), #3 and #4 Camalots <br /> 2ea: #.4 Camalot - #2 Camalot, medium nuts"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"IBX8kJYoWze+UoJ9GfTaCQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.82624,50.73834]}},"createdBy":"fbqDohqsUemDAIB1E/MYwA==","_change":{"user":"fbqDohqsUemDAIB1E/MYwA==","historyId":"6413fa94f0cf0083295e7551","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:28:52.056Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,26913742-ffc5-5c8f-834b-7f0cd1b58d81,9b4426fb-e781-51a6-92c2-6945bff9ff49,2015fc90-9628-5b37-be52-827d19f4da09","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Bugaboos","Howser Towers","The Minaret"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.82624,50.73834]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"IBX8kJYoWze+UoJ9GfTaCQ=="},"content":{"description":"The Minaret is one of the most impressive granite towers in the world. It looks sorta like a silo of granite around 2,200 feet tall that just rises out of the glacier in front of the South Howser. It screams climb me. There are about six routes on this tower which were all aid until 2002 when Heidi Wirtz and Lizzy Scully bagged the first free ascent with their route Bad Hair Day (ED1 5.12-).\n\nAfter this Renan Ozturk, Nick Martino, and Cedar Wright freed the Italian Pillar (ED1 5.12?) and also the FFA of the beautiful South West Pillar (ED1 5.12.+?). The Minaret is about 5 minutes uphill from the East Creek Bivy which is one of the most gorgeous zones in the range. Being able to bivy here is a dream. But we were really upset with the amount of human waste we found. If you are going to camp here pack out your shit.\n\nThere was a shit pit that was left down glacier that ran right into a perfect glacial lake which is now polluted due to peoples carelessness. We also found a five gallon bucket of shit that had a crack in the lid which would surely spill out into the glacier in winter. We built a laboratory that accepts WAG BAGS just right a couple hundred feet West of the first bivy sights at the Creek.
