It's 2000' tall and has pitch after pitch of 5.8 and 5.9 climbing with short sections of 5.10 thrown in here and there for good measure. The elegant line follows a large buttress that soars up the full height of the west face. This is a full value route with excellent climbing, great position and spectacular views. Not to be missed.\n\nP1: From a slab on the right side of the ridge climb up cracks and flakes to the ridge crest and belay. (5.5)\n\nP2: Continue up the ridge crest and belay. (5.5)\n\nP3: Keep climbing the crest until it steepens then follow cracks and grooves to the left of the crest to a belay ledge. (5.7)\n\nP4: Climb just to the right of the crest following a finger and hand crack through a small bulge (5.10-) continue up to a small ledge and belay.\n\nP5: Follow cracks just to the left of the ridge to easy ground. Continue up a flake and chimney to the left of the crest and belay on a sloping ledge. (5.8)\n\nP6: Traverse right on an handrail to a large left facing dihedral. Climb up the dihedral and belay in a little alcove behind a jagged block. (5.8)\n\nP7: Continue up the dihedral to a crack that leads to a large ledge covered with scree. (5.8)\n\nP8: Climb up the scree ledge to its upper end and belay at a bivy site.\n\nP9: Climb a chimney and follow cracks through blocks, belay near the bottom of a steep wall. (5.6)\n\nP10: To the left follow a short but difficult crack to a ledge, traverse right to some opposing dihedrals and climb the right dihedral to a large flat ledge. (5.8)\n\nP11: This is the start of the upper headwall pitches, referred to as the Great White Headwall. On the left side of the ledge climb a strenuous hand and fist crack up a right facing corner to a ledge. Continue up a another crack in a left facing corner till you are able to climb out left onto a steep face to a belay ledge out left. (5.10)\n\nP12: Climb up above the belay and make a balance move right into a corner. Follow the corner past some blocks and a squeeze that's hard but can be done with a pack on. Belay at the base of a gully. (5.10)\n\nP13: Climb up the gully to where it steepens turning into a corner. Follow the second crack on the left wall and belay at the bottom of a right facing corner. (5.9)\n\nP14: Follow the long right facing dihedral to a two pin anchor in a small notch. (5.8)\n\nP15: This is the crux pitch which can be aided but I didn't think it felt to hard. Traverse out left on thin holds and make a difficult move around the arete. Continue up an easy gully to its top and belay. The traverse can also be tensioned at A0. (5.10 or A0)\n\nFrom the top of the Gully make one rappel off a nest of slings and follow fourth and easy fifth class terrain to the true summit. To descend find the first rap anchor to the east of the summit and make 6 double rope rappels to the glacier. There are numerous rap anchors on the east face so keep an eye out and make sure your ropes reach to the glacier below the bergshrund on the last rap before you commit to it. Some parties put in a V-thread because their ropes didn't reach.\n\nTo get to this route take the Pigeon-Howser Col to the East Creek Basin Bivy.  From the bivy head north following the occasional cairn and scramble up right onto the ridge.  Work your way up the ridge until a large split boulder blocks your path.\nA standard rack of nuts and cams up to 4\" with some extra 1.5\" to 2\" pieces."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ZYTC7GdJW6azeBXHJs5T6Q==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.8086,50.7273]}},"createdBy":"Fbp7NvD0VWOgK1u8LtaTQw==","_change":{"user":"Fbp7NvD0VWOgK1u8LtaTQw==","historyId":"6413fa9cf0cf0083295e75c3","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:00.858Z"},{"_id":"NMmIchtBQViAJhIoshra1A==","name":"The Big Hose, South Howser Tower","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Jon Krakaur, 1978","length":212,"content":{"description":"HISTORY \n  \n Jon Krakauer soloed this super-direct ice gully on his way up to do the first solo ascent of the Devils Thumb in Alaska.  First done in May, but I've heard reports of later ascents. \n  \n APPROACH \n  \n Hike in via Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col and the Vowell Neve.  Use the map in the photos section below to help with planning.  \n  \n ROUTE DESCRIPTION \n  \n The first pitch crosses the 'schrund. About five more to the summit. A couple of eighty-degree bulges on the lower pitches lead to a chockstone/vertical pillar crux.  Check out the marked photo.  \n  \n DESCENT \n  \n On an early season ascent, be ready to descend the hose with V-threads, etc.  It may be very hard to find the summer rappels under the ice. \n  \n EQUIPMENT \n  \n Thermometer because long northern days cause dangerously warm nights.  Bring all the gear for ice, some roch gear too.  You might get past the bergschrund rappelling with a single 70 meter rope.  But that can change.   \n  \n MOUNTAIN AND ROAD CONDITIONS \n  \n The road in should be open by some time in May.  Road conditions do get reported sometimes by the Association of Canadian Mountain Guides .   \n  \n It is possible to stay in the hut before the wardens are on duty for the summer.  Neither heat nor water in the sinks, but the propane lights and stoves can be turned on.  Contact BC Parks for an update.   \n  \n Chic Scott did the second traverse of the Bugaboos to Roger's Pass ski mountaineering route.  He has this to say in his outstanding book Ice Fields and Summits, 1994:   \n  \n \"The road is normally plowed for 17 km.  From there it is another 25 km on skis or by snowmobile to the CMH Bugaboo Lodge.  A ski ascent of 700 vertical meters and 5 km up the Bugaboo Glacier takes you to Conrad Kain Hut.\" \n  \n \"A very good run (on April/May snowpack) can be had down the Bugaboo Glacier, starting along the left side of the glacier and finishing on the right side into the valley.\" \n  \n Too much information?  Not if you want to find that window of opportunity when it might be possible to combine an ice route with a ski descent."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ZYTC7GdJW6azeBXHJs5T6Q==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.8086,50.7273]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6413fa9df0cf0083295e75cd","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:01.442Z"},{"_id":"+AAYB7GAR5yjOy+++T0MCA==","name":"East Shoulder-East Face","grades":{"yds":"5.8"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Helmey Beckey,  Loyd  Anderson, Lyman Boyer, Tom  Campbell, 1941","length":303,"content":{"description":"This is the original way to climb the hardest and second highest summit in the Bugaboo Group.  Beautiful, steep, mountains attract talent, and the last unclimbed summit in the Bugaboos didn't stay that way for long. \n  \n Before World War II, Loyd Anderson was well known; for his tenacity against the weather, the recent first ascent of Forbidden Peak (with the young Beckey brothers), and later for founding REI.  Helmy Beckey, only 16, made the second ascent of Mount Waddington the next year (with his brother Fred).  \n  \n Loyd and his team of \"young recruits\" found out a Sierra Club team was also after the big prize.  They said little of their intentions at Boulder Camp.  The next morning as the sierrans started up, the north cascades team was well on their way to the summit. (Climbing in North America, Chris Jones, 1976)    \n  \n Harder than Snowpatch Spire?  In 1990, Bugaboo Rock still rated the origninal South Howser route, IV, 5.6, A1.  Snowpatch is rated IV, 5.6+.  Teton climber, Bill Buckingham, found a way to free it in 1961, 5.8, and thought the crux about equal to Wiessner's Route.  Even after pioneering the difficult East Ridge Integral in 1970, Michael Heath and Bill Sumner still reported using some aid on the way to the summit.  \n  \n This climb also requires real alpine ice climbing, at least that is what we found in 1980.  Photos by Mountain Project contributors seem to indicate this route is wasting away, like so many others.    \n  \n ROUTE DESCRIPTION \n  \n Climb over Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col, head up to the Pigeon-South Howser Col, and turn right to follow easy, but crevassed, snow to the base of the ice face on the South Shoulder.  \n  \n The first pitch passes the schrund and belays by the rock above.  should be rappel anchors because this used to be a more popular way down.  Climb two more long pitches of fun 45-50 degree ice up to the top of the Southeast Shoulder.  From the north end of the flat ridge-top, there is supposed to be a ledge to follow out right on the East Face. Pass a snow-patch and climb a chimney (5.8/C1 crux.  Above the hard part, three pitches of 5.6 lead to the summit. \n  \n DESCENT \n  \n Six, double rope, rappels straight down the East Face.   \n  \n EQUIPMENT \n  \n Bring two axes/tools, real boots, crampons, and a rack of screws for the first three pitches.  A rock rack and rock shoes too. Two ropes for the last rappel past the 'schrund are recommended.
