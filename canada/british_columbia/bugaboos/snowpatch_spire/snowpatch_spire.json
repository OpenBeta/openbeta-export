Start in a short (5.11-) splitter finger-crack off the glacier and follow this up to the right side of a small overlap. Pull around the overlap (5.11) in a small layback wide section and continue up the very shallow right facing crack, until you can step over to the left-hand crack and follow this up to the bolted belay (5.11).\n\nPitch 2) 30m 5.12- Start up the crack right of the belay (piton) and use the crack and face moves on the left to gain the right side of the first small overhang. Follow the hand crack in the right facing corner on the right side of this overhang until you can you reach the roof. Climb left over the roof and up a slightly right trending crack (pitons) up to the steep finger crack crux. The last 4m is the crux (fingers) and can easily be aided at C1. Bolted belay\n\nPitch 3) 60m 5.10 Follow the long corner above, a bolted belay is found at 60m, but it is possible to break this pitch into two shorter pitches at one of the many good belay stances and old pitons.\n\nPitch 4) 45m 5.11- Follow the awesome enduro corner until on top of the “Elephant truck” pillar. New Bolted belay (one old 1/4 bolt found here)\n\nPitch 5) 60m 5.10+. Step left from the belay and climb up to an Aluminum self-drive (15years old??) then climb up and right on thin cracks and face climbing until you can gain a right trending ramp. At the top of the ramp, place gear in the crack, but face climbs up and left at first, but then back right to the crack 5m above. It is possible (maybe even recommended) to belay here or under the big roof a few meters ahead, although the FFA continued up the left facing corner for another 30m until they could break through the roof (only 5.9!!) and belay on the terrible hanging slab stance above the roof.\n\nPitch 6) 30-40m, 5.8.  instead of continuing straight up the dirty left facing corner, traverse straight right on the face crack until you can access the fine looking and clean 5.8 hands and fists crack that exits the main left facing corner. Climb this nice crack (old 1/4 bolt) until you can move straight up the face on good ledges and cracks. Many belay options/ledges\n\nPitch 7) 60m 5.9, (it is recommended to break this pitch into 2X30m pitches) A bit of a dubious pitch. Leave the belay and head up left aiming for a small overlap (5.8) that puts you onto of a small pillar 30m from the belay (likely it is best to belay here to ease the rope drag) from here work your way (any-way) across, up and left to an alcove belay at 60m and directly above the cracks that come from the slab belay above pitch 5. route finding can be a bit dubious. (old wood blocks and old pins throughout this pitch)\n\nPitch 8) 50m 5.8 head up the left-hand crack until it switches to a shallow low angle left facing crack. a nice anchor can be made on a ledge just above an old 1/4 bolt.\n\nPitch 9) 60m 5.8 Head up and left through several left facing underling corners, then continue straight up until a stance under a large black overhanging right facing corner/overhang. When below this feature, head up and right on nice face cracks to a left facing short off-width. At the top of the off-width step left on to loose ground and belay on top of a ledge/tower. (top of the Becky chimney that comes in from the left???)\n\nPitch 9) 60m 5.7. Continue up and left through several ledges and corners\n\nPitch 10) 50m 5.7 Continue up until you reach and left the trending ramp. Belay at the top of the ramp.\n\nPitch 11) 50m 5.7 Join the Honeymoon variation from the snow patch route. Head up through small off-widths and ramps until you reach a small roof, head out left on ramps and up to the ridge crest.\n\nhttp://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13201214529/Snowpatch-Spire-Beckey-Mather-Route-First-Free-Ascent\n\nThe route starts at the far left (southern) side of the East face of Snowpatch Spire.

Originally rated 5.8, don't believe it.  It was a test-piece back in the day. \n  \n APPROACH ROUTES \n  \n There is a map in the photo gallery for Kraus-McCarthy approach beta.  The standard approach is via Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col.  \n  \n If a summer like 2009 happens again, then both climbing and rappelling the Pigeon-Snowpatch Rappels might be a new way to approach the West Face routes.  I have not yet found a report of this being done but did see a trip report that estimated a difficulty of 5.6.  \n  \n Go here for both current and historical condition reports by Canadian guides:   acmg.ca/mcr/archives.asp     \n    \n DESCENT  \n  \n Most climbers experience this route vicariously, from rappel. Kraus-McCarthy is the standard way down for most parties after climbing the Weisser/Southeast Corner route.  Teams ascending Kraus-McCarthy can expect to be outnumbered by those descending.  Morning shade is a drag on alpine rock, but this route is worth it.     \n  \n Since I last did this route, bolt &amp; chain rappel anchors have been installed at thirty meter intervals. Four 60 meter rappels or eight 30 meter rappels. Since there are plenty of safe bolt stations, it will be much easier to work with others on the route. \n\n<b>ROUTE DESCRIPTION</b>  <br />    <br /> The first hard pitch starts following a ramp left up to a 5.8 roof.   <br />  <br /> The second hard pitch follows ramp-like feature back right, past a lone bolt rap anchor.  It is possible to belay here, on the right side of the gully, before the line moves back left.   <br />  <br /> Or try to stretch this pitch up left on sloping 5.7 ends at a belay in a left facing and leaning corner.   <br />  <br /> The next pitch is a rounded 5.8 lieback.  sometime verglass or wetness can make getting to the 5.8 more serious.  Small ledge to belay.   <br />  <br /> The next pitch starts rightward and ends after a traverse left, easier than 5.8 if dry.  The belay should be a small stance with bolt anchors. <br />  <br /> Seems like the last 20 feet the the main crack are by far the crux, 5.9+ at least. This is where I'd like to try a big cam (#6).  There is a dodge right, to a thin crack at least 5.10.  Harder, and not great for the second. <br />  <br /> <b>DESCENT</b> <br />  <br /> Most climbers experience this route vicariously, from rappel.

Before weighting the very directional and portable anchor, climbers would have to squeeze down into the chimney. Once under the sketchy flake and on rappel, the security of the chimney was replaced with 240 meters of exposure. The next anchor was a tied off pancake flake, somehow wedged between the walls of a 90 degree corner, even more uncertain than the summit anchor."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"SDELwQFGWvC3kUE9Bf2y/A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.78162,50.73667]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6413fab1f0cf0083295e76b0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:21.444Z"},{"_id":"24U8mQyaRHOVu61Sx4ei1w==","name":"Minotaur Direct","grades":{"yds":"5.11+"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Jon Walsh, Colin Moorhead, and Michelle Kadatz 2016","length":545,"content":{"description":"This route is a direct (and easier) version of Minotaur and follows a number of old aid lines as well as new terrain including the 1st 4 pitches through the large rock scar. Fully bolted belays and easy to rappel, this is a nice sustained adventure up the east face of snow patch. It needs more gardening/scrubbing to reach its full potential, and for a party that has the time fully excavating the cracks on the upper pitches and scrubbing off some of the lichen could make this as clean as Sunshine Crack! Full story of the first ascent and good beta found here:  alpinestyle.ca/locations/bu…. \n  \n P1 and P2: Start off the snow at the base of the wall on the left side of the obvious scoop in the rock scar. Climb up hand cracks (5.10-), cross the scoop (possible gear belay) then continue up the slabby but thinner corner (5.10+) to a two bolt anchor. This can be climbed in 1 pitch with a 70m (60m may work early season). Difficulty and length dependent on the amount of snow at the base. \n  \n P3 5.10+, 30m: Climb the corner above and pull through a small overhang. Step left and up a shallow left facing corner, until an easy ramp leads to flakes back right. Hand traverse these until you reach a two bolt belay. \n  \n P4 5.11+, 35m: Great long pitch with three distinct crux sections. Pull through a thin section of tips down low that changes into a stem corner, at the top of this corner move left clipping a bolt and pulling face moves onto the arete out left, then cut back right into the corner. A few very thin stemming/ chimney moves (small gear) bring you up to another two bolt anchor. \n  \n P5 5.10+, 50m: This is what you (maybe) brought the #5 for. Climb the steep fist crack off the belay and then layback over the bulge with the wide pod. Once you are established above this bulge, look up above you for the bolt, clip it and climb up and left into the right leaning corner above with a nice handcrack. Follow this easier climbing up and right until you reach the big ledge, then traverse this up and left to a two bolt anchor with rings, beneath a rightward trending groove. \n  \n These first five pitches are shared with Welcome to the Machine (a route that should definitely be added by someone who has climbed it). The Welcome to the Machine anchors are just to the left beneath the obvious flake. \n  \n P6, 5.10+, 30m: climb up into the groove, clip two knifeblades and then face climb up to a two bolt anchor. \n  \n P7, 5.11+, 35m: Climb the finger crack, traversing left and then back right into the main crack. Get some gear at the roof and then pull it. Mostly 5.10 fingers other than the roof pull. Anchor to the left on the slab above. \n  \n P8 5.11a, 30m: Climb up and clip the bolt, then traverse the slab to the right, until reaching the base of the left leaning, left facing corner. Head up this (micro cams and rps) until reaching two pins. Climb up into the main corner (another pin and 2 bolts followed by gear) and continue up to a bolted belay. \n  \n P9 5.10, 55m Look up and right to the steeper, left facing wall with a number of good looking cracks, you are headed to the base of this. Mostly easy climbing with a short finger crack crux. Climb up the corner until just below the grassy ledge. Step right and traverse up on ledgy terrain until reaching a two bolt anchor. This is a nice bivy ledge for those who might want more time to do the route. \n  \n P10 5.9, 20m: Climb up the best of the cracks, belay station on the left but easy to link with the next pitch. \n  \n P11 5.11a, 30m: Climb the right crack on good hands until it slims down to a thin finish into the alcove and a bolted belay. \n  \n P12 5.10+, 35m: Climb up the crack on the left for 5m and then make a reachy moves with some face features to the crack on the right that parallels the arete. Follow this crack up over the lip to a bolted belay. This pitch might feel harder and could use a good scrubbing. \n  \n P13 5.9, 30m, Climb the chimney (easy but runout) to the top of the pinnacle. Can link this with P12 with a 70m. \n  \n P14 5.11c, 30m: Pull bouldery moves in the thin left slanting crack off the belay, passing 3 bolts. The crack then eases in difficulty and takes you up to a nice belay ledge. \n  \n P15 5.11, 30m: This is the pitch that made me want to do this climb. Follow a fist crack up the left side of the pillar, then look up in awe at the splitter thin hands crack through the headwall above. Rest up then punch it up thin jams. You could place 3x #0.75 or #1 camalots on this pitch, but for the strong crack climber a double rack from #0.5 to #1 would be adequate. \n  \n P16 5.10, continue up the crack as the angle kicks back and it gradually widens. Step right around the bulge and continue up a groove to a bolted belay. \n  \n You could scramble up to the summit (4th class?) or just start rapping the route. 2x 60m required to rap. Not all bolted anchors have rings/quicklinks so pay attention on the way up to figure out which to skip. From the top of P4 a 60m rap will take you to the top of P2, then one more rap back to the snow (note that this won't be where you started, so think about where to leave the packs, we threw ours down onto the glacier to make them easier to get back to).\n\nLocate the obvious scoop in the rock scar on the East Face.

After the highest attempt yet, Wiessner is famous for saying it would be:  \"...merely an affair of driving iron in the virgin rock!\"  (The 2010 movie, North Face, about the Eiger in 1936, is accurate for the rack and other gear of the day).  But the story twists, Bedayn and Arnold found the upper headwall to be well within Wiessner's ability. (Climbing in North America, Chris Jones, 1976)    \n       \n NOMENCLATURE \n  \n This route goes by three names; Snowpatch Route, Southeast Corner, and Wiessner's Route. The current guidebook, Bugaboo Rock, left one name out. \n  \n During the 1970's, I often would hear climbers proudly say:  \"We did Wiessner's!\".  The guidebook used in the 1970's gave the route no name at all (Bill Putnam, 1971).  Climbing in North America states that the successful team \"quickly concluded that Wiessner's route offered the best chance for success\" (Jones, 1976).  So the route was named before it was climbed.   \n  \n RATING \n  \n Bill Putnam's 1971 AAC guide gives the route 5.6.  The next book published, Bugaboo Rock rates it 5.6+.  I've met people on the summit who thought the Vein was a sandbag.   \n  \n APPROACH  \n  \n There is an approach map in the photo gallery below.  Hike the trail from the hut up to the Pigeon Fork of the Bugaboo Glacier.  Once past the steep rock of the southeast spur of Snowpatch, snow leads up to the col in the southeast spur where the roped climbing starts.  \n  \n The Association of Canadian Mountain Guides has a forum for guides to report current conditions in both the Canadian Rockies and Columbia Mountains:   acmg.ca/mcr/archives.asp   \n  \n ROUTE DESCRIPTION \n  \n The climb can be separated into three sections; the initial five pitches up to the Wiessner Overhang Traverse, the six pitches up the left side of the snowpatch that is the mountain's namesake, and the final three crux pitches up the summit headwall. \n  \n From the notch, a couple of easy pitches lead to a large corner, the first 5.4 bit.  The corner faces left, away from the hut and the low angle left wall is climbed.  Next, a 5.4 spur is followed to a stance below the Wiessner Overhang, which is not climbed directly.  Move right to the 5.5 hand traverse used by Wiessner to dodge the roof and gain the easy slabs next to the snowpatch. The start of this bit is shown with orange dots on Kevin Crag's shot of the south face.  \n  \n Several easy pitches parallel the left side of the snowpatch, then move climbers right (north) a couple hundred feet, eventually passing a large detached flake.  The 5.9 Direct heads left from this flake. \n  \n The first pitch up the headwall is a 5.4 chimney followed by a hand traverse left to a belay below the Vein Pitch.  \n  \n (The Vein is actually an aplite dike.  Miners call dikes veins and aplitic means the crystals in the dike are smaller than in the surrounding granite, relatively fine grained. The famous Snake Dike, 5.7, on Half Dome is a famous example of aplite dike climbing.) \n  \n For the Vein Pitch there is a choice: either a 5.6 offwidth or the fine climbing on the vein, rated up to 5.8. There is consensus that the route is not done unless you do the Vein.  After the crux, hopefully still protected with good fixed pins (in once-virgin granite), move left to rejoin with the offwidth line and stretch the pitch to a belay on flakes. \n  \n An account of both cruxes, the Vein and subsequent traverse, by Jack Arnold is found at the bottom of this page.  \n  \n The third and final summit headwall pitch starts by climbing up to a leftwards traverse. The traverse leads to a zig-zag crack, 5.6.  The pitch ends with a 5.4 ramp crawl right to the belay spot.  One final easy lead to the top. \n  \n DESCENTS:   \n  \n There are three ways to get down; Wiessner's, Kraus-McCarthy to Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col, and Kraus-McCarthy to the Pigeon-Snowpatch Rappels.  Photos and a map can be found in the photo gallery below.   \n  \n 1.  The original descent was to reverse Weissner's route.  This is what the American Alpine Club Climbers Guide to the Interior Ranges of British Columbia recommended:  \"On descent, one long (150') rappel from below the summit ridge will reach the chimney (on Wiessner's).\" (William L Putnam, 1971)  By 1974, most parties were rappelling the West Face, but not everyone. \n  \n 2.  The most popular and best way off the South Summit of Snowpatch Spire is to descend the backside (west).  \n  \n First, rappel the Kraus-McCarthy route.  There are bolt anchors every 30 meters; Either four 60 meter rappels or eight 30 meter rappels.  The 30 meter way can be stretchy. \n  \n Second, walk north to Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col and descend via rappels or down-climbing the 40 degree snow or ice. There is more than one bolted route down the \"couloir\".  Should be a small sign to help find the anchors. The last rappel often requires two ropes to get past the bergschrund.    Summer of 2009, extreme melting made the col too dangerous to use and a new way started to get used. \n  \n Col rap anchor photo:   mountainproject.com/v/inter… \n  \n 3.  The Pigeon-Snowpatch Rappels are now an alternative to the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col.  Unlike the col, this way does not get climbed.  If your staying at Applebee, then this way home is much longer than the col. \n  \n First Rappel the Kraus-McCarthy.   \n  \n Next head south on snow, staying close to the rock of the Snowpatch's lower Southwest Ridge.  A large cairn on the rock marks the anchors.  One guide's report mentions having to cross 25 degree bare ice to get to the anchors.  His party got across late day without crampons but he didn't think it would have been doable, sans crampons, when really frozen. \n  \n Several 30 meter rappels on rock, close to an icefall, end on the Bugaboo Glacier.   \n  \n Rope up for the hike down the glacier, notorious for crevasse hazard.  Some have avoided late season crevasse hazard by side-hilling on the unstable moraines instead.  They admitted to a preference for rockfall hazard instead of deep icy holes. \n  \n Finally, rejoin the approach hike to return to the Hut. \n        \n EQUIPMENT \n  \n My guess for your rack is to bring a wide range on the rack, but not too many doubles.  Lots of slings too.  This route has been done a lot with a small rack.    \n  \n KRAUS-McCARTHY ORIGINAL RAPPEL ANCHORS \n      \n The old summit anchor was a 20 kilogram flake, about 80 centimeters in length, tied off and laid across the top of the Kraus-McCarthy chimney, where it splits the flat summit ledge.  Before weighting the very directional and portable anchor, climbers would have to squeeze down into the chimney.  Once under the sketchy flake and on rappel, the security of the chimney was replaced with 240 meters of exposure.  The next anchor was a tied off pancake flake, somehow wedged between the walls of a 90 degree corner.   \n  \n Thanks for the anchors! \n  \n MORE BETA FROM THE PAST \n  \n Jack Arnold's description of the crux:   \n  \n \"On a very smooth, vertical face and, running upwards across the face at a seventy degree tangent, was a quartz vein with small knobs protruding.  None of these knobs extended more than an inch and most of them considerably less. Raffi, placing pitons in the vein, led up on these small knobs, to where he was stopped by a large overhang. This necessitated a traverse left on, purely on the arms, to the base of a large chock-stone where this pitch ends.  On following, I found balance on these knobs very critical and the arm traverse so difficult, due to the character of the sloping hold, that the only way I could get adequate purchase was to balance with my right fore-arm and, with the left hand helping, inch my way across.  The entire pitch is done under extreme exposure and I dare say the next party will find it interesting indeed.\" \n  \n (The Mountains of Canada, Randy Morse, 1978)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"SDELwQFGWvC3kUE9Bf2y/A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.78162,50.73667]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6413fab3f0cf0083295e76ce","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:23.957Z"},{"_id":"1sIB/ONFT0+zeL0sJEYnww==","name":"Southwest Ridge - Direct Finish","grades":{"yds":"5.8+"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Ted Davies & Pat Derouin,  August, 1971","length":212,"content":{"description":"INTRODUCTION \n  \n Ted Davies and Pat Derouin may have found the one of the easiest and shortest fifth class routes to the summit of Snowpatch Spire. Davies, Derouin, and their friends reported often in the Canadian Alpine Journal during the early 1970's.  Their articles had some of the best pictures and information available for the Bugaboos, Vowells, Sir Sandford, The Adamants, Blackfriar, even the Remillard Group.   \n   \n APPROACH  \n  \n Climbing begins with roping up for both the Snowpatch Glacier crossing and ascent to Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col.  From the col, follow easy neve all the way to the southern end of the west face.  Finally, scramble up to the start of the route.    \n  \n Summer of 2009, Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col became too dangerous to use.  If that ever happens again, then getting to the West Side of Snowpatch becomes extraordinarily difficult.  I would try climbing Pigeon, via the Bugaboo Glacier approach.  Afterward, do the Southwest Ridge Direct on the way to the Pigeon-Snowpatch rappels. \n  \n ROUTE       \n  \n The Southwest Ridge Direct and Surfs Up share the first three pitches.  Mountain Project contributor, Dr. Evil, posted a photo of the start on the Surfs Up page.  I added marks for this route and put a copy in the photo gallery below.   \n  \n Pitch One, 5.7, starts with low angle friction, climbs over fin/bulges, and ends on a ledge with a spike that can be slung for rappels. \n  \n Pitch two, 5.7, starts in a left facing and left leaning v-corner, followed by flared cracks, ending at a smaller stance with rap slings. \n  \n Pitch three, 5.8-, continues up the same cracks, then pulls a hand crack bulge, just before the belay alcove. This is where Surfs Up traverses right. \n  \n Pitch four, 5.easy, takes a left up the major weakness and ends on a blocky ledge.  \n  \n Pitch five, 5.8+, avoids the huge chimney of Killer Chipmunks over left.  Instead follow smaller, easier, corners and cracks. There is a crux roof blocking progress along the way. I'm pretty sure we ran the 50 meter rope out all the way to a ledge on the summit ridge.  You may notice that does not fit the Bugaboo Rock topo. There could be another belay along this stretch perhaps. \n  \n Pitch six, 4th class, follows the summit ridge to the top, staying mostly east of the crest. \n  \n From the rappel bolts, there still a short pitch of 3rd class to reach the true summit.  If the last summit slabs are snowcovered, then a tricky 5.5 can be done, staying west of the wetness.    \n  \n DESCENT \n  \n First, rappel Kraus-McCarthy using bolted and chained anchors.  Either four 60m rappels or eight 30 meter rappels.  Some of the 30m rappels are a close cut.  Then it might be necessary to get the rock shoes wet re through a bit of snow back to your approach shoes. \n  \n Second, There is a choice of either the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col or the Pigeon-Snowpatch Rappels.  Bugaboo-Snowpatch is much faster for returning to Applebee Meadows.\n\n<b>PROTECTION</b> <br />  <br /> A rack with a wide range is good. Smaller cams might help with sparse pro of the first pitch. Big cams too, at least up to #4.  I'm not afraid to bring my #5.  Lots of runners too. <br />  <br /> For the glacier travel, an axe, boots, crampons to leave at the base.  How much crevasse rescue gear you take is up to you. There is crevasse hazard on Snowpatch Glacier, The Vowell Neve, and Bugaboo Glacier."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"SDELwQFGWvC3kUE9Bf2y/A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.78162,50.73667]}},"createdBy":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","_change":{"user":"z+7whyi8WvKLQ21afITwQw==","historyId":"6413fab4f0cf0083295e76d8","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:24.554Z"},{"_id":"g1hD5koXQPOAg2806bYA9A==","name":"Sunshine Crack","grades":{"yds":"5.11-"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Alex Lowe, S Scott, July 1980","length":273,"content":{"description":"\nThis climb is one of the best I have ever done! It follows a continuous crack system for almost 900 feet and has everything from fingers to offwidth. The following description is as my partner and I climbed it which was in six long pitches with a 60m rope. Done this way we thought that every pitch was in the 5.10 range. Bring two ropes to rap off (we had a tag line) and some warm clothes since you'll be in the shade for most of the climb.\n\nP1: Climb up a steep right facing dihedral with two cracks and pull through a slight overhang on the left. Continue up an obvious crack bypassing the first anchor. The crack gradually widens to an offwidth as the wall gets steeper. Work your way up the solid 5.10 OW and pull onto lower angle rock to another anchor. I thought this pitch felt about 5.10c.\n\nP2: Continue up the crack for about 10' until you get to another crack that angles slightly up and right. Hand traverse right until the crack starts heading straight up again and follow it past an anchor into a perfect 2\" crack. Layback to the right off a wide crack and into a dihedral and belay at the anchor. (Note: I was about 5' short of the anchor so we had to simul-climb to reach it).\n\nP3: Continue up the dihedral till you get to another overhang. Power through a crack near the left side of the overhang and then traverse back right to gain another crack that continues up and belays about 20' below the crux roof. This pitch is probably hard 10.\n\nP4: The crux of this pitch and the whole climb is obvious. Climb up 20' until you're beneath a large corner roof. Plug a couple pieces at the lip and fire it, I didn't think this was too hard, just don't hang out or fiddle with gear until you're back on your feet. Climb past an anchor and up another overhanging bulge to a good belay stance.\n\nP5: Follow the cracks up and slightly right in a left facing dihedral from what I can recall. The crack will gradually go back left following a large flake until you get to a stance beneath a splitter wide-hands/fist crack.\n\nP6: This pitch is the icing on the cake. Jam the steep hand and fist crack for about 100' until the crack splits left and right. If you are spent you might want to consider going left at about 5.8 but it would be a shame to miss the crack heading right. Hand traverse right with great exposure and into a perfect hand crack that heads up and back left. As the crack comes to an end place one last piece and pull a few hard face moves to top out. This pitch is long but a 60m rope will just make it.\n\nAt this point you can rap back down the way you came up or jump onto one of the other routes nearby if you want to go to the summit.\n\n\nThis route is on the north side of Snowpatch Spire and not to hard to spot from the ground, just look for the offwidth.  Head up the Snowpatch-Bugaboo Col and traverse left about halfway up to a ledge covered with loose rock.  The start is almost directly below the offwidth/chimney that can be seen from the ledge and to the right of a large block dihedral.  To get down just rap the route, two ropes are probably needed.\nBring doubles from probably about .5\" to 3\" and at least one 3.5\", 4\" and 4.5\" (you might want two 4.5's for the OW).

Climb double cracks/flake for about 10 meters until you’re able trend-right, and easily up the big scoop. Make a gear anchor before it steepens where you can find some good foot ledges.p2 - 30 meters 5.10+; continue up the scoop via a thin corner crack, to a belay bolted belay a good stance.p3 - 30 meters 5.10+; climb the corner above and pull through a small overhang to a stance. Step left and head up a shallow left-facing corner, until an easy ramp leads back right. Follow this, hand traversing flakes until a bolted station below a long left-facing corner.p4 - 45 meters 5.11+; A thin tips corner gains a section of cool stemming. When you get to a bolt clip it and face climb left to the arete. Don’t move it up to the bolted station up and right or you’ll have to down-climb 3 meters to continue sending! from the stance on the arete, move up and right back into the left-facing corner, and follow past one more tips crux to the bolted station on a good ledge.p5 - 50 meters 5.10 ; After a couple of body lengths of fist crack, pull a small overhang. A #5 Camelot is useful here for the crux move. Rather than continue up the obvious corner, look up and you’ll see a bolt. Climb up to it, and move left into the next corner system which is much better. It leads to a fourth-class ledge, which needs to be traversed up and left. A bolt below a groove is the start of Minotaur. Continue past it for five more meters to a two bolt station bellow a nice-looking flake.p6 - 35 meters 5.10; Climb the flake up, then hand traverse it left. It turns into a walkable ledge. At its end, move up and left through small overlaps, then face climb left, and then back right to a bolted station.p7 - 45 meters 5.11+; This is the roof pitch of Deus Ex Machina. Move left off the belay, and then climb up a small right-facing corner on face holds. Move left into the main left corner and follow it through a series of small roofs to a bolted anchor.p8 - 60 meters 5.10; Climb the right-hand crack for five meters to a ledge, Move left into a corner which is wide but easy. Follow this to a good ledge. Continue up another short right-facing corner with a couple of tricky moves and make a gear belay another good ledge, with some very nice-looking corners up to the left. This pitch might be better to split into two as rope drag is a factor. Either way, a gear station needs to be made.p9 - 55 meters 5.11; An amazing pitch! Start by climbing double cracks, with a mix of gear and bolts for protection (3 protection bolts total). At a small stance there’s a fixed wire and a bolt for an optional belay, however, the FA team linked the next 30 meters of sustained 5.10 to a great ledge and bolted belay.p10 - 40m meters 5.11-; climb the nice finger crack up and right. After a section of fist crack, two bolts on your left traverse to a ledge system, and a two bolt anchor at the far left of it.p11 - 50 meters 5.10-; A clean corner above goes from hands to fists to off-width. After it gets too wide for a # 5 Camelot, two body lengths of easy lay-backing passes it and gets you to easier terrain with small gear options. Continue up the groove above to a two bolt station below some black overhangs.p.12 - 25 meters 5.11+; The last two pitches were nearly linked on the first ascent with 68m rope, but this is not recommended. Start by climbing through some overhangs with some great and unlikely moves. Belay at a good ledge.p.13 - 45 meters 5.11 ; Follow the crack up and left, until a big ledge is reached. This pitch is a bit dirty but will clean up with more ascents.\n\nDescent (modern descent is to rappel Minotaur Direct)\n\nOriginal Descent Description by Jon Walsh (August 04, 2015)\n\nA scramble for a couple of ropelengths up and left gets you to the North Summit.  You will pass the top station of Sendero Norte on the way which is probably the cleanest descent option.  Of course if you don't know it, it might be more difficult.\n\nThe other decent option is as follows:At the big ledge at the top of the last pitch, a sling around a pinch between boulders was used for the first rappel, to get back to the top of pitch 11.  From here, rappel to a nut station about 10 meters climbers right of the station at the top of pitch ten.  Careful of the rope eating crack below.  Best to just rappel to the top of pitch 9 from here to keep the rope out of the crack.  Then rappel to the obvious bivy ledge, on skiers left.  On the far side of this ledge, rappel down Minataur on bolted stations.  The first one is 55m.  The second one is 30 m and it’s best to clip a bolt on the way down as a directional.  Another 55m steep rappel gets you back to the big ledge at the top of pitch 5.  Continue down the pitches you’ve already climbed.  From the top of pitch 4, it's about a 65 meter rappel to the top of pitch 2, so if you have 60 meter ropes, it's best to place a directional or two to get into the optional station on pitch 4, and then rap to the top of pitch 2 from there.  One more 50-55 rappel puts you on the glacier. \n\n\n\nStart below the obvious large rock scar on the East face of Snowpatch, following the cresent shaped ramp/crack for the first two pitches. Step across the moat which gets harder as the season goes on \n\nRecommended rack: <br /> 2 x 60m ropes <br /> Double set of cams from tips to #3 camelot. <br /> Triple set from tight fingers to loose fingers (#.3, #.4, #.5 camelots) <br /> 1 #4 camelot, 1 #5 camelot <br /> One set of nuts <br /> 12-15 quick draws (half of them should be extendable)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"SDELwQFGWvC3kUE9Bf2y/A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.78162,50.73667]}},"createdBy":"ibtf+pXKVEO9flcuMSm70A==","_change":{"user":"ibtf+pXKVEO9flcuMSm70A==","historyId":"6413fab7f0cf0083295e7714","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:27.537Z"},{"_id":"8qybriMyRF2lUaWbiUjHjQ==","name":"Wildflowers","grades":{"yds":"5.9"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"B.
