Head left up cracks, and belay below a notch that leads to a ramp (5.4). 3. Go up the notch and mantle to get to the ramp (awkward). Follow the ramp and belay at its end (5.7). 4. Head up flakes toward the chimney and belay in an alcove (5.7). 5. Continue up the chimney and belay at the notch between the ears (5.7). 6.
