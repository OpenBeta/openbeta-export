Huge granite walls rise on all sides. The rock quality is generally very good and the possibilities for huge ascents of untouched walls is extensive. \n  \n There is a small (and very active) glacier at valley bottom, and seracs pose overhead hazard to certain walls/ gulleys. Shelter from the elements is limited. Bugs (especially noseeums) can be bad around the marshy areas to the NE.  Clean melt water can be easily found. Wildlife including bears and mountain goats is to be expected.  There are waterfalls and seepage streaks on certain walls, which likely freeze to form mega ice lines in the winter."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140aaff0cf0083295f2d5f","prevHistoryId":"64140aabf0cf0083295f2d44","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:37:29.430Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:16.425Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
