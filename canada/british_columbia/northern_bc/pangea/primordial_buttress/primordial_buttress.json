Involves a ton of fun and varied climbing through interesting terrain including dykes, splitter hand cracks, and face climbing over chicken heads and bizarre granite pods. There is 3-bolt ladder to get you through the hardest section, which could probably be freed at 11+ or 12-. Rock quality is very good, and mostly free of vegetation until the angle kicks back at around pitch 10. All anchors are bolted unless otherwise noted, but you may want to replace the rap webbing used at each.\n\nP1 - 5.10, 4 bolts, 40m. Climb a thin crack to a small roof less than 10m above. Pull through the roof and climb the slight corner to gain a dyke and two bolt anchor.\n\nP2 - 5.7, 5 bolts, 40m (gear belay). Climb the fun dyke, angling off to the right below a steeper section of wall. Belay at the base of a short left-facing dihedral.\n\nP3 - 5.10-, 4 bolts, 20m. Follow bolts face climbing left across bizarre undulating granite pods and chicken heads. A cruxy final move will bring you to an anchor just out of sight around the corner to the left\n\nP4 - 5.9, 4 bolts, 40m. Traverse right across the face from the belay to gain the prominent corner.\n\nP5 - 5.11-, 6 bolts, 55m (gear belay). A superb pitch. Stem up the corner and throw some furry hand jams in the moss for 15m, then cut out right onto the steep face. Adventurous and sporty climbing leads through some generously spaced bolts to the base of a crack. The crack improves in quality with every jam, culminating in a stellar hand crack finish as the angle kicks back.\n\nP6 - 5.7, 15m (can probably link w P5 as 70m rope stretching mega pitch). Layback the corner to the right, then make a slab move back left to gain the anchor.\n\nP7 - 5.11- A0, 7 bolts, 40m. The crux pitch. Slab climb up and right to reach a bolt protected thin seam. Most of the climbing is 5.11 and there is 3-bolt ladder to get you through two moves, which could probably be freed at 11+ or 12- we estimate. Gain a slightly dirty thin crack.\n\nP8 - 5.10+, 6 bolts, 45m. Follow bolts up and left to the base of a right facing corner. The next anchor is under a bulge-like roof above.\n\nP9 - 5.10-, 2 bolts, 50m. Traverse left past two bolts and climb through mixed corners. After ~40m you gain a grassy arete; scramble up and right to a bolted anchor on the small vertical wall.\n\nP10 - 5.8, 1 bolt, 50m. The angle kicks back here. Shorter sections of climbing and heather scrambling meander upwards. Climb up and right around a small pinnacle, then traverse hard left across heather to a bolted belay under a roof.\n\nP11 - 5.9 veg, 60m. Climb the vegetated gulley to the right and take the line of least resistance through another veggie corner. Easy but runout face climbing trends right to a bolted anchor.\n\nP12 - 5.9, 1 bolt, 50m. Climb around to the right, up a small groove, into another chimney groove with a bolt. Belay before the series of large blocky boulders.\n\nP13 - 5.10-, 50m. Heather scramble left toward a vegetated, splitter hand crack. Amble across right to another short crack. Belay bolts on the vertical wall.\n\nP14 - 5.8, 35m. Climb diagonal cracks back and forth to reach the gendarme that can be seen from camp!\n\nP15 - 5.5, 40m. Climb heather and unprotected slab to a final anchor at the top.Â \n\nRappel the route with 2x 70m ropes, skipping the gear belays. Note: atop pitch 6, rappel left over the roof and into the corner to reach the bolted anchor at the top of pitch 4. Rappel lengths are shown in the topo, the longest is ~65m.\n\n\n\nTo find the base of the route, head up the snow gulley between Cambrian Wall and Primordial Buttress. About 300m up the snow slope (Aug snow levels), cut out right and scramble up some 3rd class slabs and boulders, aiming for a wet, broken gulley. The route begins about 20m west of the gulley. 10m east of the gulley, you may find two bolts used for hauling over the slabs and roofs on the FA.\n\nSingle rack to 4\", doubles in your favourite sizes. <br /> Some long runners <br /> 2x 70m ropes <br /> All rappels and most anchor stations are bolted, but you may want to replace the rap webbing used at each."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"LszTsBKpVhO1iSaGyodu/g==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-129.24535,53.96178]}},"createdBy":"cA+doI87XbWNiXhFufH+Vw==","_change":{"user":"cA+doI87XbWNiXhFufH+Vw==","historyId":"64140ab3f0cf0083295f2d70","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:37:39.575Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,4abf16c9-6586-5dd2-88ed-6f7c0cae544e,1477e90a-f451-5a75-9d84-e02432b2601d,2eccd3b0-12a9-5613-b589-2686ca876efe","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Northern BC","Pangea","Primordial Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-129.24535,53.96178]},"bbox":[-129.24611430602755,53.96133033981813,-129.24458569397243,53.96222966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"LszTsBKpVhO1iSaGyodu/g=="},"content":{"description":"A prominent buttress on Chiq Pk, North side of the valley.
