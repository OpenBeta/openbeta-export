Regardless, it's a neat town but most recreational venues are still another 30mins-1 hr drive from the town center. Low potential for alpine rock but hugely popular for ice climbers due to the insane amount of waterfalls, as well as some interesting venues for rock climbing without much information available online. BC Peace Region Climbers facebook page is the best source of information.
