Rock is conglomerate/coarse grained sandstone, exactly like Hassler. Trad routes very similar in characteristic of Hassler with large flakes that are sometimes very suspect and a few solid cracks. The main difference being there a LOT of potential boulder cracks here. Potential for anything between 5-15m. The boulders formed when the upper sandstone layer of Mt Babcock slipped down the lower shale layer, forming a large field of small towers and boulders. The only area here that I could find online information for, and seems to have the most concentrated development, is the Roman Road/Chimney Rock area. However, there is an assortment of TR anchors and bolted routes in other zones.\n\nA lot of routes here are in the sun but still shady options abound. Regardless, it's sub-alpine so may want to wait until snow has melted in these regions. After a hot day climbing in the sun check out the alpine tarn a few minutes up the trail and take a dip."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"X4L7BlxnVgK7E1NguNq6Ew==","historyId":"64140be4f0cf0083295f39cf","prevHistoryId":"64140be3f0cf0083295f39c4","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:42:43.501Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:52.324Z","updatedBy":"X4L7BlxnVgK7E1NguNq6Ew=="}
