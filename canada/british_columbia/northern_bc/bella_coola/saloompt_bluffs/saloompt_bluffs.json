Each pitch adds to the adventure; even the first pitch on it's own is a satisfying climb gaining a fine position. A mix of fun cracks and thin face climbing. This is the first line on the first wall when approaching via Lower Bluffs trail.\n\n3 Pitches: 5.9, 5.11a +1pa, 5.11b. Rap rings at every belay. 70m rope recommended for first pitch. Double 60m ropes will get you down.\n\nPitch 1 - Start up a thin flake on the far right of the wall, to a bolted face, and finally up a splendid hand crack to a belay stance above a small cedar tree. 65m 5.9\nPitch 2 - Continue up an easy right trending ramp, past some gear in an undercling to the first bolt. A couple hard moves lead to more thin moves, moving up and right to gain a faint arete. Climb the prow and thin ground above with difficulty to the last bolt, and use it for a short pendulum into the prominent flake. Jam the friendly flake up to a belay ledge. 60m 5.11a +1pa\nPitch 3 - The difficulties begin immediately, mantling onto the starting ledge and first bolt. Continue up through thin friction and face climbing past 10 bolts, to a faint exit crack trending left (small TCUs), past a final bolt to belay. 40m 5.11b\n\nhttps://bellacoolatrails.ca/content/ganeshas-game\n\n\nGear to 2\", with doubles in 0.75-1\" range. 14 quickdraws at least."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"k1MQT5H2WBa70AS/rzDB8g==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-126.54874,52.40929]}},"createdBy":"PDJALBGyVP6v81hdtkG57Q==","_change":{"user":"PDJALBGyVP6v81hdtkG57Q==","historyId":"641409fff0cf0083295f2582","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:34:39.660Z"},{"_id":"BbORI0bkS4Sjxyy0H316Ew==","name":"Tips Hotline","grades":{"yds":"5.11"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"May 2020","length":152,"content":{"description":"\nA three pitch all-gear route up the left edge of the broken-glass wall. 2nd pitch is a 65m tips-layback endurance challenge; clean rock, lots of pro, spicy cruxes and good rests. Bring 70m rope, and an extra 60m to get down. Bolted rap stations. Many small cams required (esp. Metolius #0 and #1 range).\n\nPitch 1 - 5.9 layback flake (an existing route, name unknown). A gem of a pitch, and a fun treat to start the day. Clambour up a blocky corner to the base of a left trending flake; layback the flake to the tree island, then continue through the brush to the Pitch 2 anchors at the bottom of the next wall. Gear to 3\".\nPitch 2 - 5.11 (?) tips layback. Follow the steepening corner crack for ~15m until it branches right into a thin crack feature splitting the blank headwall. Overcome the steep crux to a good rest, then continue through another 30-40m of tips laybacking. A physically and mentally demanding pitch. Bring many small cams and some nuts.\nPitch 3 - 5.10+ layback funkjam. Climb steeply through overlapping flakes to the top of a small pedestal and an old stunted pine tree. Mantle up into the groove above, and continue up a mix of flakes and cracks to easier ground. Enjoy the final face moves to gain the upper slab and anchors.\n\n\n\nApproach via Lower Bluffs trail:  <a href=\"https://bellacoolatrails.ca/content/saloompt-bluffs\">bellacoolatrails.ca/contentâ€¦</a>\n\nNuts and many small cams required (esp.
