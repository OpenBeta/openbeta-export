There's been minimal scrubbing and development of a few problems but the potential is high for some good, hard problems here. As with the rest of the rock climbing around town, expect to scrub off moss as traffic is light. Two of the main boulders are listed in this area but, at least for the one, it's named only for the sake of clarification as it hasn't actually been successfully climbed yet by the harder problems. Bears frequent the trail as well and the mosquitoes love the bare and brazen arms of boulderers who have forgotten bug spray. Whatever temps exist around the rest of the world, this corner is always cool due to some kind of pooling, cold, underground air that persists around these boulders, thus the name Frigidaire."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140a18f0cf0083295f2686","prevHistoryId":"64140a18f0cf0083295f267c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:35:00.447Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:46.565Z","updatedBy":"6a0eusYTU3eIYBXbB7Zdfw=="}
