A hard start involves heinous underclings, powerful laybacks and intense core strength to rock up onto somewhat glassy feet.

But the climbing is great and the potential for an excellent crag is definitely here. Only two lines have been cleaned and scrubbed, a third was started but abandoned due to difficulty. There is potential for easily a dozen more climbs. All that's needed is a few scrub brushes and this 20m-30m tall wall will clean up well.
