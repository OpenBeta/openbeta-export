Just a short side trip on Highway 37A towards Stewart, the Bear Glacier descends towards Strohn Lake, down Bear River Pass. \n  \n Ice once filled all of the pass, but in the 1940â€™s, the glacier began to retreat and Strohn Lake formed in the exposed basin. In 1967, Bear Glacier melted away from the valley wall and Strohn Lake was no longer dammed. Since then the glacier has continued its retreat.\" \n  \n  -BC Parks Website \n  \n The same website states that the day use area for this park has been closed - presumably because of rockfall and construction going on near the road. They do say you can view the glacier from the large pullout, no mention of whether it is allowed to cross over to the glacier and no signs about it in person.
