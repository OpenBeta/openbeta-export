This area has many developed boulders/problems and is located at the base of Copper Mountain. This area has easy access walking or driving and is located nearby many sport, mixed, trad, and multipitch routes. There's plenty of parking space along the hydro line and everything can be accessed by foot from there.  There is a good mix of sun exposed and shaded boulders.  Many of the boulders have flat ground and moderate heights for safe falls. \n\nThe approaches are all easy, many are only a few meters from the road access."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140b15f0cf0083295f311c","prevHistoryId":"64140b13f0cf0083295f30ff","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":15,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:38:32.716Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:12.723Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
