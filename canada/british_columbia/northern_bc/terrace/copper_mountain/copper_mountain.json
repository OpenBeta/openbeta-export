There is a good variety of routes from single pitches to 9 pitches long. Routes often involve a combination of slab and crack climbing. There has been a significant amount of large rockfalls recently, so use caution. Just because a route is cleaned and bolted doesn't mean it is safe. Many routes involve the liberal use of suspect blocks that will someday come down."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140b5bf0cf0083295f343e","prevHistoryId":"64140b59f0cf0083295f342d","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:38:29.960Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:20.217Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
