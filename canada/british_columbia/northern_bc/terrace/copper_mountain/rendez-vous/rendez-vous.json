Difficulties gradually increase up to some balancy face climbing on the arête, then easy climbing on chickenheads to the bolted anchor on a ledge. \n  \n P2 : 5.10 (Trad+) Climb up past two bolts to the splitter corner crack. Wild stemming on good jams leads up to an airy hanging belay under the roof. Take advantage of the seat to rest your feet! \n  \n P3 : 5.10- (Trad) Undercling traverse along the roof out right to gain the second hanging diehedral. Manage the rope drag through the roof crack by leaving gear or otherwise. Follow this up and right to a stance on the face. Climb the corner crack above past good finger locks and stemming to a belay ledge.  \n  \n P4 : 5.10- (5.11+) Two options (mixed): \n 5.10- From the belay ledge at the top of P3, downclimb a short 4th class section on the right using a fixed line to another set of anchors at the base of a finger crack (can use this as top belay for P3 with a re-direct off the belay ledge anchors). Climb the splitter finger crack up to a stance on the arête. Traverse right into the top of the ‘Wildfire’ corner pitch of Rendezvous and finish at the anchors. \n 5.11+ From the belay ledge step right and up onto the face towards the bolt. The crux is moving past the bolt with steep slab/face trickery on small holds to join the crack on the right. Finish as per the 5.10- variation; or continue above the crack past bolts on the arête and a bouldery crux to the big ledge above Wildfire (project). \n space \n Rappel the route or rappel from the top of Wildfire pitch down and right using the Rendezvous anchors on the main face. Can rappel either route with 60 m rope and multiple rappels.\n\nApproach on Rendez-vous trail, at the top of the fixed line look left for bolts on sweeping ramp arrête leading to the steep yellow dihedral. The seat should be visible in the main book before a traverse.\ndouble rack to C4, quickdraws"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"7u8v3XPjVgSeH9NF+w58pA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-128.50035,54.5149]}},"createdBy":"LIQ4QgfAU4SwRx7kMe25mw==","_change":{"user":"LIQ4QgfAU4SwRx7kMe25mw==","historyId":"64140b50f0cf0083295f33ae","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:40:16.140Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,4abf16c9-6586-5dd2-88ed-6f7c0cae544e,d898d143-23ce-5b05-ad52-925c568fc0a2,993e4050-487a-5260-a6af-e934aabb100e,eeef2fdd-73e3-5604-9e1f-d345fb0e7ca4","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Northern BC","Terrace","Copper Mountain","Rendez-vous"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-128.50035,54.5149]},"bbox":[-128.50112462012308,54.514450339818154,-128.49957537987694,54.51534966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"7u8v3XPjVgSeH9NF+w58pA=="},"content":{"description":"Great mix of slabs and corners which culminate in a large roof."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140b50f0cf0083295f33ae","prevHistoryId":"64140b4ff0cf0083295f33a8","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:40:14.080Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:59.718Z","updatedBy":"LIQ4QgfAU4SwRx7kMe25mw=="}
