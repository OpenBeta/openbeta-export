Fire through the incredible tips crack crux using the arête on the right, making technical balancy moves. The crack gradually widens above the bolt to take good small gear. The crack dog-legs through a small lip and one more steep section before a nice belay ledge (new anchor bolts). Aiding the first couple moves of the fingertip crack or avoiding them by climbing high and left would drop the grade to 5.9 C1. The addition of the bolt has made the route is considerably more safe (avoids gear-pulling groundfall potential) but still has a touch of spice, get on it!\n\nP2. - 5.8, 30m. Follow the obvious splitter crack up from the belay ledge that goes on for days at a nice moderate grade. A touch tricky clipping the anchors above the lip. It’s a beautiful finger crack and well worth the pain of the fingertip section on P1. A recent effort removed the loose rocks perched at the top of this pitch.\n\nDescent: Two 30m rappels off bolted anchors.\n\nFollow the trail from the power line road and its the first climb you come across once you reach the upper section of the wall.\nOdd bolt throughout.
