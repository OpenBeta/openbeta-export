Climb a series of buldges with ledges between. A good lead but the ledges do make a fall in some spots a bad idea. Top rope option around the left side of the wall following the trail. Turn right when the trail splits up higher. Should be a tree with cordelette to indicate where to drop in (it is necessary to rappel off this cordelette to access the anchors of the climb. Definitely not a popular climb by any means so be prepared for dirt, loose rocks and debris.
