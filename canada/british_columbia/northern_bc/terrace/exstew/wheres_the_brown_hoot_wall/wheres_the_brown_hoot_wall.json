The author is unknown to me. I will gladly remove if not allowed.  Just trying to help share information on this route.\n\nP1 30m 5.8 - 9 bolts\nClimb up and left out of a cave clipping bolts to the top of a pedestal. Step left around the Arete and back right following bolts up to a large belay ledge above.\n\nP2 30m 5.8 - 11 bolts\nClimb left of the belay and up to a bolt above. Follow bolts up to a belay stance.\n\nP3 20m 5.7 - 5 bolts\nClimb above belay following four bolts to a grassy ledge. Traverse left and look for a bolt on the face. Climb up to the bolts and make a short traverse left to belay.\n\nP4 25m 5.7 - 7 bolts\nMove left around a large roof through a small overhang and carry on up to belay above. It is possible to rappel from this point. Heading left from the top of P4 accesses Wynona's Big Brown Beaver (5.9).\n\nP5 30m 5.5 - 10 bolts\nClimb up past bolts angling rightward to a large ledge that runs across the face of the climb.\n\nP6 30m 5.8 - 14 bolts\nTraverse right along the ledge past the rappel anchors and move up to a bolt. Climb up a short pedestal, clip bolt, and continue to make an upward traverse right past more bolts to belay.\n\nP7/8 40m 5.8 - 12 bolts\nShared anchor with Hootenanny. Climb up through thin face moves to easier terrain. Use a long runner on the P8 anchors and continue out left towards a tree growing out over the roof. Climb the left side of the tree to gain the roof and move up to a tree belay.\n\nDescent\nFrom the tree belay move left along the ledge for approximately 5 meters and move down past a large tree making exposed moves down to a two ring bolt anchor. It's best to be roped up to get to the rappel anchors. From the anchor move down the wall 25 meters and angle climbers left a short ways to reach a small lip of rock just above where it gets steep. From here you can make five 30 meter rappels to the ground. It is possible to bail at the top of Pitch 2 and off the Pitch 5 ledge.\n\n\n\nHike up the trail to towards the base of the Exstew sport wall. After climbing the log staircase you will come to a massive boulder with a vertical face.  Look for a trail heading out left and follow flagging to a cave where the climb begins.  Work has recently been done to upgrade the belay stance at the cave. \n\nBolts with rappel rings at rappel stations."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"DkcV1l4iWzGwV+AIg2n/kw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-129.07255,54.43189]}},"createdBy":"dZxefFyNWX2e8P3xg84tpA==","_change":{"user":"dZxefFyNWX2e8P3xg84tpA==","historyId":"64140b8bf0cf0083295f3644","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T06:41:15.235Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,4abf16c9-6586-5dd2-88ed-6f7c0cae544e,d898d143-23ce-5b05-ad52-925c568fc0a2,bd1ffade-1bea-58de-b46c-ca3b7bf37d2f,0e4715d6-5e22-5b31-b057-e0088369ff93","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Northern BC","Terrace","Exstew","Where's the Brown Hoot Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-129.07255,54.43189]},"bbox":[-129.0733230498986,54.431440339818145,-129.0717769501014,54.43233966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"DkcV1l4iWzGwV+AIg2n/kw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-129.0733230498986,54.431440339818145],[-129.0717769501014,54.431440339818145],[-129.0717769501014,54.43233966018185],[-129.0733230498986,54.43233966018185],[-129.0733230498986,54.431440339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"Home to three exceptional sport multipitch routes, this wall is located nearby the other other Exstew crags.
