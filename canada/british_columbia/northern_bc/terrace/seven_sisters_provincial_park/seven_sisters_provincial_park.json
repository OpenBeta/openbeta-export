The upper portion of the massif is glaciated with a long east-west summit ridge that is home to seven named summits. From west to east: Tlooki Peak (2571 m), Weeskinisht Peak (2747 m), Tagai Peak (2660 m), Tingi Peak (2534 m), Kitshin Peak (2580 m), Kletoosho Peak (2597 m), Tuatoosho Peak (2621 m). There's an eights unnamed Sister on the eastermost end of the summit ridge. The north face of the massif is an impressive but loose rock wall that runs along the full length of the summit ridge with numerous unclimbed couloirs. \n On the north side of the massif lies the Outpost Peaks group, which is lower than the summit ridge group but nevertheless an important mountaineering objective. A mining road reaches the alpine just west of the summit ridge, and this is the standard approach route. \n  \n Neal Carter climbed the highest (Weeskinisht) in 1941, most of the rest were climbed in 1962. Sister Seven remained until 1967."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140bbff0cf0083295f3842","prevHistoryId":"64140bbdf0cf0083295f383c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:42:03.441Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:49.856Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
