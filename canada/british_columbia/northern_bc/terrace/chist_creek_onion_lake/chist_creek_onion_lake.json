The rock is rough granite which is quite fractured and of variable quality, so protection should be placed carefully. Despite the rough nature of the rock and short length of many of the routes, Onion is a fairly popular climbing area in the Terrace area due to its easy access and the reasonably large number of climbs. This area has been designated Chist Creek Recreation Area by the BC Forest Service, and picnic tables, a couple campsites with fire rings, and an outhouse have been installed.  The site is 'User Maintained' so please treat it respectfully and leave it better than how you found it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64140adcf0cf0083295f2ee1","prevHistoryId":"64140adaf0cf0083295f2edb","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T06:38:16.660Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:12.005Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
