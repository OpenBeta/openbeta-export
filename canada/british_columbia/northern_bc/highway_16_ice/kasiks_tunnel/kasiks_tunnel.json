It looks like a solid 3 with some short steps of 4. Pretty stout, the flow reaches all the way to the ground and is about 100'. This one is still looking for a FA.\n\nHopefully the pullout is plowed when you get there or you'll have to dig it out yourself. There is no place else to park for a long ways in either direction. You can see it from the highway behind the trees.\nPretty standard for ice climbing.
