The rock is high grade gneiss that has been carved into rounded and elongated fins called roche moutonnees (before climbing as a sport, the herders of the Alps thought these fairly common glacial landforms looked like \"rock sheep\").   \n  \n Huge lakes fill the Okanogan Valley below the crags of Skaha, remnants of long gone glaciers.  The Canadian North Cascades create a rain-shadow effect and the valley is one of the driest in British Columbia.   \n  \n INTERIOR PLATEAU OF BRITISH COLUMBIA MAP \n  \n On the map below, black dashes outline the Interior Plateau.
