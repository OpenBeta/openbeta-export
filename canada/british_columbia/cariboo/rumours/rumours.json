Rumours wall is north facing, over hung enough to stay dry in light rain, with big tree canopies to keep it cool in the hot summer months.  \n  \n There will be more single pitch crags added in shortly, with more compiled information"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413fb38f0cf0083295e7bf3","prevHistoryId":"6413fb36f0cf0083295e7bed","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:31:33.066Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:36.481Z","updatedBy":"UUmL5MY7XPS/HyXz3mVZOA=="}
