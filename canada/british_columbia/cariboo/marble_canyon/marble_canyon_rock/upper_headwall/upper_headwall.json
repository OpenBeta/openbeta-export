Due to this geology, loose rock and rock fall should be expected. Climbers need to be aware of this characteristic when sharing routes with other parties, especially when rappelling. Tread lightly.  It is normal for holds to break in the beginning of a new route's lifecycle. Expect loose rock on routes particularly along the edges of routes if you start pawing around looking for better holds. Try to stay within the confines of the bolt line to mitigate your risk of falling when you encounter crumbly rock, and to decrease risk of rockfall to climbers below.\n\nMarble Canyon has a lot of rock debris and scree on ledges that loom over routes. During high winds and heavy rainfall (rain bursts and thunder storms), debris is dislodged and is prone to falling. Water-saturated scree slopes and debris on the large terrace above the Lower Apron routes (and large ledges on all routes) create debris flows over the lower walls. Climbers have been caught on Lower Apron routes during sudden rain bursts and been thankful to have survived after being pummelled by debris torrents and sudden water cascades.\n\nPlease also note, these same debris flows can be large and are subject to suddenly closing the highway to traffic when they flow out and block traffic. This is a reality that locals know well. Thankfully, the climate in this region is typically arid and sunny most of the year so rainfall is limited but this does effect the landscapes ability to cope with sudden rain bursts and thunder showers.\n\nDespite being bolted, routes should be treated as alpine climbs, with respect to rock quality, commitment required, and weather events. Rain should be considered a serious threat due to the landscape not having evolved to absorb the water. Runoff leads to landslides, debris flows, and rockfall unlike other climbing areas. ***Rappel off routes at the first signs of grey clouds and rain***  \n\nA fundraiser through GoFundMe called Marble Mega Multipitch (Guaranteed Rugged 10d) can be accessed at https://gofund.me/9f59fcde.\n\n\n\nGuaranteed Rugged is guaranteed to be an adventure. Climbing from the base of the Lower Apron to the summit of Main Wall, this route covers 1068m of limestone in 33 pitches, making it the longest bolted climb in North America. The route can be characterized by three distinct sections: the slabby lower apron, the steep exposed headwall, and the final ridge to the summit. \n\nWith the amount of terrain and distance covered, the climbing stays varied and interesting along the entire length. Smooth, grey, compact, slabby pitches are mixed with stucco-like textured face pitches. Edges, pockets, and stucco flowstone - stippled throughout the route - are highly enjoyable to climb. Climbers will be required to move seamlessly though different styles of climbing in order to climb quickly. \n\n<strong>Lower Apron  </strong>\n\nThe first 19 pitches characterize the lower apron and mid-section of climbing. Lower angle pitches are interspersed with steeper walls. Superb quality, grey limestone is interspersed with orange, friable sections. The majority of the pitches in this section are between 5.6-5.8, with a handful of steeper pitches to surmount as you ascend. \n\n<strong>Steep Headwall</strong>\n\nThe steep, exposed headwall always looms overhead, growing more intimidating as you climb nearer. At the top of pitch 19, there is a distinct shift to steeper terrain. The exquisite, grey corner of pitch 20 suddenly feels extremely exposed as the elevation becomes pronounced. Multiple crux pitches will test your arms and your mental fortitude. \n\n<strong>Final Ridge</strong>\n\nAt the top of pitch 25, reprieve is in sight as the angle eases again. Difficulty falls to your legs and your stamina to keep pushing upward. At this point, it is easier and safer to continue to the top versus bailing via rappels. The final 5.9 pitch is one of the finest on route with steep, exposed climbing far above the valley.   \n\n\nLocated in Marble Canyon provincial Park, BC Canada. The Main Wall across from Pavilion Lake is impossible to miss. Climbers mostly camp at Marble Canyon Provincial campground located on Crown Lake. \n\n<strong>Parking</strong>\n\nFind Marble Canyon Provincial campground. From the west entrance it is 2.1km further west to the pullout along Hwy 99 where you can park. Camping and campfires are prohibited at the highway pullouts. These activities will compromise access and parking. \n\n<strong>Approach</strong>\n\n25mins - easy hiking, minor scramble section\n\nThe approach trail is located directly behind a large green highway sign (distances to Lillooet, Pemberton, Whistler, Vancouver). Follow the trail uphill through parkland grasses and trees, twisting and turning here and there. High up on the trail, scramble 3rd class through a distinct red band of rock. From here, angle up rightward to where the trail notably turns right, traversing sidehill to red dirt. Looking up leftward you will see a distinct red wall with an overhanging arch feature.

Bolted belay/rap station.    \n\n\n12 draws, 2 alpine draws. Bolts with bolted belay/rap anchors. 70m rope allows rappelling at any point.\n\n\nRappel at any belay/rap station with a single 70m rope. On pitch 15 you need to come off rappel on a big ledge and step down to the anchor on top of pitch 14. On the 3rd class pitches you will need to carefully down scramble to the rap anchors.\n\n\nThere is no cell service in this area so you will require a satellite communication device to signal for help. As a minimum, on a serious route like this, leave a note on your car dashboard with your objective and leave a plan with someone responsible at home. \n\nThere are several locations along the route that are large enough to sleep 2-4 people if caught out. The following pitches have areas that could suffice: pitch 14, pitch 17, pitch 19, pitch 25.\n\nThere is a great bivi spot at the top of the route in the forest. After the descent trail initially ascends, it bends sharp left crossing through a perfect flat bivi site. Within the rocks on the ground is located an orange bag with emergency supplies (emergency blanket, whisky).\n\n\n6km, descending 967m (3172ft)\n\nFrom the top of the route, scramble up to the trees and head left on the old climber's descent trail. The trail initially ascends uphill 80m before continuing left, wrapping around the rim of the Great Gully (on the left). The trail traverses in and out of several small ravines along route before beginning a steady descent downhill. Initially, the trail skirts downward along the rocky rim of the Great Gully (massive chasm on your left), veering right into the forest (marked by a cairn) about halfway around. Watch for the right-hand turn into the forest. This leads you down through the forest to the North Gully which will then take you most of the way down to the highway.   \n\nOnce in the North Gully, you essentially follow the gully downhill to the dry, grassy, treed slopes above the highway. A reasonably good old trail continues all the way down North Gully out to Hwy 99. You will pass several landmarks in the gully. The first of which is a large talus field - continue straight down across this. Second, you will encounter a beautiful waterfall spraying the right side of the wall. Fill bottles here if you're on empty. Third, you will encounter \"Horse Thief\" camp (an ancient fire ring and tin cans).\n\nThe last obstacle on your guaranteed rugged adventure are the fixed ropes. Carefully hand-line down several fixed ropes, descending two 5th class steps and lots of steep, loose terrain. Be careful of loose rocks and others below you. Once off the fixed ropes, hug the left gully wall and descend into \"The Junction\" where Dreamweaver gully joins on the left. \n\nFrom here, the ever-changing scree trail becomes more trail-like and distinct as you descend onto the dry forested grassland slopes. The trail continues left, traversing dusty grass slopes and descending to Hwy 99. At this point, you are approximately 600m west of your car and will need to turn left (east), walking the highway shoulder for 10mins back to where you parked.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"SAgYTmybXreAgY2YuAgivQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.70435,50.85125]}},"createdBy":"/wJHSPmCXh6lktIWpbGMpQ==","_change":{"user":"/wJHSPmCXh6lktIWpbGMpQ==","historyId":"6413fb33f0cf0083295e7bba","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:31:31.167Z"},{"_id":"SdwuH9q6QliqBdjRQQdtRg==","name":"None But The Brave (205)","grades":{"yds":"5.9"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"1991","length":394,"content":{"description":"This is an exciting route with a big wall feel to it.
