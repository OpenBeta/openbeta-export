Stay on route and avoid knocking loose rocks down if parties are below you, \n especially when topping out.\n\nA great route in a beautiful setting with the added allure of being one of the longest alpine sport climbs in Canada.  It has a short approach and a short descent considering the route length.  The route faces south, so pick your days accordingly.  Being a limestone route there is some loose rock but the climbing in the middle of the route is quite good.  The route can be rappelled with a single 60m rope, but if finishing the route to the top there is no reason not to do the walk off.\n\n Pitch 1 (5.5): 5 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 2 (5.8): 8 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 3: 60m Scramble up and slightly left, look for bolts near base of wall.\n Pitch 4 (5.6): 8 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 5 (5.8): 8 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 6 (5.5): 3 Bolts, 30m'\n For 11a variation continue straight up, for 5.8 variation continue up and right in the small gully to separate anchor\n Pitch 7 (5.11a): 9 Bolts, 25m Billy Goat Gruff Variation\n Pitch 7 (5.8): 9 Bolts, 25m\n Pitch 8 (5.8): 8 Bolts, 25m\n Pitch 9 (5.6): 5 Bolts, 25m\n Pitch 10 (5.8): 9 Bolts, 20m\n Pitch 11 (5.9): 12 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 12 (5.9): 10 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 13 (5.9): 10 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 14 (5.8): 8 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 15 (5.8): 8 Bolts, 25m\n Pitch 16 (5.7): 8 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 17 (5.8): 10 Bolts, 30m\n Pitch 18 (5.8): 8 Bolts, 25m\n Pitch 19: 60m 3/4 class scramble up and slightly left to a pine tree at the base of the wall above.\n\nDescent: From the pine tree traverse left (NE) around until you see a large rock that looks like a 3m high pillar.  Walk between the pillar and the wall and look around the corner to the right for a 2-bolt rappel anchor.  A 20m rappel drops you into a gully that can be walked all the way to the highway, approx. 45-60mins from the top of the route. Bring boots (and gloves) for the unpleasant steep descent.\n\nThe route is found on the wall to the left of the large gully system that splits the two walls.  Park at a gravel pull out at the base of a dry creek bed, coordinates 50.8479997, -121.7095846 or 2.0km westbound from the Marble Canyon Provincial Park entrance. Follow this dry creek bed up hill for approximately 15mins to where it meets the wall. The trail is generally well-marked with orange flagging tape.A nearby apron trail is marked with pink flagging tape. Be warned, if you use the eastern-most pullout and you start from the pink flagged apron trail at the road, your approach will be much more than 15 minutes, sufficiently convoluted, and generally less enjoyable.\nAll pitches are fully bolted and all anchors are two bolt anchors with rappel rings or maillons. Most pitches can be linked with a 60m rope, depending on your willingness for rope drag. However, the original topo only mentions following 60m link-ups:Pitch 1 &amp; 2, can be linked with 60m ropePitch 4 &amp; 5, can be linked with 60m ropePitch 10 &amp; 11, can be linked with 60m ropeNote: You can start on Pitch 4 by hiking in from the left or from the right if approaching from the trail with pink flagging."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"RMIjDqvXWCmoEv1gq2gb9w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.70927,50.85297]}},"createdBy":"OQ6ung8UV4e9v9mLAqKLwg==","_change":{"user":"OQ6ung8UV4e9v9mLAqKLwg==","historyId":"6413fb27f0cf0083295e7b37","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:31:19.185Z"},{"_id":"C4isjaxWQECBv4MTGc6uxQ==","name":"Rat Race (199)","grades":{"yds":"5.8"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Garry Brace, Randy Stevens -1979","length":242,"content":{"description":"From the top of the 2nd pitch of Dreamweaver, head up and slightly right to a tree belay.
