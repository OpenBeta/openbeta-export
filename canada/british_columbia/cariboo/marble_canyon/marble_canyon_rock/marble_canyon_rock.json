The limestone canyon in which Marble Canyon Provincial Park is located is a rare geological formation in British Columbia, and this is not some small sport climbing bluff  at its full height Marble Canyon is over 800 metres (&gt;2,600 feet) high and many kilometres long.\n\nMarble Canyon is made up of a Headwall (500 metres) that sits on top of a large Apron (250 metres)  the headwall and apron are split by a huge treed sloping terrace (it takes approximately 20-30 minutes to walk from the top of the apron, up the terrace, to the base of the headwall). The headwall is bordered on its left by a massive gully (naturally named the Great Gully). To the left of the Great Gully is a smaller wall called Mid-Wall. The Mid Wall is bordered on is left side by another enormous gully called the North Gully.\n\nThe majority of the climbing occurs on the Apron, but there are routes on the Headwall, Mid Wall and North Gully Area as well.\n\nThere is a long history of climbing in the Canyon dating back to the 1950s, but there has been very little documented until recently. The most reliable source of documented information can be found in the Guidebook Central BC Rock by Lyle Knight. Keep in mind that Marble Canyon is a huge place, the terrain is very complex, and the guidebook only covers some of the more popular routes. If you plan to climb any of the multi-pitch climbs, good route finding skills are necessary. The rock in Marble Canyon is quite variable, ranging from beautiful grey bullet-proof limestone to manky rotten red limestone, and everything in between. Wear a helmet and be equipped to rappel from anywhere.\n\nThe climbing is generally in the moderate range (5.7 to 5.10). Climbs are protected with a mixture of natural gear and bolts. Keep in mind when climbing here, that almost all of the multi-pitch routes were put up on lead, and prior to 1992, the bolts were drilled by hand."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6413fb30f0cf0083295e7b9f","prevHistoryId":"6413fb2ff0cf0083295e7b8e","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T05:29:58.998Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T05:30:00.150Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
