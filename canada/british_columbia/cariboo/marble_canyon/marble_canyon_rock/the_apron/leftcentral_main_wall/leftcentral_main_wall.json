The technical climbing pitches are short and the ledge climbing follows long sections of trees and slabs. It’s a fast way to the summit from the car (6 hours on the first ascent, 9 car-to-car). The summit is 900 metres above the road. The route follows roughly 20 pitched-out pitches, but the first ascent team simul-climbing the easier terrain. The number of pitches will vary depending on the climbers. The rock is loose and it climbs more like an alpine trad route than a modern bolted multi-pitch. The north gully descent is hard to find with no trail. The first ascent team left a cairn on a ledge high up, but left no gear on the route.  Approach: Park at the base of the Great Wall and approach as for the Apron. Follow it up and right along scree and bushwhacking to the eastern edge below a large gully. Start at a big tree below two cracks.\n \nRoute: Up the left crack, loose and blocky (5.7) to below the gully. Up the gully and move right onto a treed ledge below a seam (5.8, a knifeblade would help here). Up the ramps above, finding the line of weakness. Stay left on the prow (pitch 5 on topo) and up loose and blocky bulges to upper trees. Follow ledges to the base of a buttress and chimney (5.8 good gear, pitch 8 on the topo). Up the buttress through trees to upper ledges. Move left, staying right of obvious corner crack (pitch 12) on easier terrain. At a treed junction, go up and right on steeper but solid rock (5.6). Cross scree gully up and left aiming for upper chimney (pitch 19) behind huge towers. Follow this to the summit with some 5.8 climbing through stemming sections. From the top, go west to the summit.\n \nDescent: Follow the ridge west to the Great Gully (don’t go down here). Continue north in trees for 100-ish metres to an obvious depression west below a small sub-peak. If you can see the backside, you’ve gone too far. Head down the gully (passing some flagging tape and a cairn or two) for about an hour. At a waterfall, go up some scree then down to steep drops. Four rappels off small trees will get you to scree below. Continue down to Function Junction (sport routes) and the intersect with Dreamweaver Gully (descent for The Goat) and better trails. You could rappel from trees on The Donkey if you had some slings and two ropes. Just make sure you don’t rappel into some void by mistake. \n \nThe name: Unlike Danny’s route The Goat, which climbs techy slabs, The Donkey follows the line of least resistance from the road to the summit. If there was a donkey trail to the top, this would be it. It’s a scrappy line, more of an adventure than pure rock climbing.

See below for updated descent.\n\nMarble Canyon is a limestone crag.  Due to the nature of the geology, loose rock and the occasional rock fall should be expected. Climbers should be mindful of this characteristic when sharing the route with other parties, especially when rappelling. Try to tread lightly.  It is normal for some holds to break in the beginning of a new route's lifecycle.  In particular, Marble Canyon has a lot of small rock debris on ledges that loom over routes. During high winds or after heavy rainfall, debris is dislodged and is prone to falling. Water-saturated gravel from the large terrace above (below the Main Wall) can create mini debris flows over the lower wall. Thankfully, the climate in this region is typically arid and sunny most of the year so rainfall is limited.\n\n \n\nPitch 1, 5.8:\n\nStart 50m down and right of Sisyphus on a bolted arete. Climb the arete (stay on arete) past 6 bolts to a two-bolt anchor on a small ledge. 22m, 6 bolts. UPDATE: 3 new bolted routes have been added to the wall left and right of the arete start (5.9-10b).\n\nPitch 2, 4th:\n\nScramble up a 4th class slab to another two-bolt anchor on the wall beside a large, coniferous tree. 15m, no bolts. \n\nPitch 3, 5.7:\n\nBegin left of anchor. Climb up to first bolt, then diagonally up right to the arete. Follow the arete up to a ledge with a dead tree and two-bolt anchor. 22m, 6 bolts.\n\nOption: link pitch 2 into pitch 3. Use some long slings to avoid rope drag. (40m, 6 bolts)\n\nPitch 4, 5.9:\n\nStep right from belay, then climb upward to the arete passing two bolts. At the steep wall, clip a high bolt on the left and reach for a jug. Pull up onto the face, then step gingerly left to the arete. Follow the arete past a tree with a cordalette to a two-bolt anchor. 35m, 8 bolts.\n\nMove belay 15m up and left on the terrace to a single bolt belay at the bottom of the slab.\n\nPitch 5, 5.7:\n\nClimb straight up the pocketed slab to a two-bolt anchor. 35m, 8 bolts.\n\nPitch 6, 5.6:\n\nTraverse right past a high bolt n the wall to a left-facing corner. Climb up the corner, trending right past three bolts to a good ledge with a two-bolt anchor. 20m, 4 bolts.\n\nOption: link pitch 5 and pitch 6. (55m, 12 bolts)\n\nPitch 7, 5.10a:\n\nClimb up and right from the belay to a bolt. Follow bolts as they meander up though interesting features to a two-bolt anchor on a ledge. 40m, 13 bolts.\n\nPitch 8, 5.9:\n\nClimb up directly above anchor into a groove. Trend leftward along a crack feature up to a small, overhanging bulge. Pull left over the bottom of the bulge, then up to the arete. Follow arete diagonally rightward to two-bolt anchor. 35m, 11 bolts.\n\nRappel the route from here or continue to the large, treed terrace.

Rap skier’s left from the top of pitch 5 to make it to the mid-route terrace (careful, it’s a rope-stretcher). From the mid-route, treed terrace find the rap anchor on the wall skiers left of the top of pitch 4. Rap straight down 4 times using bolted rap rings on the slab. On the third rap, go over a steep wall skiers right to find the last bolt anchor on the slab below.<br /><br />To rap from the bottom pitches (up to the first tree with a cordalette), rappel straight down the arete to the top of pitch 2.  From the anchors at the bottom of pitch 2, you can rap skiers right to a small ledge ~1m above the ground (careful, it's a rope-stretcher)\n\n\nMarble Canyon on the lower wall.\n\nApproach:\n\nPark at the gravel pullout on the lake side of the highway ~2kms north-west of the BC Parks Marble Canyon campsite (on Crown Lake). Cross the highway and follow a well-defined trail in front of a “littering fine” sign for 15 minutes up to the wall (turns into a scree-slope).
