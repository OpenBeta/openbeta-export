Most of the boulders only have lichen on the rock with some moss on the top outs. \n  \n Conditions: The boulders are mostly in an open setting which gives the area sun through most of the day and are quick to dry after the rain. The area is also high enough up the mountain to get winter sun and dry rock giving it year round climbing. \n  \n It was first developed in the summer of 2002 by Dave Ferguson and Jimmy Lapointe."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641414bff0cf0083295fa0c1","prevHistoryId":"641414bcf0cf0083295fa095","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":10,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:19:54.355Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:19:55.483Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
