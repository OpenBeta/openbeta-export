The cliffs get morning shade and sun in the afternoon. \n  \n Rock type is granite however it is a bit different than the granite of Squamish. A great variety of routes from slab to overhung. Almost all climbs here are sports climbs. Not as great of quality as the routes around Squamish but still worth a visit."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141319f0cf0083295f8d3c","prevHistoryId":"64141316f0cf0083295f8d17","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:12:59.939Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:47.793Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
