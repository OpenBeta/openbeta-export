Start up a low-gradient arete and climb easily to a ledge (medium nut partway up). Move left around a vague arete onto a steep to slightly overhanging face and climb up huge holds with good gear placements to an upper ledge. A 5.9 variant to the start (D. Brayshaw, J. Ford, C Campbell 2009) climbs a right-angling handcrack that begins 6 m to the left to the same ledge, avoiding the low-gradient start.\n\nAcross from the Courthouse at the tightest part of the canyon, just after you come out of a squeeze between a big boulder and the cliff wall. Look for the handcrack of the left variation to orient yourself.\nAll gear. Bring stuff up to #3 or #4 Camalot.
