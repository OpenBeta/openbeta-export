Other than the slog down the FSR, most of this route is above the tree line. Car to Car, this route can easily be done in 5-6 hours with a competent party. This route has a great ridge-line scramble with one, short, easy and enjoyable crux.\nEarly Summer is the best time to climb, when the talus slope after the creek crossing still is covered in snow.\n\nFrom the end of the FSR, follow a faint, steep trail down to Roe Creek. Cross the creek, and follow the talus/easy snow slope up to a large basin beneath the North face. Head to the right, and pick a line up to gain the NW ridge. With snow cover, you have many options and can pick a steeper &amp; shorter route. In the summer, follow the talus to the right of the small glacier, passing around it and up to the ridge.\n\nOnce on the ridge, head towards the summit. There is a 60ft crux with massive holds/ledges and minimal exposure.\n\nFrom the creek, follow the talus/easy snow slope up and to the right to gain the NW ridge.\nHelmet.
