This rig is way better than the Zombie Roof. It is mainly a hand and fist crack.\n\nStart inside the cave to the right and gain an horizontal crack. Traverse left to right underneath the roof crack. Climb the roof and get psyched for the lip encounter (crux)! There is a bolt at the lip that was placed the FAist in order to prevent to rope from entering the crack when it gets tensioned.\n\nI slung a big chockstone right before the roof and left a biner to make cleaning the route less pain in the ass.\n\n\n\nFollow cairns into the talus to get to Pony Wall.
