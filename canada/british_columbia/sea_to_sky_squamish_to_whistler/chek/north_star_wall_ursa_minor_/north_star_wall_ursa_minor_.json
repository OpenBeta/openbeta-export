You will end up back at the campground using a different route than your hike in (so don't leave anything at the base of the route).\n\nTo get to the base of the route: take hwy 99 until you get to Conroy Forest Road and take a left. Go up the road for a minute until you see an obvious small parking lot on the left and campsites. Park here if possible and hike out the other end of the parking lot 40m (further away from the road you just drove up) until you get to an obvious trail to your right (photo in the quickdraw pubs website). Hike up this trail about 15 minutes through forest and boulder field until you get to the base of Ursa Minor.\n\nevery pitch has hangers and the first few also have rap rings (I guess in case you give up early?)\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"tS15NEPPWKm4aEHPcg3j5g==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.16297,49.91498]}},"createdBy":"UDVtXXOCUeaJP1rKfrhqiw==","_change":{"user":"UDVtXXOCUeaJP1rKfrhqiw==","historyId":"641413c1f0cf0083295f960c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:16:17.642Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,e552f824-165c-58f7-8102-f3bab4832c0a,95db726d-5c55-59a1-8f1f-cfdf79550c92,b52d7934-43cf-58a9-b868-41cf720de3e6","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Sea to Sky (Squamish to Whistler)","Chek","North Star Wall  “Ursa Minor “"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.16297,49.91498]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"tS15NEPPWKm4aEHPcg3j5g=="},"content":{"description":"A pleasant multi pitch"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641413c1f0cf0083295f960c","prevHistoryId":"641413c0f0cf0083295f9606","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:16:15.413Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:16:17.651Z","updatedBy":"UFfMdeYxUYC4KHK5oW4PAA=="}
