This crag has mostly 5.12s/+ for people looking for some hard climbing. There are a handful of moderate fun routes as well, but the mildly overhanging walls of The Monastery seem to favor the natural formation of harder climbs. Like many areas of chek, there are some routes with an initial pitch and an added extension for some extra credit. The climbing of this area is great and varied, demanding a wide skill set from powerful overhang to technical face, dihedrals and delicate slab (due to how the walls form very varied terrain, depending which area you find yourself in).\n\nThis area is broken up into 4 main parts. From left to right is, the left sector, the prow, the cave, And the right sector. The trail from the lower lot drops you off by the left sector. This wall is short and steep, a steep overhang with a ledge through the middle. Then is the prow, a solid continuous overhanging wall (about 30degrees). The next section around the prow is mostly vert, and well capped from the rain. The right sector has varied terrain. A few climbs run through the steeper wall(pump junkies 12d) and then around the corner are a few more climbs that go up the vert/slab ish face (satori 11a, water tension 12b)\n\nRoutes here generally get morning sun and afternoon shade, with the exception of Prancercise 12c that sits in the shade of nearby trees.\n\nA free topo is available for download here (scroll down and click the link)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641413bbf0cf0083295f95d6","prevHistoryId":"641413bbf0cf0083295f95cc","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":22,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:15:56.767Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:06.221Z","updatedBy":"91X+VHVzWE2tWVfMxTkJ0Q=="}
