It includes such crags as Cheakamus Canyon, Rogues Gallery, Alice Lake and many more.  Some are just a few km north of Squamish others up to half an hour drive up the highway. \n  \n While it's very close to Squamish and the Chief, the rock is quite different.  It's still granite, but it's of a much more smooth and compact nature.  It rarely lends itself to trad climbing, but makes for excellent sport climbing.  This area is home to many hundreds of sport climbs of all grades, right up to 5.14c. \n  \n The climbing tends to be vertical or overhanging and there's enough variety to find huge roof routes, vertical crimp-fests, endurance marathons as well as bouldery power routes.  While the climbing tends toward 5.11 and higher, there are some excellent, properly bolted 5.9 and 5.10 routes as well. \n  \n One of this area's notable features, in addition to excellent climbing, is the possibility to climb in the rain on quite a number of routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641414fcf0cf0083295fa31a","prevHistoryId":"641414e5f0cf0083295fa22f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":17,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:11:16.038Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:20.254Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
