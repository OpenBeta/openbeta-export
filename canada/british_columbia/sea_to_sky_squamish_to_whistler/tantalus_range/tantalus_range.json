A mixed bag of metamorphosed granite (like Chek canyon)  good rock and 'alpine' rock, glaciers, summits, grand views, huts and some terrible weather. This place has it all. \n  \n This page is meant to be just a simple place to list all of the topos that are in the various spots for climbing here. The guidebook, Kevin Mclane's SW Select is great, but outdated and there is a ton of new routes and scattered info. So...add stuff, take away, etc...let's make this a great community resource. I took pictures of all the hut book topos and ones friends have sent along and am just putting them in one place."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641414f9f0cf0083295fa2fc","prevHistoryId":"641414f7f0cf0083295fa2eb","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:21:09.261Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:19.411Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
