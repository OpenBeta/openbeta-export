Goes through twelve bolts, staying pretty vertical until around the seventh bolt. \n  \n Depending on skill level there are two cruxes, the first being right after the seventh bolt, and the second being higher up on some pumpy crimp moves for the last couple bolts.  The whole route is at a gentle overhang as well, so it can get pumpy, but it is punctuated with a few good rest jugs/horns along the way. \n  \n Make sure to stay left of the bolts as you get higher up.  It is very tempting to traverse right to some big chalked up holds. Do not. You will find large wobbly blocks waiting to be dislodged and hit someone below, followed by a pile of sharp, flaky choss. Stay under or left of the bolt line and you will be fine.\n\nWhen you get to the Marble Wall for the first time, you'll see there's a platform made out of stacked logs and some wooden scaffolding to the right of Attachment Theory and Attachment Issues.  There should be a sign up here that points to the starting bolt of The Climb Warp.
