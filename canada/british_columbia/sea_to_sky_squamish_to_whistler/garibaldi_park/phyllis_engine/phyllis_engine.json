Climb the rightmost crack next to the corner. Begins with a few meters of hand jams and quickly widens into an offwidth. This continues for a couple meters before solid hand jams, ring locks, and finger locks can be found. Traverse right afterwards to follow the low angle hand crack up to a slanted ledge – first belay.\n\nSecond pitch goes straight up the vertical cracks to the ledge. Traverse right into a hand crack and continue straight up. Mostly low angle except for the start and a small section in the middle.\n\nTraverse around the summit smokestack to the east side and follow the hand crack to the top.\n\nRappel off slung blocks. \n--------------\nIf climbing in the Spring, the approach on skis is quite reasonable. Definitely climbable, but expect ice and snow on the route. You will want to consider racking an ice axe to hack ice out of the cracks.\n\nThere are three obvious cracks on the south wall under the highest smokestack.

This is the beginning of pitch 1. Climb up a short corner to a ledge and then up a second corner with a BD #4 sized crack at your right and finger/ring locks on your left. Exit either climber's right to a rappel station or climber's left along a loose slab to a separate rappel station. Note that the station at climber's left will be easier to belay from, but is trickier to exit out of from P1.\n\nP2 starts roughly below the rappel station at climber's left. Mantle up to a ledge and then pick from a an off-width chimney at climber's right, a wavy offset hand to finger sized crack directly above the station or hands to off-width crack at climber's left. Climb until just below the head wall of the summit block and setup a gear anchor.\n\nP3 goes around the summit head wall at climber's right. Step out onto an exposed ledge and then up a short, but vertical fist-sized crack to flat edge. There is also a hand-sized crack running in parallel just climber's right. Pull up of the edge and up low angle slab to reach the summit block. Mantle the summit boulder at the top once you're second is up.\n\nDetailed report here:  francisbaileyh.com/2022/09/…\n\n\nGear anchors"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"UyQawwDKWWmMV0V+Bf4PDw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.93931,49.93249]}},"createdBy":"/NMZNdaKUziLr/j7gOFWpQ==","_change":{"user":"/NMZNdaKUziLr/j7gOFWpQ==","historyId":"64141409f0cf0083295f98fe","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:17:29.624Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,e552f824-165c-58f7-8102-f3bab4832c0a,76f8431d-1c56-50a1-8491-29b6cbc46062,53241ac3-00ca-5969-8c57-457e05fe0f0f","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Sea to Sky (Squamish to Whistler)","Garibaldi Park","Phyllis' Engine"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.93931,49.93249]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"UyQawwDKWWmMV0V+Bf4PDw=="},"content":{"description":"A peculiar feature along the ridge between Mt Carr and Castle Towers, comprised of a series of granite spires"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64141409f0cf0083295f98fe","prevHistoryId":"64141409f0cf0083295f98f4","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T07:17:26.926Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T07:17:29.632Z","updatedBy":"cA+doI87XbWNiXhFufH+Vw=="}
