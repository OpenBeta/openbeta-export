Wells main wall. P1 is 5.7. P2 is 5.8 with a 5.9 variation that goes up the slab to the tree anchor. P3 is 5.9R possibly X due to very poor opportunity for pro. The first pitch is rated 5.7 but the very first move is a 10a mantle that's only protected by a piton below your feet. Don't blow it. After that it's 5.4 climbing till you get to the bolted slab. After the slab, keep climbing past the red-ish mussey hooks and go 20ft higher to a very large ledge with an anchor and rap rings. Belay from here for P2. P2 is the money pitch for this route with some fun moves and great pro. The slab portion above is well-bolted and also very fun. P3 looks like a minefield of runout choss.Â \n\n\n\nMt. Wells right side of main wall. Ascend a static line up a 15ft 5.6 ledge to gain the first belay stance.\n\nBolted anchor on every pitch. Mostly trad with a few bolts in the right spots."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"hvXimi77UZGrD7vtLWWv4w==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.55712,48.43858]}},"createdBy":"zU3HxEdVXKmJ5P4ohPCCWw==","_change":{"user":"zU3HxEdVXKmJ5P4ohPCCWw==","historyId":"641422daf0cf008329604194","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:20:42.455Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,e7eb252c-5158-5629-9b63-6baf3ba04e68,d4deda9c-f516-5566-a4b2-1977ce084a22,dac7352d-1a56-5936-9e30-7797f1353dd4,8adf9b29-6c7f-5882-ae3e-eaefe522b3d6,86f5e29a-2efb-5191-ab0f-bbed2d65afe3","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Vancouver Island","Victoria","Mt Wells","Main Walls","Nature Calls Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.55712,48.43858]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"hvXimi77UZGrD7vtLWWv4w=="},"content":{"description":"Shady and cool most of the time."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641422daf0cf008329604194","prevHistoryId":"641422d9f0cf00832960418e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:20:40.137Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:20:42.466Z","updatedBy":"zU3HxEdVXKmJ5P4ohPCCWw=="}
