Rock is generally solid, but could use some cleaning in some spots. All but two of the routes are fully bolted. Great for doing long, moderate sport climbs up to 40-45 meters. Two pitches bring many of the routes to the top of the wall, which you can walk off. At the top you get beautiful views of the Olympic range and Sooke basin. The first pitch of many of these climbs is in the 40m range, so having two ropes with you is smart if you're not planning on topping out.
