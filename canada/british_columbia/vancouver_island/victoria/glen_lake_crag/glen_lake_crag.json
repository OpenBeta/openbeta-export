The view from the top, back towards Victoria, is spectacular. The rock is good quality weathered basalt – lots of friction and many edges and flakes. It is located 5 minutes’ drive from the Westshore Town Centre in Langford, or 15-20-minute drive from downtown Victoria."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64152e39135731b69111e92f","prevHistoryId":"64152e33135731b69111e923","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:19:28.777Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:11.472Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
