All the hands are juggy and the moves are very fun. Great stances for placing pro but can be a bit run out for a new trad leader. You can't really stitch it up. Just go slow and unlock the jugs and steps. The trickiest part of this climb is getting started and getting the first piece set then getting above the pod. After only doing this once I felt like the committing move over the pod was probably 5.9-ish but I likely was doing something unnecessary or off-route (as usual).\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the main wall. There's a pod (void) in the wall about 5 feet off the ground that is big enough to hold a person and you start under this and climb right and around the pod to start the line.
