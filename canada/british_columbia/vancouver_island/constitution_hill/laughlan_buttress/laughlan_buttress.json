Pitch 1 (5.8) climbs a nice corner crack and to the left to anchors shared with La Guillotine. Pitch 2 (10a) climbs changing corners and cracks to an anchor right of the horn. Pitch 3 (5.9) Cracks and blocks to the base of the wide corner crack. Pitch 4 (10b) Up the corner system with some wide sections and left out the imposing roof (35m). It's possible to do two variations: First is thinner cracks to the right to start and join the main line passing a rappel anchor (no grade difference). Second is exit the roof by going right instead of left and find a hidden finger crack to the anchor (10+). Pitch 4 (10+) ramble up the low angle runout slab to the obvious crack up the final headwall. A couple strenuous moves (easier for the tall) gets you to an easy hand crack.\n\n\n\nThe beautiful belay platform out of stacked rocks.\n\nA large rack. For pitch four it's good to have doubles of #1-3 and some may want a 4.5 or 5 for the wide section though it is not unsafe without. Bolted rappel ring belays.  Use all anchors to rappel with a 60m rope."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"pdp8sRvnW16YDYJ16JLiAw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-125.19649,49.7882]}},"createdBy":"0loG7K+HXz+pFHnAgTr69g==","_change":{"user":"0loG7K+HXz+pFHnAgTr69g==","historyId":"64142125f0cf008329602fdd","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:13:26.006Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,e7eb252c-5158-5629-9b63-6baf3ba04e68,112ba75e-c284-5e80-b08f-901219cfaa14,a5da7cb1-1be7-5b5e-980d-8275e892e203","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Vancouver Island","Constitution Hill","Laughlan Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-125.19649,49.7882]},"bbox":[-125.19718648350471,49.78775033981813,-125.19579351649526,49.788649660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"pdp8sRvnW16YDYJ16JLiAw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-125.19718648350471,49.78775033981813],[-125.19579351649526,49.78775033981813],[-125.19579351649526,49.788649660181854],[-125.19718648350471,49.788649660181854],[-125.19718648350471,49.78775033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"A steep ridge of rock visible from the road extending from the talus all the way to the top of the main bluffs"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142125f0cf008329602fdd","prevHistoryId":"64142125f0cf008329602fd7","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:13:24.082Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:05.052Z","updatedBy":"0loG7K+HXz+pFHnAgTr69g=="}
