You start your approach by walking the trail through two large square boulders. From there you continue to a gravel stream bed, don't follow that, the trail is straight up and is immediately apparent when you find it, as it is well constructed and well maintained. You will come to a fork in the trail and take the left option. The approach trails in this area are amazing. You will pass by the base of Small Walls and then arrive at the base of Ahren's Rock (marked by a sign). The first sport route (5.6) is to the right of a little wooden stair."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142258f0cf008329603b82","prevHistoryId":"64142257f0cf008329603b78","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:18:29.540Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:18:32.259Z","updatedBy":"kPLwCaxFWyq/52SRszMUzQ=="}
