It is located in the centre of Vancouver Island and protects about 250,000 hectares. \n  \n The climbing in Strathcona Park is excellent and ranges from the limestone cliffs of Marblerock Canyon to the dramatic alpine walls of Mt Colonel Foster. Because most of the park is designated as 'Wilderness Conservation' no bolting is permitted by the BC Park Act. But that's fine because all the climbing routes established to date have been climbed with clean (trad) protection."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142267f0cf008329603c0d","prevHistoryId":"64142265f0cf008329603bfc","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:17:32.228Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:13.405Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
