The range is home to what at least were the largest remaining glaciers on Vancouver Island. T \n  \n he range runs in a single arcing ridge system bounding the Nomash River valley to its southwest and the the Kaipit and Woss Lake watersheds to the northeast. The jagged spires along the main ridge offer some superb alpine climbing and the lower glacier shelves have superb high terrain for ski touring including some long aesthetic descent lines. \n  \n The part of the range to the north of the height of land i.e.: the Woss Lake side including the glacier shelves, is within Woss Lake Provincial Park. The faces to the west i.e.: above the Nomash River, fall outside the park boundary."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142153f0cf0083296031e5","prevHistoryId":"64142152f0cf0083296031df","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:14:09.219Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:16.768Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
