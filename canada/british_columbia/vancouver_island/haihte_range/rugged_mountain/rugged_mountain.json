The anchors facilitate safety and the ability to retreat but the protection bolts are not common, 95% or more of the gear is natural and the climbing is definitely alpine in nature and can be run-out at times).\nThis route is approached the same as the regular SW Face route on Rugged. In the process of putting the route up the trail was cleared and improved the trail heading into the face significantly. Scramble the slabs which take you to the large ledge at the base of the route proper.\n\nP1 - 5.6/Low 5th (58M) Once reaching the ledge above the approach slabs the route starts immediately above and slightly to the left, a rightward trending crack marks the beginning. Climb the groove above continuing right until you can pass the bulge on the right. Head back left on slabs until you reach the first belay. The first pitch can be avoided by climbing the obvious leftward trending ramp you come to as you reach the large ledge above the approach slabs (this option is incredibly long, perhaps 65M and will require brief simul-climbing).\nP2 -Â 5.6 (55M) A few steep steps get you established on the second pitch which then trends up and left past two bolts. Continue up through a small bulge until you can step back right into the easier groove. A large ledge houses the 2nd belay.\nP3 - Low 5th (45M) An obvious leftward trending ramp leads up to the 3rd belay.\nP4 - 5.6 (55M) Ascend the right-facing corner until you reach a large ledge. Head up and establish yourself in the large left trending crack. A final steep move leads to another belay ledge.\nP5 - 5.7 (60M+) A very long pitch, may require brief simul-climbing for the leader to reach the anchor above unless you have 70M ropes, our 60M ropes just made it! Climb the awesome crack to the right of the belay ledge. Continue in the corner feature above until you can step left and breach the small overlap. Continue up the grooves above until you reach the ledge and belay.\nP6 - 4th (40M) Head right on the ledge until you reach another belay.\nP7 - 5.6 (60M+) Another rope stretcher, more potential simul-climbing! Head up and then right toward the flakes. Climb above the flakes until another bolt is discovered. Head up and left until reaching a ledge, follow the ledge left until you reach a belay. (You can rappel directly down to the anchor at the top of the 5th pitch from here, a long rappel, watch the ends of your rope!)\nP8 - 5.5 (45M) Climb above the anchor until you can clip a bolt. Head up the groove if dry or on the blunt arete to the left until you can head back up and right through the broken ground to the belay below the steep rock which breaks the wall at this point.\nP9 - 5.8 (55M) Head up the corner which breaches the steep wall (Thank you climbing gods) until a grassy ledge is reached. Keep heading upward on ledges until you have to squeeze yourself through some cedars. Above the cedars is a small chimney flake, clip the bolt and get above the chimney. Finish the pitch with some moderately crappy heather climbing until a large ledge and belay are found.\nP10 - 5.7 (57M) Climb up into the large groove above and right of the belay. Follow the groove until it starts becoming steep and dirty, look left for a bolt and climb the steep but fun rock out of the groove. Quest upwards until you reach a ledge and clip another bolt. Keep following occasional cracks until a belay is reached below a bulge.\nP11 - 5.6 (57M) Head up left to the weakness which breaks the bulge. Small slabs are broken by small ledges, a bolt is to be found at about half-pitch. A belay appears in a sea of stone on a little ledge.\nP12 - 5.6 (60M) Another rope stretcher! Lots of easy climbing with little pro to begin this pitch. Steeper terrain near the end with a little sting in the tail.\nP13 - 4th (30M) A shortish pitch which heads up and left around the steep rock wall above the belay. Get a piece of pro and then take a walk around the bushes out left until you can scramble up onto the low-angled heather ledges above. A bivy for at least 3 and potentially water can be found on a spacious ledge system down to climber's left from the belay at the top of this pitch.\nP14 - Low 5th (55M) Climb the nice slabby rock above the anchor until you're forced to head up on heather ledges. Climb the short rock wall until you can tunnel upwards through some cedar bushes. Keep heading up until you can re-establish yourself on a belay ledge below the steepening rock.\nP15 - 5.8 (55M) Climb above the anchor until you clip a bolt, above another is found. Step out right and then up to clip a third bolt. At this point head leftwards and up eventually reaching a heather covered ledge. Head right on the ledge until you find a further two bolts leading up a steep corner feature. Above a ledge is reached, up and right around the bulge to find the anchor.\nP16 - 5.8 (45M) Head up and left above the anchor climbing the large open corner. On the ledge above head back up and right in the obvious corner system. Belay above on the exposed pinnacle.\nP17 - 5.8 (25M) Climb the awkwardly leaning corner up to the anchor below the very steep flake system.\nP18 - 5.10 (25M) Pull the strenuous moves on the flake above the anchor (or pull on the bolts) to surmount the initial steepness, above the difficulties relent and a few more bolts protect the last few moves into an interesting belay nestled inside a large chimney system.\nP19 - 5.6 (45M) Climb above the anchor and clip a bolt, step out right into an outragously exposed position above the valley below. Ascend the ramp on amazing holds until you must step up and over a dwarf tree. Continue along a ledge until a weekness presents itself on your left. Belay above a short step.\nP20 - 5.7 (50M) Head up and right around the wall above the anchor. The wall which faces the inside of the large gully has an amazing crack system which gradually diagonals up to the crest of the ridge. Step over the ridge crest and continue along the fin of rock. Belay at the large horn where the fin attaches back to the main part of the mountain. Rope drag will be an issue.\nP21 - 5.10 (45M) Drop into and cross the gully. Head up the large right facing corner until reaching a ledge. Make some moves back right until a bolt can be found heading back left. Clip another bolt further left and climb onto the ledge above. Climb up the groove at the left side of the ledge stepping up and left onto another ledge. Up and right on easier ground until you can once again head back left to the ridge crest. Go around the ridge crest and belay.\nP22 - 5.6 (40M) Head out left on the large ledge. Find some pro and head up towards the chimney which can be seen above. Once above there are horns which can be slung to create a belay. The summit can be easily reached by heading up and right.\nThe route tops out just below where the Walsh-Facer-Hutchinson Route arrives below the summit tower. We headed in to the route with only approach shoes and were able to descend the WFH and get back to Nathan Col without touching any snow, this is condition dependant of course but should be possible in most years from mid-summer onwards.\n\nLook for a trending up and left ramp system at the start. Hopefully future parties continue to build cairns at the base. As of 2019 fall there was a water bottle sitting at the start of the route (likely gone now).\nBolted anchors, occasional bolts, gear (Single Rack)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"1vFtrpf6UIu2hSQfyhvF+Q==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-126.67786,50.03417]}},"createdBy":"xa7KKmWuVj6zAUDhlSkxaw==","_change":{"user":"xa7KKmWuVj6zAUDhlSkxaw==","historyId":"64142155f0cf0083296031f6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:14:13.543Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,e7eb252c-5158-5629-9b63-6baf3ba04e68,3010381c-4a95-503f-9f0c-58ac15ef05bc,d6f16dae-97fa-508b-b685-241fca1bc5f9","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Vancouver Island","Haihte Range","Rugged Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-126.67786,50.03417]},"bbox":[-126.67856004473093,50.03372033981814,-126.67715995526906,50.034619660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"1vFtrpf6UIu2hSQfyhvF+Q=="},"content":{"description":"Rugged Mountain is the high point of the Haihte Range and a beautiful and challenging summit to climb."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142155f0cf0083296031f6","prevHistoryId":"64142154f0cf0083296031f0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:14:11.251Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:15.744Z","updatedBy":"i16Gs10SUg6EiEQs+KHEIg=="}
