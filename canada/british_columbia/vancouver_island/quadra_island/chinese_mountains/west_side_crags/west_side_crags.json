They are spread out across a triangular-shaped hillside of open, mossy and patchy forested terrain. These crags are the more moderate of the crags at Chinese Mountains, almost all the routes are between 15 and 25m (with a few exceptions) and the crags have good base areas for hanging out and relatively easy access to the top anchors."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641421cbf0cf0083296036e8","prevHistoryId":"641421c4f0cf008329603691","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:16:01.768Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:16:02.830Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
