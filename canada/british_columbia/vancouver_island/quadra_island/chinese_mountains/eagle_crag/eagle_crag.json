The crag is about 60m high and most of the climbs are full rope length pitches or divided into 2 or 3 shorter pitches by natural ledges and breaks. The views from the climbs and especially from the top are outstanding, overlooking the southern peninsula of Quadra Island with the ocean on each side and the mountain ranges of Vancouver Island to the west and mainland BC to the east. \n  \n The crag is a fairly wide and complex feature with several sections and adjacent crags. Pay special attention to the descriptions and guidebook photo-topes to navigate around the complex and find the climbs. Be sure to note the pitch lengths and descent details for each route too."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414218cf0cf008329603447","prevHistoryId":"6414218af0cf008329603440","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:15:04.715Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:15:06.575Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
