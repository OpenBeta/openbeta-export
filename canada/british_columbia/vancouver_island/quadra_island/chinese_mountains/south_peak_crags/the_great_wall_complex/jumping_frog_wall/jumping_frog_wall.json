The rock is clean and steep with very interesting texture. The routes are quite sporty for what turned out to be the norm for Chinese Mountains in terms of bolt gaps and anchor setup but this suits the high quality of the routes and the positive if strenuous nature of the climbing. \n  \n Note that the top anchors can only be reached by hiking high up to the South Peak lookout and making 2 rappels (25m &amp; 15m) down to the anchors. Making this a better wall for leading than setting top ropes. Still, it can be done and the rappels are off bolted rap-ring anchors. To reach the top scramble up the 3rd class ledges to the right of the wall, pass the top anchors of the East Wall and continue uphill on wide ledges to join the main trail near the lookout. Find the first anchor just 10m down the mossy ledges from where the trail enters the open lookout area. \n  \n Jumping Frog does tend to seep after heavy rain and it takes a little extra time to dry out at the start of the season. But that also keeps the rock very clean so when the season is in full swing it's one of the best crags to visit. \n  \n Similar in character and pairs well with nearby Leaning Tree Edge."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641421acf0cf00832960357f","prevHistoryId":"641421acf0cf008329603575","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:15:36.801Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:15:40.781Z","updatedBy":"i16Gs10SUg6EiEQs+KHEIg=="}
