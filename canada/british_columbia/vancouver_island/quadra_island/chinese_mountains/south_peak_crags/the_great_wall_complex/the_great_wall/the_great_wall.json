Climb the ramp to avoid a roof in the dark, black rock. Step up over an overlap to a ledge and follow the ledge left to the base of a shallow corner system. Climb up the corner trending left to a few steep moves (10a) and up to the belay ledge. \n P2 - 10a - Club from the belay up a short corner, move left into another short corner and pull up onto a ledge. Gain a beautiful crack in the upper wall and finish up this to the top anchor.\n\nTo descend, either scramble up, trending right a bit toward the hiker's lookout and then walk off to the left. Or descend with 2 rappels.\nall bolts"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"v+ARH3pMXum2mWvY3gGPig==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-125.26302,50.14136]}},"createdBy":"i16Gs10SUg6EiEQs+KHEIg==","_change":{"user":"i16Gs10SUg6EiEQs+KHEIg==","historyId":"641421a7f0cf008329603550","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:15:35.969Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,853ee9cb-d5b0-5376-8a2a-1958675243b4,e7eb252c-5158-5629-9b63-6baf3ba04e68,4284c181-e9a8-59cb-8190-bd73ef28fa44,f31703ff-d9b5-5ea5-ae43-207254767de1,8b971d70-81b9-5034-a585-d5cd43cda692,85d43dcb-368c-5351-abb9-c15a87d7f929,bfe0111f-7a4c-5ee9-b699-6bd8de018f8a","pathTokens":["Canada","British Columbia","Vancouver Island","Quadra Island","Chinese Mountains","South Peak Crags","The Great Wall Complex","The Great Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-125.26302,50.14136]},"bbox":[-125.26372161213631,50.14091033981814,-125.26231838786369,50.14180966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"v+ARH3pMXum2mWvY3gGPig==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-125.26372161213631,50.14091033981814],[-125.26231838786369,50.14091033981814],[-125.26231838786369,50.14180966018186],[-125.26372161213631,50.14180966018186],[-125.26372161213631,50.14091033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"The Great Wall proper is the dominant feature of the overall Great Wall complex and has the longest climbing routes amongst the South Peak Crags at around 50m (2 pitches).
