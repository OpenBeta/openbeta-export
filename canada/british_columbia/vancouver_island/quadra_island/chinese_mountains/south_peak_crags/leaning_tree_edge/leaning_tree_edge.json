Start behind the leaning tree up steep, clean grey rock to the left of a boulder-pinnacle to a thin crack in a left facing corner on a semi-detached (but solid) block. Climb over the block into a shallow corner on good holds to mantle onto a narrow black ledge halfway up. Step left on the ledge and then continue direct alongside the tree up a steep, grinding wall.
