Like most of the terrain in the central and north island, Quadra is a rugged, hilly island and has a good collection of clean, south-facing rock outcrops that have some outstanding developed sport climbing routes. At present (summer 2017) there are over 200 listed climbing routes on Quadra, most of them high-quality, 1, 2 and 3 pitch sport routes making it one of the best developed cragging areas in the region. \n  \n The rock is a volcanic basalt called Andesite, it differs from the typical Karmutzen basalts found at Crest Creek and Comox Lake and has arguably a more user-friendly texture and character than any of the neighbouring crag areas. Routes are generally steep with positive holds, superb friction from numerous pea-sized pyroclastic crystals and quite clean due to the open exposure. \n  \n What really makes Quadra Island an exceptional place to climb is the atmosphere and ambiance at the crags. The bluffs are mostly perched high up on a south-facing hillside with sweeping views of the southern part of the island, the shimmering Salish Sea and two ranges of snow-capped mountains running into the distance. From many of the crags the Vancouver Island Alps are in plain site all the way from Mt Arrowsmith to Mt Cain! \n  \n The Quadra Island community really makes this a perfect climbing destination too with great accommodation options from tent camping by the beach, family-run B&amp;Bs, luxury resorts and everything in between. There are lots of other outdoor activities too including a superb network of mountain bike trails, wonderful hiking trails, world-class diving, wildlife viewing and pretty much any sort of marine or mountain activity you can imagine.  \n  \n A detailed guidebook is available here:  wildisle.ca/quadrarockclimbs/"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641421d0f0cf00832960372e","prevHistoryId":"64142185f0cf008329603424","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:14:59.263Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:20.697Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
