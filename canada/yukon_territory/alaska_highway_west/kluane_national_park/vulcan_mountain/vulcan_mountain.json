Nothing to gnarly. We took far climber's right up the main face, near the rocks to gain access to the upper ridge. We did not encounter any major crevasses  on the 1st week of July on a good snow year but could see some sags on the face so keep your head up! This mountain doesn't get climbed a lot so each party will have to make their own decisions about how to climb it. Once on the upper ridge, enjoy a short but exposed walk to the summit, this is where some parties might feel a little exposed. \n\nSnow Pickets if needed"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"91NoLr6zXXWCX0cjQEqXyw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-138.46529,60.88936]}},"createdBy":"MBDYJW0WUFaPKkcvqoe3pQ==","_change":{"user":"MBDYJW0WUFaPKkcvqoe3pQ==","historyId":"6414a295135731b69111818e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:25:41.320Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,3396badc-1a81-5a16-b36a-867161b949cd,71a962f3-cc38-5796-a1f9-3f9ece708892,06fa8ce8-2216-57fd-a6d9-34b1f8c1a98b,f753682e-beb3-5d75-825f-4723404a97cb","pathTokens":["Canada","Yukon Territory","Alaska Highway West","Kluane National Park","Vulcan Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-138.46529,60.88936]},"bbox":[-138.46621428030525,60.888910339818146,-138.46436571969477,60.889809660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"91NoLr6zXXWCX0cjQEqXyw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-138.46621428030525,60.888910339818146],[-138.46436571969477,60.888910339818146],[-138.46436571969477,60.889809660181875],[-138.46621428030525,60.889809660181875],[-138.46621428030525,60.888910339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":"When we first heard about Vulcan Mountain, we looked it up online and could only find one vague ACC trip report from the 70s that stated it was an old mountaineering objective so we decided to share some beta. Located in Kluane National Park, this mountain is a great moderate snow/glacier mountaineering objective. The steepest portions felt around 45-50 degrees of snow climbing and although, most of the climb is fairly non-technical. Parties should be comfortable with walking with exposure as a misstep on the summit ridge would result in a seriously long fall that would be difficult to self-arrest. Some people may feel more secure with a few snow anchors and belays especially on the down climb.  \n  \n Note: most of this route is in Kluane National Park so check in with Parks Canada prior to climbing.  \n  \n Gear Required:  \n Glacier Travel Gear  \n Snow Pickets 1-2   \n Crampons  \n Mountain Axe"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a295135731b69111818e","prevHistoryId":"6414a294135731b691118188","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:25:39.028Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:37.049Z","updatedBy":"MBDYJW0WUFaPKkcvqoe3pQ=="}
