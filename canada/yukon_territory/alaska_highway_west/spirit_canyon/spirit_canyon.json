On the edge of the Sifton range, the Ibex Valley and with Mt. Ingram dominating the southern view, this rich area overlooking an old burn is host to elk, eagles, harriers and peregrine falcons just to name a few. There is a long native history associated with this canyon, so treat it accordingly. Please do not interfere with the wildlife or nesting areas of the eagles and falcons, they will not survive with too much human interference."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","historyId":"6414a30b135731b69111852d","prevHistoryId":"6414a309135731b691118522","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:27:37.203Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:37.230Z","updatedBy":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg=="}
