It's true what they say, there are a handfull of fully equiped sport routes here ranging from 5.8 - 5.13; most of which, are in the 5.11-5.12 range. Some are steep jug hauls similar to what you find at Red River Gorge. The hard ones are thin slab mind-bottlers (when your brain gets stuck in a bottle).   \n  \n There are lots of places for FA's and trad multi-pitch repeats along the shoreline. Trad teams will find decent limestone cracks to plug gear in wherever they  can conceive. Rumors say that mythic 6-pitch trad routes exist at the north end of the lake, near the mouth of the Yukon River"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","historyId":"6414a34a135731b691118768","prevHistoryId":"6414a349135731b69111875d","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:28:41.867Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:37.387Z","updatedBy":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg=="}
