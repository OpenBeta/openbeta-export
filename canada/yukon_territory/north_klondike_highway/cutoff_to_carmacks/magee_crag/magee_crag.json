There are some trees and apparently anchors on the top of the cliff. Â In my visit I did not see the anchors, but am told they are there. As far as I could tell there are no sport routes so it seems primarily an area for top roping.\n\nAccess is fairly easy following the dirt road and along the fence to the base of the cliff"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"NNyI5Y61UJeDfQGFmJ+Vyg==","historyId":"6414a34c135731b691118779","prevHistoryId":"6414a34b135731b69111876e","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:28:43.365Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:40.857Z","updatedBy":"NNyI5Y61UJeDfQGFmJ+Vyg=="}
