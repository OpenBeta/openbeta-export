Similar to provinces, the territories are their own political jurisdictions. \n  \n From a climbing perspective, the Yukon is most famously the home of Mt. Logan, the highest peak in Canada. \n  \n \"If you are developing a new crag, do some homework. Large parts of  \n land fall under First Nations Land Claims agreements and may be  \n subject to special regulations or considerations. Using land for  \n recreational purposes is allowed under most Land Claims agreements,  \n however modifications to the land such as bolting and cutting trails  \n is usually controlled. Failure to comply with Land Claims agreements  \n could lead to closure of the crag. If you have any questions about a  \n particular area or crag let us know at climbyukon.net and weÂ’ll do our  \n best to answer.\"  \n From the first edition of Ryan Agar's guide book to the area: Yukon Climbing Guide."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a493135731b6911190d6","prevHistoryId":"6414a3e3135731b691118bf9","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:21.618Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:21.002Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
