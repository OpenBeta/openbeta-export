From here head right to a really awesome jug. Place small gear here. Head up on slopey holds that are better when laybacked. First crux is making it to the next massive jug. Bad crimp and some fancy footwork will get you there. Mantel up to the no-hands rest. Catch your breath. \n Next is the three cruxes. Head up and left a bit. I match to get through this section. Now you have to reach up and slot your hand in the left crack. This is a semi-jam and semi-layback. Right foot out left and reach WAAAY up. Slopey hold, but again, a layback will make this feel more secure. You can get a 0.75 BD cam in here. \n Next is again a small crimp you can layback with a right foot out left. Again, reach WAAAY up to a shark fin, and another slopy hold above. Fist jam and then place another 0.75. Breath. \n Final crux! Pinch the giant block and reach WAAAY UP (see a theme?).
