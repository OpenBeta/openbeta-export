Some go there to shoot their guns in the firing range, others get buried in the cemetery (no causal relationship there). Some bring their first dates on the top of the mountain to do some platonic star-gazing. Many go mountain biking there, and a lucky few get some fun climbing on the chunks of limestone interspersed on its South-West face. \n  \n There is tons of potential for development. At present two climbing areas are frequented: Back Alley and Solar Shot (formerly called Hidden View)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a4c2135731b691119343","prevHistoryId":"6414a4be135731b691119314","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:34:43.153Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:34:44.246Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
