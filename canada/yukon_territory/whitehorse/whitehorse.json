Capital of the Yukon. \n\nDespite most cliffs being small and hidden amongst the surrounding forest, there is great access to a half dozen well-developed crags within a 15 minutes (or less) of downtown. Like much of the Yukon, there is rock of all kinds. Limestone, basalt, granite, greywacke are all present here with still more potential for development.Â \n\nIf looking for multipitch or adventure climbing you're a short drive from White Mountain (1 hr), Paint Mountain (1 hr, 40 mins), or Carcross (1 hr)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a50b135731b6911196bb","prevHistoryId":"6414a506135731b691119682","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":9,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:34:11.981Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:34:13.115Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
