Fairly secluded. Great granite and seriously beautiful views down the canyon.\n\nGolden Canyon is located on First Nation settlement land. The First Nation has expressed concern about increased traffic on their settlement land. Please consider climbing in smaller groups and absolutely ensure that you pack out any waste. Consider heading in for day trips and refraining from camping at the site near the entrance of the canyon. If you wish to camp in the area, there are maintained sites available along the trans-Canada trail. To get there, continue along the road where you parked by the start of the walking trail, and you'll see the campsites eventually on your left.\n\n\"If you are developing a new crag, do some homework. Large parts of land fall under First Nations Land Claims agreements and may be subject to special regulations or considerations. Using land for recreational purposes is allowed under most Land Claims agreements, however modifications to the land such as bolting and cutting trails is usually controlled. Failure to comply with Land Claims agreements could lead to closure of the crag. If you have any questions about a particular area or crag let us know at climbyukon.net and we'll do our best to answer.\"\nFrom the first edition of Ryan Agar's guide book to the area: Yukon Climbing Guide.\n\nClimbing access inquiries can also be directed to climbingaccess.yt@gmail.com"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a450135731b691118f23","prevHistoryId":"6414a44d135731b691118f08","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:32:25.853Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:30.265Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
