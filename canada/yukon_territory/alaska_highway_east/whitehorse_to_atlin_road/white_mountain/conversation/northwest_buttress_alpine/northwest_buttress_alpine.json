This climb sees most travel early season before overhead hazards form (i.e. large cornice). It begins in a bowl, so be aware of avalanche potential. All this can be scouted from the road with a good pair of binoculars.\nThe first pitch can be a free ice pillar, snow pillar or a rock pitch. This leads up a ramp to the base of the WI3 pitch. Again this second pitch can take various forms. When its good, it's a fun 18m ice pitch. The next pitch leads up a chimney. There's a good chance ice will form here, but bring rock gear (including pins) just in case. This leads you to a ledge. From here the climbing is easy up to the top of the ridge if you please.\n\nIt's a bushwhack! Hike 40 minutes up towards Lover's Quarrel. When you are almost at the crag, a distinct gully splits climber's left. Head up this gully for a couple hours staying left. At times it's easier to be above and left of the gully. You'll have to make a choice based on snow conditions to A.) move back into the gully and up the snow bowl. Or B.) hike up left of the gully on a ridge which slowly brings you to the snow bowl.<br />Alternatively, people climb to the top of Kiss and Make-Up. Head climber's left and down one gully. Climb back up and out of this gully staying high. You will get to the snow bowl below Funga. Scout this route ahead of time to ensure you follow the tree line and avoid cliffs.\nBring all the fun alpine gear you have! Don't forget tat to rap from."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"WeI8acfPU06BI9EjkeGlgw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-133.91606,60.32815]}},"createdBy":"uiRHHU+LVieVfStGbKktIw==","_change":{"user":"uiRHHU+LVieVfStGbKktIw==","historyId":"6414a269135731b691117f8d","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:57.147Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,3396badc-1a81-5a16-b36a-867161b949cd,76778844-37f8-5745-8c1e-56e5ec5aefce,2f4c04c6-48dd-5ea1-816e-0128795dbeea,838d80e1-b9d5-5113-9893-4e30b3ade227,da24b127-3384-508f-8b18-8a19d4243c34,59e23c69-c7cf-534e-8123-d12391e1a583","pathTokens":["Canada","Yukon Territory","Alaska Highway East","Whitehorse to Atlin Road","White Mountain","Conversation","Northwest Buttress Alpine"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-133.91606,60.32815]},"bbox":[-133.91696834597786,60.327700339818136,-133.91515165402208,60.328599660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"WeI8acfPU06BI9EjkeGlgw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-133.91696834597786,60.327700339818136],[-133.91515165402208,60.327700339818136],[-133.91515165402208,60.328599660181865],[-133.91696834597786,60.328599660181865],[-133.91696834597786,60.327700339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"There are a number of alpine climbs in this area that are and are not reported.
