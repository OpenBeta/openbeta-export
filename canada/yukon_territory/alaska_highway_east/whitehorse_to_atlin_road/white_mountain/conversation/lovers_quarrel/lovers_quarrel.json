Many short pitches of ice, maybe 20. It is most Yukoner's first ice climb. Bring a short rope for a friend to follow, a 20-30m rope will do. Most pitches are under 4m, there are two longer pitches ~8m. If you're reading between the lines, many short pitches means bulges! You'll get lots of practice climbing through unpredictable bulges. So don't fall asleep as you're heading up.\nIt can shape up in October, so keep your eyes open and ask around if the ice is in. This climb needs some travel to thicken it up (open up any trapped water at the edges of the pools). If you're traveling up it for the first time, give yourself 2-3 hours to enjoy the beauty of the area. Once it settles out at the top, exit climber's right. You can hike down next to the ice canyon.\n\nAs per the description to Lover's Quarrel. The pillar (Lover's Quarrel) is the beginning of this long climb. However, you can start above it by following a path climber's right of the crag. Once you've hiked above the crag, there are two entry points to the ice. It's much easier to start this climb from the second entry point to the ice, ~30m above the cliffs of the crag. The path and ice almost converge at this point, but you'll need to climb down (it can be quite slick) to a nice ice platform.\nice screws, quick draws and 30m rope"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"6W5FVGK5VHOe+n+LHHoGsA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-133.92807,60.32933]}},"createdBy":"uiRHHU+LVieVfStGbKktIw==","_change":{"user":"uiRHHU+LVieVfStGbKktIw==","historyId":"6414a265135731b691117f5e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:53.238Z"},{"_id":"mkJjycp4R2+EACTOq9WgGw==","name":"Lover's Quarrel","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":true,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":true},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unsure","length":12,"content":{"description":"This ice pillar can be stout or skinny all depending on the autumn rain fall and traffic on the route above.

There are two obvious ones. The first entry point is protected by limestone slab, usually covered in snow. This one is directly above the pillar and can be very tricky (there are lots of trees to make an anchor from).
