The road side crag is sunny with a large amount of sport climbs (the most of any area in the Territory!). It consist of 3 Bolt Wonderland, Naked Grotto and Pika Palace. Please do not park on the highway as it is a short straight away and there is a pull out 30 meters up the road. Unload your car or drive into the ditch, but avoid parking on the road for everyone's safety. By Yukon standards, can become crowded. Beautifully sharp limestone.\n\nAlso check out the growing number of really cool slabby multi-pitch routes on Rusted Goat Wall. You'll park at the boat launch and plunge into the forest above. You'll meander through dense bush trying to aim your internal compass towards the Northern [of 2] red splotches on the mountain. You'll find some fun sport and trad multipitch. Be aware of loose rocks as this is the norm in the North with freeze thaw. Please try to stay away during lambing season (April 1-mid June). \n\nThe Northwest Buttress holds crumbly limestone, but good rock can be found. There are a number of summer ascents up it, just ask around. It primarily is a winter crag, Conversation, which is located up the Alaska Highway. There are dry tooling, ice and mixed routes for your pleasure."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a27e135731b6911180ba","prevHistoryId":"6414a278135731b691118059","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:32.713Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:34.110Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
