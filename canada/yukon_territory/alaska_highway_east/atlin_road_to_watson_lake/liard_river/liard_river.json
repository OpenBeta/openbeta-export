The base is only a couple of meters above the swiftly flowing Liard River. Though within an old burn area, this awesome location offers several rewarding climbs from the intermediate level to some very difficult routes. Wild and unused, it is still dirty with only a couple of routes known to be reasonably clean."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg==","historyId":"6414a24e135731b691117e59","prevHistoryId":"6414a24d135731b691117e4e","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:24:29.228Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:30.375Z","updatedBy":"iWAKJJDWXzGSKVgKaOyWxg=="}
