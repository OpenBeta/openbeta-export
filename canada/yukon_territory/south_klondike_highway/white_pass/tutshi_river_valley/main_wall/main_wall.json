Protection is okay until after the traverse, where it becomes quite run-out to the top of the first pitch. There is a solid crack just past the tree at the top of the first pitch on a good belay ledge that can be used to set up an anchor. The second pitch is quite short (~10m), and lets you access the huge tree (which is rooted in multiple places over a large area and has a large trunk) that you can rappel off of (you'll need two ropes for the rappel, it's approximately 40m). There is the potential to scramble off the top of the route from here.\n\nFirst ascent was on a double rack"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"poumW1+nUQCg1oakOyI2Cw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-134.84976,59.80478]}},"createdBy":"kFvTmiCCVxGpXJEfI9i0Pg==","_change":{"user":"kFvTmiCCVxGpXJEfI9i0Pg==","historyId":"6414a3b4135731b691118aac","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:30:28.226Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,3396badc-1a81-5a16-b36a-867161b949cd,83f867dd-18c8-5fa6-ba04-69b9c264c78e,b545a755-78db-5cdd-9a61-1815482e2e91,a8941fb4-9f31-5ab5-b352-c9e80706d9a8,a68ba65b-5fa7-5100-a0d6-86a43b22360b","pathTokens":["Canada","Yukon Territory","South Klondike Highway","White Pass","Tutshi River Valley","Main Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-134.84976,59.80478]},"bbox":[-134.85065404933266,59.80433033981814,-134.84886595066732,59.805229660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"poumW1+nUQCg1oakOyI2Cw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-134.85065404933266,59.80433033981814],[-134.84886595066732,59.80433033981814],[-134.84886595066732,59.805229660181865],[-134.85065404933266,59.805229660181865],[-134.85065404933266,59.80433033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"The main wall is largely unexplored at this time (if someone else knows more, please update), but has a potential for other routes.
