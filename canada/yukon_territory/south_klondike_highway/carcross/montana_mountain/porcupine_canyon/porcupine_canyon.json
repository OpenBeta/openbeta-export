It makes an\nexcellent place for lunch. Climbing routes have been cleaned but expect to find some loose rock especially in\nthe spring after a freeze / thaw cycle (dech’oge is particularly chossy).\nAll climbs are sport with anchors are paired decent rings. They are accessible for setting up ‘top ropes’, but a safety line might make you\nfeel more comfortable near the edge. This site was developed in the summer of 2012 under the guidance of\nthe Carcross Tagish First Nation and the ‘Trails to Success’ program."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a36b135731b691118890","prevHistoryId":"6414a367135731b691118861","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:29:09.771Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:30.389Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
