Good quality scrambling with a few low fifth class moves will lead you up and down the sawtooth spine of Matheson Ridge towards the summit. There are lots of route options throughout the ridge traverse - pick your favourite but be ready for a bit of exposure and plenty of downclimbing. \n\nThe crux is a 20m pitch that you likely will want to rappel on your way to the summit and climb with some protection on your way back. There is another short pitch that we solo-ed on the way to the summit but rappelled on the descent. \n\nFor the rappels, a 40m rope would be sufficient (we had a 50m rope and it was plenty). There were two obvious route options on the crux pitch during the descent - an easier face climb with sparse protection, or a more vertical crack climb to the left. We chose the former only passive protection - tricams, hexes and nuts, but a .5 cam could be useful. On the other hand, a single rack would take you up the crack on the left.\n\n\n\nThe Matheson Ridge climb is located on the main ridge that leads to Matheson summit from the south. Choose your way up one of two connector ridge lines (one approaches from the south, the other from the east) from your campsite and continue following the connector towards Matheson Ridge. You'll come across other ridges connecting to the main line - one of which connects to Montana ridge (that's the one we took in June 2020). Past that intersection, the climbing becomes more technical and route finding becomes a bit more intricate but FUN! Depth perception is tricky and you'll soon find out that Matheson Ridge is a true sawtooth - constant ups and downs with numerous false summits. Below are some photos of the interesting climbing you can find - lots of hand jams to be found as well as good down-climbing practice! \n\nThe peak is 5m higher than the sub-peak ;)\n\nArea may look bare for rappel anchor (and belay anchor) but some rocks can be slinged and backed up by a nut."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"d0NrMYibVFW+syzNDgpRGw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-134.72815,60.05032]}},"createdBy":"kRE4Ncf0UjyjuFHHUQ874w==","_change":{"user":"kRE4Ncf0UjyjuFHHUQ874w==","historyId":"6414a365135731b691118846","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:29:09.300Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,3396badc-1a81-5a16-b36a-867161b949cd,83f867dd-18c8-5fa6-ba04-69b9c264c78e,6dacd017-e398-53a4-8bf9-19ffe0ca8ddf,fb22badc-cd9a-55f3-a127-8fa4c56813f3,77436b31-889b-5455-beb3-2ccd0e0a511b","pathTokens":["Canada","Yukon Territory","South Klondike Highway","Carcross","Montana Mountain","Matheson Ridge"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-134.72815,60.05032]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"d0NrMYibVFW+syzNDgpRGw=="},"content":{"description":"The saw-blade like Matheson ridge and its peak offers a great day of technical climbing and down-climbing, great exposure and a 20m rappel/trad climb."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a365135731b691118846","prevHistoryId":"6414a363135731b691118840","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:29:05.381Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:29:09.308Z","updatedBy":"kRE4Ncf0UjyjuFHHUQ874w=="}
