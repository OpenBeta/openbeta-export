(80 ft)\n\nP3 (5.12b/c) : Climb the obvious finger crack to a low angle section, watch out for a loose block on your left. Traverse right using an horizontal crack and reestablish yourself up, on a detached flake. You can sling the top of the flake, then climb through a thin section to a stance. Get psyched, traverse left on the steep slabby corner, \"Le Mur de Prison (crux)\". Pass three (3) bolts and gain a crack that goes from finger to thin-hand.

Please, keep in touch if you have any feedback about grades. \n\nThe route can be all aid climbed at 5.4 A2+, so it would be super easy to go have a look on aid and work the free cruxes. It will probably goes around 5.13 (crux on gear), and so should be one of the hardest free lines on Cap Trinité, with a gear protected crux. The rock is absolutely stellar, with just one short section of orange crumbly rock.\n\nFirst part: Shared with Le Temps Libre\n\nP1: 5.10-, 30m.\n\nStart under a bolt and follow cleanest obvious crack system going diagonally right (5.6).\n\nP2: 5.10, 15m.\n\nStart at a shiny chained anchor just above the trail. 5.10 technical crux (well protected). From here go straight up then get around trees by the left on a superb half moon crack. A fixed line also reaches this belay from the ground so you could start from here with just walking.\n\nP3: 5.9+, 20m.\n\nGo slightly to the right and follow the clean cracks.\n\nP4: 5.10+, 20m.\n\nKeep following the finger crack to a superb finish. Crux is protected by a bolt. (Easily aided at 5.9 C2).\n\nSecond part: Le Temps Suspendu\n\nP5: 5.10 or 5.9 C2, 40m. (Tom Canac &amp; Hugo Drouin. 2019)\n\nGo up the bolted squeeze chimney. Some bolts should keep you mostly safe. Get up the slab and climb the left dihedral (bolt at the end). Pass the roof and go up the slab to the next anchor after the tree. Horrendous drag and terrible haul are to be planned.\n\nP6: \"La tour du pêcheur\" 5.12 (?) or 5.9 C2, 20m.  (Tom Canac &amp; Simon Bossé, 2022)\n\nFrom the anchor, go left and walk up the sidewalk to the little roof (one bolt). The crux haven't been freed on lead yet, but should go around 5.12. Then traverse the slab (bolt) to a beautiful straight up crack in crumbling rock. Pull the mantle, protect for your follower, and join the anchor on your right. The name of the pitch refers to the fisher towers. It may gives you some insight about the rock quality.\n\nFor information, the original route was going right at the start of the pitch and climbed some not so nice but sketchy terrain on the right, at a grade of tricky A2.\n\nP7: \"La Clémentine\" 5.13 (?) or C2, 40m. (Tom Canac solo, 2021)\n\nThe crux of the route. Moves of the crux have been isolated in top rope, but never freed. Get ready to climb in a very bouldery style, while placing nuts. Easily aided to throw a safe top rope. After a very hard first 15m, the grade drops to a very enjoyable 5.10+.\n\nP8: \"Le Layback\" 5.12 (?) or A2, 40m. (Tom Canac solo, 2021)\n\nGet up the obvious line. A bouldery bolted start (try not to fall on your belayer) leads you to a 5.12 glory layback. The end of the pitch should keep you on your toes. A bit easier but committing. One could hand haul a pecker and a hammer to tame the dragon (5.10/11 PG13?) .\n\nP9: 5.12 (?) A1, 40m. (Tom Canac solo, 2021. Tom Canac &amp; Simon Bossé for the free variation, 2022)\n\nTraverse the slab (bolt) to get to a 5.11 section. After the last bolt, you need to find gear before committing to the crux (5.12?). Micro offset nuts and a pecker should make it reasonable. Then blast up the finger crack to a couple of obvious traverses between the cracks. Last 10m of the route are glory hands, with incredible exposure.\n\nP9 aid start: Somewhere between scary A2 and reasonable A3. (Tom Canac solo, 2021)\n\nThe original start of the last pitch (as seen in the movie Le Temps Suspendu) is the aid start of P9. To get there, from the belay, start on the left, and get up the thin cracks to join the free line (check the picture to see the line). A string of bodyweight placements (hook, camhook) should keep you awake until you can place your first pecker and feel safer. You shouldn't be able to clip the free bolts from the aid line.\n\n\n\nTrad. Enough bolts are placed to make it safe for the leader, but be ready to use micro cams, micro nuts, and a pecker or two for protection. \n<ul><li>Triple cams from #.3 to #1 are recommended.</li><li>Doubles under #.3 and double from #1 to #3. No need for anything bigger.</li><li>Full rack of nuts.</li><li>Micros offset are crucial for the last pitch (DMM Peenuts fits well)</li><li>At least one pecker need to be placed as free climbing pro (on lead or placed and cleaned after your attempt). Bring #1/ #2/ #3 to see which fits the best?</li></ul>\nAll bolted anchors with rap rings.\n\n\nTo go down, the best option is to rap the line. Rap beta:\n<ul><li>The last 3 pitches of the route require double ropes to rap.</li><li>As of 2022, the 3 bolts anchor at the top of La Clémentine twists the hell out of the ropes. My bad, I placed the bolts thinking first about the portaledge anchor. A bolt should be added between two of the existing bolts, and the rap rings moved to this new one, to have closer rap points.</li><li>Reaching the base of \"La Clémentine\" is not very straightforward. The best option is to leave a fixed rope to pull on, but the first to rap could also just place pieces, and the second clean them (big swings).</li><li>You could do one long rap from the base of La Clémentine to the base of the bolted chimney. You could also do two short raps with one 70m rope (so no knots to get stuck in the trees).</li><li>Then it's single rope raps to the fixed lines.</li><li>To one 60m rap to the ground. Enjoy the trees, it's part of the experience.</li></ul>\n\nThis route have been climbed ground up solo, as a multi year aid project between 2019 and 2021. Big thanks to Hugo Drouin and the team from Le Temps Libre for the lower pitches. Le Temps Suspendu is fully open to both aid and free climbing. Pitons (peckers) are needed for both types of ascents. Please, keep fixed gear out of the cracks, and respect both styles. If descent sized nuts could be used one day in the pitons scars, the route should go clean, to prevent further rock damage.\n\nFree climbing variations have been established with Simon Bossé in 2022. As of September 2022, the route have not been freed.\n\nYou can find extensive beta on the original aid topo. Note that some pitches were a little bit different at the time. Also, the topo refers to a massive death block (right under La Clémentine). This block have been cleaned and is now deep in the Fjord. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.escaladequebec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Topo-Le-Temps-Suspendu.pdf\">Original topo of Le Temps Suspendu</a>\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"nxrF9C6JWx6LPY/XcloyDQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.33579,48.30087]}},"createdBy":"FpfS88b5VDGMsh1zBejyfw==","_change":{"user":"FpfS88b5VDGMsh1zBejyfw==","historyId":"6414918c135731b69110c0ca","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:13:00.950Z"},{"_id":"7CJlCOIcSgKEKuev8Z6Ppw==","name":"Les Grands Galets (Aid)","grades":{"yds":"5.9"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":true,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Léopold Nadeau, Claude Bérubé, Oct 1974","length":258,"content":{"description":"\nCap Trinité's classic.

We took a 7 days trip to climb the route and freed the whole route over 5 days, spending 3 nights on the wall. This is truly a masterpiece of hard trad climbing. Pretty much every pitch would be four stars if there were single pitches, except for P1. We felt like the grade were a little soft on the face climbing cruxes, but quite stiff on the hard crack sections.\n\nP1 (5.8 R): Climb a huge flake to a tree then to a groove and climb on a series of dirty terrasses following the path of lease resistance. It might not be a good idea to fall. Gain a tree with slings and a pin then mantle to a big flat ledge. (130 ft / 40 m)\n\nP2 (5.12d PG-13): Climb into the quintessential right facing corner using stemming. Pass two good pods, the lower one had a fixed cam into it. The meat of the whole route comes right after the second pod where the crack become a series of flaring pin scars that are too small for fingers. Pure stemming was the way we got through this section. There is a good rest after the crux with an intermediate anchor, right under a small roof. We didn't stop there to belay because for us it didn't make sense. Crank through the roof and follow the corner (finger) to the pendulum crux. At the pendulum anchor, reach left for a hidden hold on the other side of the arete, traverse left into the face to reach the left facing corner and down climb to an anchor. (115 ft / 35 m)\n\nP3 (5.10a G): Climb the handcrack in the corner with hands and tight hands. Reach some ledges with multiple anchors underneath a capped roof. We established our portaledge camp up there. It is sheltered from rockfall and can provide some protection from the elements. We had some issues with mouses and chipmunks eating our food at night so plan accordingly. (100 ft / 30 m)\n\nP4 (5.12a PG-13): Climb easy but runout terrain to reach a huge flake that takes good gear. Follow this until you can traverse left (crux) on face holds at a pin. This didn't felt too hard for the original rating of 5.12a. Clip more pins and a bolt passing a giant hollow flake to a short lieback section, often wet, to a semi-hanging belay underneath the \"Enduro Corner\". (100 ft / 30 m)\n\nP5 (5.11d G): This is what we called the \"Enduro Corner\" and AKA \"Grosse Douceur\". It starts with hands and tight hands and tapers to flaring fingers. This pitch felt quite hard for original rating of 5.11d and was really sustained. Maybe more like 12a/b. The pitch ends at a completely hanging belay with no stance out right. The topo from Stéphane Perron says that linking this pitch into the next one would be considered as hard as 5.13a. (100 ft / 30 m)\n\nP6 (5.12c PG-13): A somehow heady lead that will make you understand where the name \"Les Grands Galets\" came from. Regain the crack system and climb massive flakes with hands and thigh hands to a very well define crux where the crack disappear. On steeper terrain, use face holds and some welcomed bolts (left) to get through to some moderate climbing. The top section is guarded by a burly, but short roof crack that leads too another cave with 2 bolted belays. (100 ft / 30 m)\n\nP7 (5.12b PG-13): Another pitch that will make you understand the route naming. Step on the blocks, clip a rusty piton (KB) and mantle onto good but sandy foot holds. Clip a good bolt (we removed a super old sling here) and climb the corner on dicey gear until you reach the roof. Place gear and traverse underneath the roof (crux) using knee bars. Reestablish yourself in the corner above the roof and reach a semi-hanging 2-bolt anchor. (100 ft / 30 m)\n\nP8 (5.12a G): Lieback the short but burly corner (crux) on small gear until you can reach the arete and move left on easier ground. Traverse into a lower angle corner and climb this to reach the top of the cliff. This last corner can be wet which might make it feel harder. (100 ft / 30 m)\n\n\n\nThe climb start right behind the commemorative cross.\n\nIt is also possible to access it from the top by walking the trail that leads to the Statue. Follow the trail that lead to the Statue for like 45-60 mins to reach a fine trail that cut right (48.316119, -70.325518). Follow the flagged trail for 20-30 mins. When you reach the cliff edge follow it to your left until it is not possible. You will encounter exposed terrain protected by old fixed rope railings. The top of the climb is marked by a 2-bolts anchor with chain. Go down the mossy chimney.\n\n\nDoubles from micros to Camalot 3, triples of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 1, offset cams and micro to medium (regular &amp; offset) nuts\n\n\nThe route can easily be rapped with a 60 m rope, but you will have to use the scary tree on P1.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"nxrF9C6JWx6LPY/XcloyDQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.33579,48.30087]}},"createdBy":"xk6ExJS0Wgu7GUrt12wW7w==","_change":{"user":"xk6ExJS0Wgu7GUrt12wW7w==","historyId":"6414918e135731b69110c0de","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:13:02.089Z"},{"_id":"lpJEbFmnTzm8nP/2QIP+gA==","name":"Les Joyeux Lurons (5.11+ libre, 5.9A2 artif)","grades":{"yds":"5.9"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":true,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"François-Guy Thivierge","length":248,"content":{"description":"\nBelle voie mais un peux sale, apparemment c'est comme ça sur le Cap. \n\nP1 5.11+\nThe crux is one of the first moves.

A fixed line reaches this belay from the ground. \n\nP3: 5.9+, 20m. Go slightly to the right and follow the clean cracks. \n\nP4: 5.10+, 20m. Mostly straight up, crux is also protected by a bolt.\n\nP5: 5.11d, 30m. Full sport. Traverse the big chimney to the right and follow the bolts on the slab and then on the blocky moves (5.11d crux). Exit on a slab and keep following the bolts.\n\nP6: 5.8, 40m. Go up (pass to the right of the tree to reduce drag) and then delicate but easy traverse right (3 bolts). Lots off zigzag on this pitch (bring alpine draws) but route finding is easy, just follow cleanliness.\n\nP7: 5.10+, 35m. Full sport. Follow a vegetated section up and left until you reach the slab. Follow the bolts on hard slab (5.10+ / 5.11?)\n\nP8: 5.10+, 40m. Walk to the right on a large ledge, pass the fixed rope and continue farther to the right.

Longest rappel is 40m. Some rappels are in pendulum but clipping bolts on the way down will allow you to reach the belays.\n\n\n\nThere is a large section where trees go high on the wall, the route is just left of that.

On some day it can be pretty windy. Not very crowded. Exception of the Grand Galets route which may have a party or two on the week-ends.\nGood rock, some very strong gray granite and some orange rock which is a bit flaky on surface. Long routes: between 150 and 300 meters. Most of the free stuff is very hard with some moderate here and there. A lot of aid climbing. A portaledge may be useful on at least 3 routes.\nDue to the annual closures due to bugs or peregrine falcon nesting, most routes need cleaning every year so don't forget your brushes.\n\nSeason: After the peregrine falcon departure and after thevicious black flies and mosquito season, early August to September.
