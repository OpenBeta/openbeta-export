Starts with easy slab climbing for 15 metre to reach a small \"roof\"...  hard move to pass the roof to reach a nice crack \n  \n Make your way up the crack to reach the Tree at the summit...  The fun part of the route is actully at the very end.\n\nThe route is right above \" le rocher école\"...  make it to the base of the climb by climbing a route of the \"rocher école\" or use the slightly exposed path to the right of the \"rocher école\"... <br />  <br /> To locate the route:  Make it to the top of the rocher école. <br />  <br /> Look for the only obvious crack 15-20 meters aboves a slab... <br /> A nice big tree grows at the top of the route. <br />  <br /> Thats it\nGood protection at the roof.  A piton + many possibilities for protection and the crack is awesome. Bring small cams for the crack and nuts. <br />  <br /> Salb at the beginnning is runout but very easy (5.2)"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"mUCHPgPzUFy8a9Gwb7JNsg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.89777,45.02262]}},"createdBy":"8A2JN7ucUeSrH+3smqCcNg==","_change":{"user":"8A2JN7ucUeSrH+3smqCcNg==","historyId":"64149816135731b6911103d6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:40:54.046Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,2dde9bf9-577b-5f7f-ad93-79babfc891a6,77fb6591-ecb5-5ddb-89b8-8b92a90a7f38,16859923-09a9-5e08-845b-688a577ecc34,9940873e-03f3-505c-bc6b-d1b06fb24db2","pathTokens":["Canada","Quebec","Cantons-de-l'est","Mont Pinacle","Rocher école"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.89777,45.02262]},"bbox":[-71.89840616673168,45.022170339818146,-71.89713383326831,45.02306966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"mUCHPgPzUFy8a9Gwb7JNsg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.89840616673168,45.022170339818146],[-71.89713383326831,45.022170339818146],[-71.89713383326831,45.02306966018187],[-71.89840616673168,45.02306966018187],[-71.89840616673168,45.022170339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":"Enter a description of this area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149816135731b6911103d6","prevHistoryId":"64149814135731b6911103d0","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:40:50.344Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:30.073Z","updatedBy":"LVk4CyGzVUKlccwQYeAuDA=="}
