A relatively wide crack (hands/fist type of thing). You can either climb it as a pure crack (makes it a little harder) or use some face features. After a few pieces, you'll get to a sort of hub into the face that makes for a good rest. The downside being that you'll have a somewhat overhanging crack for the last few moves. This can be well protected before the move with a #3 so nothing too committing. Then you can mantle onto the slab where everyone is hanging out (and likely have to answer a few questions as to how/why you're popping out from below like that). \n\nIt would be excellent if it were longer.\n\nFrom the 2nd view point at the top of Trail #1 (where everyone is having a snack &amp; photo ops), when you look at the lake, it's basically directly underneath you. Go along the edge of the big slab on the right and eventually you'll find a trail going down. As you go down (the big slab is now above, on our left) you will eventually get to a big, detached flake that forms a ledge with the main wall, leading to a corner with a much larger ledge from which to belay.\nMostly larger stuff. Not very long, super easy to protect at also any point. Great intro into trad lead."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"uCPsMvZuVIOFz1LqkiqClw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.89739,45.02442]}},"createdBy":"kZrHudF0VY2EtWJfYPZZ9Q==","_change":{"user":"kZrHudF0VY2EtWJfYPZZ9Q==","historyId":"64149871135731b6911106ce","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:42:25.632Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,2dde9bf9-577b-5f7f-ad93-79babfc891a6,77fb6591-ecb5-5ddb-89b8-8b92a90a7f38,16859923-09a9-5e08-845b-688a577ecc34,b823ec32-f66e-5483-85cf-52ea922a8297","pathTokens":["Canada","Quebec","Cantons-de-l'est","Mont Pinacle","La boîte à surprises"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.89739,45.02442]},"bbox":[-71.89802618673419,45.023970339818135,-71.89675381326583,45.02486966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"uCPsMvZuVIOFz1LqkiqClw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.89802618673419,45.023970339818135],[-71.89675381326583,45.023970339818135],[-71.89675381326583,45.02486966018187],[-71.89802618673419,45.02486966018187],[-71.89802618673419,45.023970339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"Enter a description of this area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149871135731b6911106ce","prevHistoryId":"64149870135731b6911106c6","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:42:23.155Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:32.778Z","updatedBy":"LVk4CyGzVUKlccwQYeAuDA=="}
