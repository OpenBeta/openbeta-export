The sequence up this feature is the crux, and has been the scene of many failed redpoint attempts. A hard clip and a tricky sequence up the arete might keep your ego in check for a few tries too many if you underestimate this climb. \n  \n The second pitch is a classic and varied face climb, taking full advantage of the wall by zig-zagging through it up to an exposed finish. \n  \n The original line has two excellent variants, both climbing up and left from the rest below the bulge (instead of right and up the arete): \n  \n a) 4x4 (12a), which climbs slightly up and left past a small roof then joins the original line at the first anchor; \n  \n b) Go-Kart (12b), which branches out further left to tackle the upper roof and joins the second pitch directly without the pit-stop at the middle anchor.  \n  \n BMW is the sleek curvy, proud line that the rock seems to dictate, 4x4 is the route taken through seemingly rougher terrain, and Go-Kart will have you make obnoxious little engine noises as you wail time and again through its runouts and spanky cruxes. \n  \n Mostly considered easy for the grade (especially if you're tall), it is a great choice if you wish to break into 5.12.\n\nStarts in the dihedral formed by the hanging slab and the Grand Mur sector.
