Development began in the 90s, and has now become a place to push the limits of Quebec climbing. Most of the climbing is in the 5.9 to 5.13. there are a few 5.6 suitable for climbers still new to the sport, but are not as common as the harder routes. There is plenty of potential for this location to produce some future hard sport lines for this area. on the hike up to the climb there is also some nice bouldering before you hit the main wall. \n  \n The gneiss the climbs are made of is solid, but can be rather sharp when dealing with crimps. The rock also can be rather wet in places so be sure to bring chalk when you go.\n\nwhen you arrive at the parking lot where there is a self serve parking/climbing permit with a small fee.\n\nSEPAQ website: http://www.sepaq.com/pq/mor/index.dot?language_id=1 \n Telephone: +1-819-843-9855 \n parc.mont-orford@sepaq.com"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641498b3135731b691110a59","prevHistoryId":"641498ac135731b6911109e4","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:42:26.099Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:26.093Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
