It`s remote, it`s wild, it`s a great way to disconnect. \n Probably best to plan a multi-day trip with a bunch of friends and enjoy the tent  platforms near the cliffs. \n  \n A lot of the work done in the area are thanks to Jean-Philippe Henri, Dominic Asselin and many more. \n  \n The FQME is planning to have their yearly late summer event (Festiroc 2015) there so hopefully wilderness will be tamed a bit, trails cleared etc. \n  \n Take a look at the park's website for more info: \n  parcsregionaux.org/parcs-re… \n  \n Topo map of the climbing area"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149cd9135731b691113caf","prevHistoryId":"64149cd7135731b691113c94","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:01:06.803Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:01:08.441Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
