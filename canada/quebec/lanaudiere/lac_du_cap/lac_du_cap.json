Lots of new lines were opened and the landscape is changing. Note that there is now a beaver dam 200 m before you get to the camping area and 100 m before the main trail to the cliff. You can easily get across it on foot, but it’s another story on four wheels. The managers of the Reserve have been informed. Watch for more news!\nThere are a number of new routes on a new wall nearby, La Banlieue. It’s located a few kilometres before you reach the Cap, and its topo has been included with this one.\nThere are now 63 climbable pitches and another 10 or so pitches as projects. But there’s still plenty to do! If you’d like to get involved in some way, contact one of the setters. And please respect the unfinished projects!\nNote that during moose-hunting season (September 8 to October 5, 2018), hunting is the only activity allowed. No climbing!\nThis version is still incomplete and probably contains some errors. Consider yourself warned. The people who helped put this topo together cannot be held responsible for an accident resulting from an error or your climbing. When you are climbing at Lac du Cap, keep in mind that it is not an easily accessible place, and any rescue operation would be difficult. In an emergency, nevertheless, you can get cellphone reception at the top of the wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149bdb135731b691113182","prevHistoryId":"64149bd7135731b691113149","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":11,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:55:43.429Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:55:44.445Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
