The city is fairly open to climbers, they've created a parking lot, installed a dry toilet and clear out the snow from the lot for us ice-climbers. So please encourage the local economy to thank them! \n  \n Due to the high amount of climbers frequenting the area, always wear a helmet at the base and leave babies and dogs at home or very far from the cliff. \n  \n Don't go smashing developing ice, maybe it will fill in in a couple weeks. \n  \n -There's no garbage cans on the site so please pack it out. \n -Please refrain from starting fires and camping on the neighbours lot. \n  \n Rock Climbs"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414904d135731b69110b2e2","prevHistoryId":"64149043135731b69110b259","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:07:27.539Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:07:28.636Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
