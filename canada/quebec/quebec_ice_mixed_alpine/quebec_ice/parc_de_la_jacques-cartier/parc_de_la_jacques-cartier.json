The routes are serious affairs, providing seclusion and an alpine feel. \n  \n Bureaucracy and fees: \n J-C, like other SEPAQs, charges a daily access fee (currently $8.50 per person in 2021 for day use, plus $15 per over-night in the backcountry). Fees can be paid at the park gate (or online during COVID restrictions). \n  \n In order to climb in the J-C SEPAQ, (1) you must submit one backcountry access permit form per climber, (2) you must submit one liability waiver per team, containing the signatures of each climber. [Bureaucracy is the status-quo in the SEPAQ world.] SEPAQ asks you to submit the forms by email 7 days in advance (however, they seem to process the forms within a day, and imply they will accommodate shorter timescales on a best effort basis).  \n  \n Despite the bureaucratic ridiculousness (who knows what they're going to climb further in advance than a reliable weather forecast??), the individuals processing the forms are friendly and efficient. They will also help ensure no more than one team is targeting each route on a given day (which rarely happens for these remote climbs). \n If, for some unforeseen reason, you end up targeting a climb you do not have a permit for, be sure to give the right away to a team that does have a permit (first come, first served is not the ethic for this area). \n For more info, see:  sepaq.com/quoi-faire/expedi… \n  \n Huts: \n As of 2021, the only backcountry refuge that is exists along the route is the refuge Sautauriski at km 12.5 along the Chemin de la vallée (2.5 km from the visitor center). It can be booked through the SEPAQ (in 2021 due to COVID, this does not show up on the SEPAQ webpage, but is available by phoning the reservation center)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148f5d135731b69110a9e5","prevHistoryId":"64148f5d135731b69110a9db","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:03:38.090Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:25.216Z","updatedBy":"4yfO8it6Ukm/v9kmTY8ceg=="}
