There are numerous ice climbs near town, but the most notable routes ascent the 400-meter Northwest face of the namesake mountain on the East edge of town. These climbs rise right over the Saint Lawrence, thus the views are spectacular. The routes follow long gullies and can meander onto the rocky aretes to either side. Expect ice, snow and chossy rock. Ice can be thin at times and the rock can be quite suspect. As a result, the climbs can be rather runout. Pitons are very useful in the abundant chossy blocks. Be aware of avalanche danger.
