Saint-Alban and Pont-Rouge offer great cragging test pieces. For a bit more fun or when the conditions are too warm there's a lot more ice in the Bras-du-Nord valley with longer routes in more remote areas. In all cases follow the areas rules and access trails to enable us to keep the sites open for years to come."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148f27135731b69110a77e","prevHistoryId":"64148f0b135731b69110a5fa","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:01:52.805Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:19.390Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
