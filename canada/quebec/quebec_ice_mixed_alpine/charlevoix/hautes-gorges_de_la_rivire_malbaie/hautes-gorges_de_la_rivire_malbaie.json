In this valley on the cliff of Mont De L'Equerre is the very Famous 1000 foot ice climbs named La Pomme D'Or, la Loutre and La Ruée Vers l'Or as well as the 1500 foot rock climb Redcoats Resurrection and a few more recent adventure rock climbs. There are many other large crags in this valley first explored around the early 1970's.\n\nYou no longer need a permit to climb la Pomme d'Or, but do call ahead to alert the staff of your plans!\nHautes-Gorges-de-la-Riviere-Malbaie.\n\nAs of 2018, the fee to enter the park is $8.50 per day per person. Please contact the park adminisatration for overnight camping fees.\n\nEvery winter, skilled climbers take on the Pomme dOr, a spectacular and perilous rock face along Rivière Malbaie. Until this year, a lengthy 30Km ski access was required to reach the base of the route, but as of 2018, the road is now open during winter all the way to the dam at the foot of l'Acropole des Draveurs, a mere 5 Km from La Pomme d'Or! This means that under good conditions, a fast team of experienced ice climbers can leave Quebec city at 3.30 AM and finish the route before dark!\n\nWe strongly recommend bringing a satellite telephone or a SPOT-type emergency message device. There is no emergency telephone on the site in the winter and the cell phone network does not serve the parks territory. The only place you will get a phone signal is at the very top of the route."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64148eeb135731b69110a4a4","prevHistoryId":"64148ee7135731b69110a46b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:01:29.233Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:48:02.772Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
