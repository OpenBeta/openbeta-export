Many climbers have cut their teeth on this beautiful climb. From multi day adventures to day long solos, this climb gets traffic and deserving so. This climb is a classic in every sense of the word.\n\nThe route can range from 5 to 6+ depending on your line of attack. The opening pitches are in the easy 4 range until about 1/3 the way up. Then things get steeper. On the upper 1/3 you can choose to move either right or left and select from vertical pillars to lower angle ice In my experience the far left was easiest with the right being harder.\n\nP1 M3 PG/R 30m. First pitch below the headwall you go up on the right slab slinging bushes and sketchy rock pro. You can setup a belay here or start traversing left on the ramp but you also may want to simu-climb to avoid the drag to the next anchor.\n\nP2 M3 PG/R 40m. Traverse left using rock pro and depending on the conditions you may end up placing stubbies in the ice. Anchor off of pitons at the end of the traverse, 5m right of the ice corner which marks the start of the ice climb.\n\nP3 WI5 PG 50-60m. First 10m you may only get 10cm screws in though there’s some rock pro on the right.\n\nP4 WI5 50-60m.\n\nP5-6 WI5-6 50-60m. The second to last pitch is often the crux, a direct approach can get you into some WI6+ territory.\n\n\nAs of winter 2010-2011, you can drive past the outer gates and into the park itself on minimally maintained road to the inner gate. This shortens the approach significantly (31km vs 3.5km). You will pass many climbs in route but La Pomme will be noticeable off in the distance on your left.<br />On the river below the climb you can look up to scout your approach up the talus, and snowfield. There are alternative starts but the main route goes up a tight corner at the top of couloir that cannot really be seen from below.<br /><br />If camping, You'll need to pay the fee and can only camp in designated spots like across the river on the road side there is a small designated camping site with a picnic table as well.\nThe route goes with screws alone.  Bring enough to build all your anchors off of screws as well as protect each pitch.  Later in the season you will usually find a nice line of V-threads leading the way down.
