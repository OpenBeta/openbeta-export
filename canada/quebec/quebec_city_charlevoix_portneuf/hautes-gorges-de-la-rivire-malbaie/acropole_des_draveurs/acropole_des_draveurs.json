Open project. \n  \n ----------- \n  \n Pitch 1 - 5.10+ 50m \n  \n Climb the ramp that disappears into the dihedral. Sustained pitch in the 5.10 range. A magnificent crack hidden by vegetation is used for protection. Once clean, this pitch will be a genuine jewel! Build a belay station about 3 meter after the left face large chimney's end. \n  \n A possible variation would avoid vegetation and loose blocks by climbing the criss-crossing crack on the left face. \n  \n Pitch 2 - 5.9+ A1 30m \n  \n Delicately stem the dihedral. A piton would potentially save a lot of time here (aid). Layback to a thank-God jug and a nice crack (belay). \n  \n This pitch probably goes free in the 5.11 range. \n  \n Pitch 3 - 5.10+ 40m \n  \n Do not climb the crack above. Traverse right (thin) to a short right-facing dihedral (5.8). The rest of the pitch is easy. Build a belay station where the vegetation ends, at the base of a slab with many cracks. \n  \n Pitch 4 - 5.8 A1 50m \n Most of this pitch was aid-climbed on the first ascent. Aid-climb the slab for 5-10 meters, pendulum to the left to gain the left face of the dihedral and a slightly overhanging crack. Join the exit dihedral and use a white birch to belay. \n  \n This crack is most likely at least 5.12. Other exit variations are possible. \n  \n --------- \n  \n Grades and pitches' lengths need to be confirmed, as the route was mossy and somewhat loose on the first ascent.\n\nRide a bike or take the free shuttle bus to Barrage des Érables (i.e. the dam). <br />  <br /> Approach on a long and obvious 4th glass gully (about 700 meters). Plan at least 2 hours <br />  <br /> L'envol du Monarque start is located between Monarque and Momentum, on the left flank of l'Acropole. <br />  <br /> Descend by the popular Acropole des Draveurs hiker's trail (1h15).\nDouble rack to 2-3 inches.
