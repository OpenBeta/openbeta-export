Most of these routes can also be climbed with dry tooling and you get some short mixed lines in the winter. Most, if not all routes have to be led to install a TR. Some gear on routes is rotten, be aware. Many older routes have had their hardware refurbished in 2014.\n\nFor the mixed/drytooling routes, please see St-Alban Ice &amp; Mixed"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414968b135731b69110f089","prevHistoryId":"64149685135731b69110f027","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:33:54.945Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:25.810Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
