Perfect to prepare yourself for those Yosemite Valley classics (e.g. Zodiac). In June 2020, it was freed and became an interesting test-piece in traditional free climbing. This direct, all-gear, route goes up the steepest and most impressive wall. Please be mindful if you decide to aid it, try to go clean and go easy on the hammer.\n\nI haven't aid it to be honest so I will let others do the detailed description about the aid beta and will only provide beta for free climbing.\n\nStart right of the anchor and climb a short left facing corner (0.1/0.2 BD X4) to a tricky mantle onto a good foot hold to reach the main seam. Place some gear and mantle to a shallow ledge underneath a blank section capped with a few overlaps. Place a bomber finger size cam plus a critical sideway nut a foot above it (#4 BD Stopper) and get ready for the first crux. This next section is a little scary and involves very technical climbing on unusual features. So, battle up this section to a very good hold and place a tiny wire plus a micro cam (0 BD Z4). Mantle onto that good hold to a good left gaston. Place crappy gear in the tiny flake above your head, or not. There is also a good but blindly placed red ballnut in the seam to your right. Now its time for \"THE HIGH STEP\" which is kind of crux 1.5 and feels like your gonna slip. Do that to reach some thanks god gear placements (0.4-0.5 BD C4) and a good rest right underneath the main crux.\n\nPlace a good micro cam in the seam, clip the manky piton nest and go for it using compression moves, sloppy holds, a heel hook and more sloppy holds to finally reach a jug. Reestablish yourself above the crux and place a good cam (0.75 BD C4). Compose yourself and climb an easier section until you reach \"THE HEINOUS FINGERLOCK\", then climb the roof to a no-hand rest at the horizontal with good gear. Take a few good breath and get ready for the headwall. Climb to the bolt and clip it, or not, then fire the pumpy run out upper section. There are a few available RP's but they are quite strenuous to place.\n\n\n\nThe route follows a system of seem for its entire length. It starts on the spacious ledge to the right of the Marie 4 Poche/Cordonnier buttress. Start about 40 ft right of the Cordonnier corner. An old 2-bolt anchor and a rusty pin above it marks the start.\n\n\nThe crux section of the route seeps badly during the spring, but it dries and at some point around may/june, it stays dry. Looks like it then stays dry during summer and fall. \n\n\nIt is quite specific but I would say standard and offset micro cams and nuts, brassies and ballnuts.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"MJEXiTwrXZa1y4Rk6kNyQQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.5277,45.94478]}},"createdBy":"xk6ExJS0Wgu7GUrt12wW7w==","_change":{"user":"xk6ExJS0Wgu7GUrt12wW7w==","historyId":"6414a18c135731b69111757f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:21:16.514Z"},{"_id":"SXW6nnT1QN+YWZjvQqYgfA==","name":"Jamais deux sans trois","grades":{"yds":"5.10b"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Ulric Rousseau and Philippe Lanthier (2009)","length":18,"content":{"description":"Approach route for Vire a Bicyclette ledge. \n You can stop at the first anchor or top out on the ledge.\n\nBelow Club Sandwich ledge.\nSport <br /> 9 Bolts <br /> Full anchors."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"MJEXiTwrXZa1y4Rk6kNyQQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.5277,45.94478]}},"createdBy":"LVk4CyGzVUKlccwQYeAuDA==","_change":{"user":"LVk4CyGzVUKlccwQYeAuDA==","historyId":"6414a18c135731b691117589","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:21:16.981Z"},{"_id":"kkr13dYmQB2o97Dg58sKSA==","name":"L'Épée de Damoclès","grades":{"yds":"5.12-"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Reequipped by Marche family, 2019; FA Gelu Ionescu, 1990","length":71,"content":{"description":"\nP1 (5.12a) très technique avec un pas de dalle engageant à la fin.
