Its 22 000 km² (8800 mi²) of territory span south to north from One Thousand Islands River to the Mont Laurier; and east to west, from the Lanaudière region to the Outaouais region.\n\nPlains and valleys of the Laurentians offer trekking over the hills and mountains and discovering a kaleidoscope of fascinating landscapes bursting with beauty. This is a little holiday realm with mountainside and lakeside cottages, lovely towns and villages, ski hills, network of cross-country ski trails, and top-notch golf camps.\n\nSeduced by region's nature and unique attractions, many Canadians and Americans set up a vacation home at the Laurentians.\n\nThe Laurentian region enjoys a well-deserved reputation for fine dining and regional specialties. In addition to restaurant dining, visitors can savor a meal at a sugar shack, pick apples straight off the trees, and spend a night at a luxurious inn or lodge.\n\nA perfect destination for family vacations, the Laurentians house the National Park of Mont Tremblant, Quebec's largest protected area. The famous bike trail known as the Petit Train du Nord (Little Train from the North) winds its way through hills and villages for more than 200 km (125 mi). During the winter, that former railway line welcomes snowmobilers and cross-country skiers. Hundreds of destinations are there for you to choose!\n\n Closest Gym: Le Crux, Attitude Montagne bloc gym"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a141135731b691117175","prevHistoryId":"64149fc1135731b691116057","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":17,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:05:24.684Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:05:25.837Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
