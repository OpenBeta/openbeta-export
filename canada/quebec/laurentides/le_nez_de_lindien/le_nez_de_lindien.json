First (known) ascent: Adam Boulianne, Alexandre Sauvé, 05/2020. We climbed it ground up, brushed and cleaned as much as we could and left no bolts. All belays are on natural protection.\n\nPitch 1 (5.7, 20m) Climb up the gully to a big tree coming out of a roof. Loose rock, watch your belayer !\n\nPitch 2 (5.8, 25m) From the tree go straight up into the hard to protect stem box, make a committing slab move to the seam under the roof and traverse hard right. Go up the gully and build your belay close to the roof.\n\nPitch 3 (5.10+, 35m) A short, powerful crux off the anchor leads to a beautiful dihedral. Belay at the top of the corner. Classic.\n\nPitch 4 (5.9, 35m) Traverse hard left and follow the corners to a steep crack. Make a dynamic move to the top. Belay on the tree near the summit. Fun !\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzICMIu5zFY\n\nThe route starts in the obvious gully in the center of the face.\nStandard rack to #3, alpine draws, metal brush."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"gTEU/nkiV3+16Qdmw9oajA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.65959,46.24454]}},"createdBy":"2m1b+8JRV/eRDMlAhNKF4w==","_change":{"user":"2m1b+8JRV/eRDMlAhNKF4w==","historyId":"64149f1b135731b69111586f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:10:51.824Z"},{"_id":"eAmam/0aTz+Qms7BHru90Q==","name":"Unknown","grades":{"yds":"5.10"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","length":8,"content":{"description":"Follow the main crack line.
