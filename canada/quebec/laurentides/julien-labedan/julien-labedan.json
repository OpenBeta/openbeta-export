With it's simple approach, open area beneath many of the climbs and easy access to the top, expect a healthy number of people and families. \n If you can climb 5.10 you'll be able to dodge most of the people, and if you can climb the trad lines you'll be even better off. \n  \n In the past couple years, many of the climbs seem to have gained some fixed protection opening previously top-ropeable or hard trad routes to sport climbers, at this time, these \"upgrades\" have not been verified to see if trad pro is still required, proceed with care and check to see if you need to carry more than draws. \n  \n Aspect: South to slightly South East"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149e4d135731b691114dd2","prevHistoryId":"64149e49135731b691114db7","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:07:15.853Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:07:16.877Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
