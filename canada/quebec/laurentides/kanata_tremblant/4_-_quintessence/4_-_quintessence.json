Layback this to a tiny ledge and climb some wider cracks to the horizontals and to some good stemming stances. Face climb into the corner (crux) making strenous moves with hard to place pros. Use a good hold to finish on a thin section of face that leads to a tree-ledge with a 2-bolt anchor.\n\nClassic trad test-piece!\n\nThis is the left facing overhanging dihedral 15-20 ft to the left of the Quintessence crack.Â \nMicrocams to Camalot 3, doubles to 0.75 and nuts.
