Using some marginal slopers and a high right heel hook bust up right hand to a crimp rail and match it. Now do another even bigger left-hand dyno off the crimp rail to a really nice left hand flake hold way up high. Traverse left a bit and work your way up the lip to a gaston hold that feels kind of sketchy to get to (you are above a bad landing here btw). From here you can high step your right foot and top out.\n\nUphill from Louise Classique. Start on a low sloping rail down in a cave.\n3-4 pads and an attentive spotter. The boulder behind you is a serious obstacle and you could easily slam your head or back into it without an attentive spotter. The top-out is a bit spicy too and your spotter needs to be very attentive there."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"aDX9+zrbWs2ny0fIllDi9A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.1967,46.02882]}},"createdBy":"MYfYDru2XBehR9e3t3mGvw==","_change":{"user":"MYfYDru2XBehR9e3t3mGvw==","historyId":"6414a11a135731b691117019","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:19:22.869Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,2dde9bf9-577b-5f7f-ad93-79babfc891a6,3148a2a9-d5b8-5195-94bb-5003ad4f686f,e609b54f-888d-5b21-9eff-29af5306ae2e,87e5b9e1-4834-597b-8e5e-b700d469777a,a131f858-a844-54ed-8237-bb14f4199b57,bdfe3f21-b309-5163-aabe-07255066b48f,6835fdfb-3adb-5acd-a7cb-47c89650e2f4","pathTokens":["Canada","Quebec","Laurentides","Val-David","Val David Bouldering","Les Dames","Louise Boulders","Upper Louise"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"v6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.1967,46.02882]},"bbox":[-74.19734764868184,46.02837033981814,-74.19605235131817,46.02926966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"aDX9+zrbWs2ny0fIllDi9A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-74.19734764868184,46.02837033981814],[-74.19605235131817,46.02837033981814],[-74.19605235131817,46.02926966018187],[-74.19734764868184,46.02926966018187],[-74.19734764868184,46.02837033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Uphill from the Louise and Peggy Boulders."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414a11a135731b691117019","prevHistoryId":"6414a118135731b691117013","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:19:18.878Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:36.167Z","updatedBy":"LVk4CyGzVUKlccwQYeAuDA=="}
