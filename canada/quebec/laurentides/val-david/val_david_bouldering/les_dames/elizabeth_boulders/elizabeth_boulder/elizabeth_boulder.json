The short beta involves slapping up the left hand rail until you can high step your right foot next to your hand and deadpoint with your right hand into the sharp right crimp (need to be short and/or flexible). The tall beta (which I used) is to leave your feet a bit lower and leave your left hand lower onto the rail (where you start) to power up and deadpoint the sharp crimp in one move.\n\n\nBackside of the Elizabeth boulder\n3 pads is ideal - landing is covered by logs/trees and is a bit rocky and often wet."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"FLYAbpAyVnGYswiKO4PacA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.1967,46.02882]}},"createdBy":"MYfYDru2XBehR9e3t3mGvw==","_change":{"user":"MYfYDru2XBehR9e3t3mGvw==","historyId":"6414a103135731b691116f31","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T17:18:59.253Z"},{"_id":"nP6ZaC6OSOeaRA9eXJL+yA==","name":"La traversée de l'orque","grades":{"vscale":"v6"},"type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":true,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"unknown","length":3,"content":{"description":"Start on the right hand of the sloping lip and traverse left until you can top out. There are two different ways to do this. One is the \"purist\" style and the other is the \"unpure\" style with some variations mixed between the style. The purist style uses ONLY the lip until you can reach the good jug and mantle out (V6). The upure style uses the lip and some crimpy features a little above the lip and allows for some high-heel hooking above the lip before toping out which makes it a bit easier (this is how I did it).\n\nOn the Elizabeth boulder right as you enter the forest.
