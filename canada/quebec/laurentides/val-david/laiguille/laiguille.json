The routes are mostly bolted sport, with a few mixed (bolted/trad)thrown in for variety. The grades are mainly from mid to high, ie. 5.9-5.11 and up. A fun place to climb, with many good looking routes. \n  \n The bouldering field is very interesting. The field is well blazed, with each big rock's name marked. The rock is solid sweet granite from V0 to V11. You can find the topo on the Val-David Bouldering Area"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149ff6135731b69111631d","prevHistoryId":"64149feb135731b691116280","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T17:14:06.372Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:48:02.552Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
