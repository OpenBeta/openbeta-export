I will add pictures and routes shortly** \n Good selection of climbing on solid granite. Difficulty ranges from rediculously easy (5.1) to hard (5.12+). Most of the climbing here is traditional or mixed (gear and bolts). The cliff is home to many old-school trad routes and area classics like Piton Highway (5.7), Peggy (5.7+) Rupert Bear Goes Hiking (5.9) and The Original Route (5.10c). However, there are also harder sport routes like Direttissisma (5.11a), Joy of Life (5.11a) and some unnamed 5.12's. \n  \n The area is known for it's stiff grades ; many climbs were put up in the period between the 1950's and the 1980's. Keep that in mind. A notorious sandbag is Cotter Crack, which gets 5.10b, but many say the grade is more in the range of 5.11a/b (speculation, as I have not yet done it myself).
