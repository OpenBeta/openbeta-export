Has 7 bolted routes along with the potential for maybe 10 more routes. Difficulty ranges between 5.5 and 5.12+ projects. \n Rock needs to be cleaned but is good once all is broken loose. \n Two sections with the access to the bottom of the cliff via a rope system inbetween. \n As of 2014, location is overgrown a fair amount.
