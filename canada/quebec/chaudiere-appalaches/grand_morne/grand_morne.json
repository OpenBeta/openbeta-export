It is possible to set up top-ropes on some of the shorter climbs towards the ends of the cliff.\n\nRoutes range from 15m to 120m in length and from 5.2 to 5.12b in difficulty. Most routes have fixed rappel/belay bolted anchors. Rappelling is the best way to descend.\n\nThe rock is sharp and routes can be dirty due to lack of traffic. There are some loose blocks so wear a helmet and keep away from the base of the cliff when people are climbing above.\n\nCamping on platforms is possible at the top.\n\nA guidebook (Guide d'escalade du Grand Morne) is available the Atmosphere in Sherbrooke or at the hut in the parking when somebody is there."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149b6b135731b691112c41","prevHistoryId":"64149b66135731b691112c12","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":11,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:54:24.247Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:48:00.369Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
