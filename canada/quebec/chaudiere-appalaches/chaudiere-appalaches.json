With its 200 km of riverside roads, this region counts some of the oldest and richest history and legacy in the country. It also includes many lovely villages, many of which are considered to be the most beautiful in the province of Québec. The Chaudière-Appalaches region is named after the Chaudière River that meanders throughout the Beauce region before flowing into the St. Lawrence in Lévis. To the South of the region, bordering the state of Maine, are the rolling mountain tops of the Appalachians in the Thetford, Etchemins, Bellechasse, Lotbinière and Côte-du-Sud regions. \n Chaudière Appalache Tourism"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64149b7d135731b691112d07","prevHistoryId":"64149b6f135731b691112c66","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T16:54:20.590Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T16:54:22.605Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
