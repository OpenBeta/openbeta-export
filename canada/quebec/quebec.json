The \"French\" culture adds to the exotic nature of a climbing trip here.\n\nQuebec is a great place to get away, Climbing has been an institution in this province since the 40s. You'll be amazed at the quantity, quality and potential of routes. Mountainproject only lists a tiny fragment of the existing climbs, stay tuned, more gets added every weeks.\n\nJe serrais ravi si des francophones pouvaient rajouter des descriptions dans la langue de Molière (version simple;) de secteurs et de voies.
