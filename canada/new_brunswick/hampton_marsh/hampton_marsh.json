The rock quality is suspect on most climbs, so helmets are strongly recommended. The crag faces East and gets plenty of morning sun which makes it a good spot to do a bit of winter climbing. The main area is roadside and has no approach which is an added bonus. If you are looking to crank hard moves, Monster Wall is up and left through the woods from the roadside wall and has a good selection of hard routes (several of them very short)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641424b7f0cf0083296055de","prevHistoryId":"641424aaf0cf00832960552d","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:28:23.861Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:28:25.524Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
