The Creek Wall features at least a day's worth of well protected sport routes while the taller Main Wall has over a dozen routes. Several other walls/cliffs are scattered around the area featured sport, trad and mixed routes. The cliff faces south and gets almost all day sun. It would be possible to climb here both early in the season and in late fall. Climbing here on a hot summer day is going to be difficult as there is very little shade. This place is fairly remote. There are no houses nearby and cell reception is poor."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641425cef0cf0083296062f1","prevHistoryId":"641425c9f0cf0083296062a3","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":9,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:31:24.403Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:21.072Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
