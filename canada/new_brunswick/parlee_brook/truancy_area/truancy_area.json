It has it all. Steep sustained climbing, breathtaking setting, a stunning formation of ice. The difficulty will depend on a number of factors. Ambient temp, when it forms, if water is running on it, etc. Not long after it forms is usually when it is the most difficult. It has been know for incredibly techy feet, chandelier and tube formations that are not only challenging to climb but very difficult to protect. Most likely WI6 or 6+ in early season. After it forms it will build and probably ease down to a 5+ mid to late season. \n\n\n\nThis is the first route encountered in the area found up and left as you enter the ravine. \n\nA rack of screws."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"dQp22OUaXZC9sI8qASBgLQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-65.42748,45.64758]}},"createdBy":"b91PKkSHXHSZuhalO8QQRA==","_change":{"user":"b91PKkSHXHSZuhalO8QQRA==","historyId":"6414255bf0cf008329605e92","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:31:23.500Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,52b8e499-5929-5542-b1e5-6934c4035048,20f1f0de-bc52-5178-b10b-ed02ac15ce4e,750a76d8-e51a-5d90-bdb0-8f2a0120602d","pathTokens":["Canada","New Brunswick","Parlee Brook","Truancy Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-65.42748,45.64758]},"bbox":[-65.42812322646148,45.64713033981813,-65.42683677353854,45.64802966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"dQp22OUaXZC9sI8qASBgLQ=="},"content":{"description":"This is the hidden gem of Parlee with Truancy Falls being the grand prize.
