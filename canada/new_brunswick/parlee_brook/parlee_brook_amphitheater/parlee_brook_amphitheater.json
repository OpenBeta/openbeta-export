Be aware that the amphitheater is frequently visited by a growing hiking population. The hikers are often unaware of the hazards of falling ice so do not hesitate to let them know if they put themselves in danger. Weekends are particularly the worst with upwards of 200 people a day. The climbing here is mostly long single pitch. Double ropes are useful especially in early season before the base gets filled in with snow."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142554f0cf008329605e5c","prevHistoryId":"64142553f0cf008329605e56","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:31:14.009Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:18.157Z","updatedBy":"b91PKkSHXHSZuhalO8QQRA=="}
