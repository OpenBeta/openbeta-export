Varied, interesting climbing through a vast array of features. The crux is on the third pitch transitioning from the solid ice to the slab which is poorly protected and sometimes rotting out due to sun exposure. \n Pitch 1: Easy snow, ice and sometimes rock to the base of the steepness. \n Pitch 2: Starts out easy then quickly changes to steep and sometimes quite technical. \n Pitch 3: Crux pitch. It is recommended to combine with pitch 2 and quite easily done.\n\nFound about 200 yards downstream from Deliverance. Impossible to miss. Rap the route with double ropes.\nFull rack of ice screws.
