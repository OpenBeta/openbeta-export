Access can be complicated due to the fact that this is in a wilderness area with no houses, businesses or towns nearby. In the event of an accident, rescue would be difficult. Cell phone coverage here is sporadic so a sat phone or Â and In Reach are a good idea. The reward for the risk and hard work to get in this area is definitely worth it though. The climbing is superb, it has an alpine feel and the shear beauty of this place is quite breathtaking."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142639f0cf008329606842","prevHistoryId":"64142631f0cf0083296067cd","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:34:33.059Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:34:34.748Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
