As such it is closed to mining and forestry activity but open for recreation. It is a remote wilderness area that borders on the coast of the Bay of Fundy and part of the Caledonia Highlands containing mostly rhyolite rock on several long steep walls up to 600 feet in height. Most of the routes follow gullies that drain into the river. There are several waterfalls and lots of walls with seeping water. All this make for many established routes and potential for more."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641424ebf0cf008329605898","prevHistoryId":"641424dcf0cf0083296057bf","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:29:14.852Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:29:15.896Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
