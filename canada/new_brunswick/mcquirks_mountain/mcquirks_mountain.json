The cliff offers gear protected crack climbing with a 220 foot tall center face and slightly shorter flanks left and right. Most routes are two pitches with bolted belays. The rock is generally very high quality Devonian granite. The rock is very similar to what you will find at Cathedral Ledge in North Conway. The grades range from 5.5 to 5.12. Gear is generally good throughout the cliff. A single rack of nuts and cams to 3\" should work well on everything here but it is nice to have doubles and a 4\" piece. A 60 meter rope will work fine but a 70 is handy for descending some routes. The shortest climb is about 35 feet while the longest is a 3 pitch link up covering about 270 feet of vertical ground. The best time to climb here is in early spring and from August through October. During these times the bugs are either at a minimum or non existent. There is great camping just below the base of the cliff with water sources nearby. There are numerous rappel stations from the top and also an easy walk off north and south.\nYou will find most amenities close by in the town of St. George - gas, groceries, beer at the Shell gas station convenience store, restaurants, hardware, etc."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142535f0cf008329605d08","prevHistoryId":"6414252df0cf008329605c7f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:29:49.155Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:14.094Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
