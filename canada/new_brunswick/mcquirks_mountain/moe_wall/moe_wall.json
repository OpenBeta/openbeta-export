Go to the right end of Moe Wall, walk up the right side and flake your rope on a nice ledge between 3 maples and one spruce about 20 feet above the base. <br />Pitch 1 - Start up on gorgeous stone making a high angle traverse toward the middle of the middle of Moe Wall, if that makes sense. From the mid point traverse horizontally across the rest of Moe Wall and gain the tree ledge of the Main Wall. Stop and belay at the first bolted anchor.<br />Pitch 2 - Continue traversing right across the main wall. Step down where the Main Wall meets the X Wall. Ascend the Dance Platform then step left to the Magic X bolted anchor and belay. <br />Pitch 3 - Make one move down then head toward the corner of 50 Mission clipping some bolts along the way. Tenuous moves with poor feet near the overlap will lead you to the corner where it eases off once again.
