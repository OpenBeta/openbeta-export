Trad, sport, ice, aid and top-roping. Quality rock, excellent pro-placement, great views from up high.\n\nThe Welsford area located in Southern NB has 5 crags and offers lots of opportunities wether you want to trad climb, sport climb, Toprope, Aid climb and even ice climb! The climbing in Welsford is situated on the southern tip of the Gagetown Military Base. As a result, climbers have an agreement with the military to be able to access the cliffs. If you're not an AscentNB member, you'll have to drive to camp Petersville 9km North of Welsford to get a day pass. If you're an AscentNB member, please call in.\n\nHere is a summary of the 5 crags:\n\nCochrane Lane\nBy far the biggest crag in New Brunswick. With its 350 routes on beautiful pink Granite, it is by far the most popular area in New Brunswick. The climbing here is mostly trad but there is a fair bit of mix routes and sport routes, especially in the 5.11 range.\n\nSunnyside\nA newly developped cliff, Sunnyside offers climbers a chance to relax and clip some nice shiny bolts. There are about 30 climbs and grades range from 5.7 to 5.12c. You can find jugs, crimps, slopes and a few cracks on these short to medium size diabase routes.\n\nMount Douglas\nWas rediscovered in 2010 by a local climber and since then a bunch of work has been put into it. The''Dalles'' are not to be missed here as they offer high quality moderate challenges on well protected slabs. Also, Idoprofen is one of the few hand jam cracks in NB and is not to be missed by the 5.11 climber.\n\nBald Peak It offers about 15 toprope routes on high quality granite and gives climbers one of the best view in the Nerepis valley.\n\nEagle Rock\nRediscovered in 2012 by local climbers who have been putting new traditional routes up. This crag is in Welsford but isn't affected by the Gagetown agreement. Climb at will."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414280af0cf008329607e12","prevHistoryId":"641427a7f0cf008329607a77","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:35:10.722Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:21.323Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
