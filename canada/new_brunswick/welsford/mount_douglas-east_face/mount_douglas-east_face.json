It was rediscovered in 2010 and since a trail has been put in and over 25 routes have been established. The climbing here is on granite but despite the rock type, most routes here have bolts around the crux. One exception is the 3 stars all trad hand crack called Idoprofen. It is probably the best route at Mount Douglas. \n  \n Les Dalles de St-Anselme is an extension to the east face of Mount Douglas and offers high quality slab climbing on pristine stone. The grades are moderate here and the bolts are close so this would be a good place to start leading routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641427a4f0cf008329607a52","prevHistoryId":"64142799f0cf0083296079b9","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:40:46.505Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:55.917Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
