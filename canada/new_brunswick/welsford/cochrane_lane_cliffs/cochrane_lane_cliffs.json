Trad, mixed gear and occasional sport routes. Quality rock abounds. Routes range in length from 30 to 200 feet. It is possible to link together 3 or 4 pitches to provide somewhat of a multi pitch experience but the majority of the climbing is single pitch. There are a high number of cracks but few pure crack climbs. The gear is generally good but be on the lookout for suspect rock as there are a few locations where the rock is less than bomber. This is generally a very quiet, out of the way area to climb. It is not uncommon for climbers to show up here on a weekday and have the entire cliff to themselves. The current guidebook, authored by Dominic Caron, is available at local outdoor retailers. Please respect local access regulations. This cliff is on CFB Gagetown property and is strictly regulated. Members of Ascent New Brunswick are permitted to call in for access. Everyone else must go to Camp Petersville (12 k north on route 7) to obtain a day use pass from Range Control. Please practise Leave No Trace principles. There is a spring directly below Joe's Garage. Be certain not to deposit human waste anywhere within 60 meters of the spring. In the event of an emergency call 911 and Range Control 506-422-2131."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142752f0cf008329607624","prevHistoryId":"6414273cf0cf008329607494","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":22,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:35:12.873Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:14.287Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
