Hughes, S. Bethune","length":67,"content":{"description":"\nPitch 1: Take the 5.8 Variation of Pete's Retreat which is located up and left of Wise Crack. Begin left of the corner. From the ground make a move up to a juggy ledge. Traverse the ledge almost to the corner then launch into the hand crack. Follow this up through blocky climbing then up a short face left of a big chimney. Step up and clip a bolt before making a somewhat committing move up and left to an arete. Follow the arete to a big ledge. Belay here on two bolts. Most would consider this pitch to be G but there is a slight run out before the bolt on easy terrain. 25 meters, 5.8 PG\n\n Pitch 2: From the belay ledge step right over the chimney, traversing under an overhanging wall on good holds and gear toward an overhanging crack leading up and right. Crank up through the crack then step left to a bolt protected slab. From this point there are two variations leading to a ledge and belay station 3 meters above the bolt. One variation goes out around the arete. Delicate footwork and thin holds lead up the arete with thrilling exposure. The other line goes straight up from the bolt through an overhang. Both lines are stunning with brilliant movement and exposure. Belay at the ledge on bolts. 15 meters 5.9 G\n\n Pitch 3: Step left, plug a bomber #1 camalot then pull out around the arete. Make a burly move up to a small ledge. Continue toward a bolt protected crux. Climb through the balancy crux up to a nice hand crack that leads to an offwidth. Move up the surprising pleasant offwidth then easy 5 th to the cheekbone anchor. 25 m 5.10- G.\n\n There are no rappel stations on the route so either rap Cheekbone Corner or take the 3rd class walk off down and left into the Amphitheater (fixed ropes here).\n\n This is a wildly exposed climb that requires good rope management and thoughtful gear placements to protect the second. It climbs best in three pitches. Pitch 1 and 2 can be combined.\n\n\nCheekbone Area\n\nSingle rack to 4\" piece. Bolted belays. Bolts protect runout on all three pitches.
