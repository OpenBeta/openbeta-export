Minkey is arguably CL's best trad wall with an extremely high concentration of classic routes. The only other wall that could rival Minkey in quality is Joe's Garage. The routes here are all in the 30m range and mostly vertical though a few routes pull through the prominent roof on the center-left part of the wall. Minkey can seem a bit intimidating at first due to its size and imposing appearance but most routes offer good protection. Keep an eye out for the PG rated routes though as they will offer a bit more of a mental challenge.\n\nThe right side of Minkey proper (near where the approach trail meets the cliff) can be a bit confusing since several routes climb crack systems that lean to the left and many variations and linkups have been done on this part of the wall. If you are unfamiliar with this part of the wall it's a good idea to take a close look at a topo to make sure you know where your chosen route climbs. That being said, once you know where you are going, all the routes follow logical features and have a nice flow to them."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142713f0cf008329607246","prevHistoryId":"64142712f0cf00832960723c","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":28,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:38:25.621Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:38:43.170Z","updatedBy":"+pQxv9RMXDyzOGCPgOARyA=="}
