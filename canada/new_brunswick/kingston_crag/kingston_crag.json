This is a very convenient crag having only a 5 min approach, and the majority of the climbs can be accessed from above for easy top rope setup.\n\nThe rock quality is pretty good for being rhyolite and basalt there are some loose rocks/pebbles wearing a helmet is strongly recommended.\n\nThe cliff gets direct sunlight from early morning to mid afternoon. Located on the Lake road just 5 min from the gondola point ferry."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641424d2f0cf008329605746","prevHistoryId":"641424cdf0cf00832960570c","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:28:45.973Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:14.074Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
