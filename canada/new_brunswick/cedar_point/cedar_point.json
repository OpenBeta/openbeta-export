Although, this doesn't sound appealing, the crag is nestled in an old limestone quarry in a peaceful residential neighbourhood. Despite being a decommissioned quarry, the rock is very solid as no explosives were used when it was exploited over a century ago. \n This place collects sun, and dries out much more quickly than you'd expect. If the wind is blowing the right direction, it can be an excellent choice for early march / late november! That being said, sometimes the wind funnels in the quarry and it can be cold even in mid summer. \n  \n Please be courteous while visiting the area. The approach and the cliffs are on private property and the climbing here is tolerated. One confrontation with the owners or the neighbours and the privilege of climbing here could be lost."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641423cef0cf008329604c43","prevHistoryId":"641423cdf0cf008329604c39","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":22,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:24:26.699Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:24:46.189Z","updatedBy":"5GVYJlIMVIKunjKVN4DxuA=="}
