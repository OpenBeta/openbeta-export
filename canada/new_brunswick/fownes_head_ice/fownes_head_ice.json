Most of the routes are located in secluded coves so they see very little sun. The coastline faces generally south east so belays are often sunny and pleasant. A short walk of about 20 minutes from the parking will put you at the first route which requires a rapell to access."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142409f0cf008329604f16","prevHistoryId":"641423fff0cf008329604e9e","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:25:32.219Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:13.993Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
