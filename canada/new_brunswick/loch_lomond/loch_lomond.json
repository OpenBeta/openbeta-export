The rock offers lots of features which are surprisingly fun to climb and the experience is unique when belaying from a canoe or boat.  Top -roping can be setup  by landing a boat to the left of the Craig and walking to the top.  The water is not deep at the base of the cliff (2m or less) so a stick clip is recommended (this is not a deep water soloing spot).  Loch Lomond Craig gets a lot of sun in the day and provides and excellent opportunity to cool off in the water during the hot summer days.  If taking a boat, check the winds.  On windy days, the waves can pickup and toss the boat around at the bottom of the Craig.  The base has several hangers to fix your bow and stern while climbing.  Bring bumpers for your boat to prevent damage from it thrashing against the cliff.  The rock is Volcanogenic Lapilli Tuff which is pleasantly featured however can be crumbly in places (bing your helmet).  Due to the lack of traffic, the routes can be dirty with some lichen but the experience is so unique, it is worth the adventure.  Loch Lomond is located on City of Saint John land."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641424fcf0cf00832960598c","prevHistoryId":"641424fbf0cf008329605982","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":11,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:29:41.730Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:52:17.943Z","updatedBy":"a+PPSmCOULK1f+xl6QcXfA=="}
