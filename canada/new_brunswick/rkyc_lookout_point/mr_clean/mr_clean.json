Swap left foot with your left hand, stand up, and make the rest of the climb.\n\n1 pad"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"HxkseNr1WM+l2ZIEYP5OKQ==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-66.0914,45.30582]}},"createdBy":"x5iG+hWHUl6HJHZBFJNY5A==","_change":{"user":"x5iG+hWHUl6HJHZBFJNY5A==","historyId":"641425e3f0cf008329606396","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:33:39.499Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,52b8e499-5929-5542-b1e5-6934c4035048,c6c78e35-b30c-5fc5-8d25-0f14906d8a2d,1f192c78-daf5-58cf-a5d9-920460fe4e29","pathTokens":["Canada","New Brunswick","RKYC Lookout Point","Mr. Clean"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"v2"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-66.0914,45.30582]},"bbox":[-66.09203933712269,45.30537033981815,-66.09076066287732,45.30626966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"HxkseNr1WM+l2ZIEYP5OKQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-66.09203933712269,45.30537033981815],[-66.09076066287732,45.30537033981815],[-66.09076066287732,45.30626966018186],[-66.09203933712269,45.30626966018186],[-66.09203933712269,45.30537033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"A great spot with varied faces and some really solid conglomerate.
