There may be potential for mixed climbing in frozen low quality rock. There is nothing special about this climb and I wouldn't bother driving long distances for this. That said, it is a beautiful (albeit small) climb in the least expected place. Can easily be soloed and a TR can be set from the top of the climb.\n\nThere is no avalanche danger.\n\n\n\nApproach follows the bottom of the tobogganing hill from Lindsay Valley lodge. Cross a creek and follow groomed trail uphill for 5 minutes. (10 minutes from lodge). Falls will be at crest of hill on the right. There is a small viewpoint platform that is visible from the trail.Â \n\ntrees"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"RW3bwRc5WL2wBqkopHd1vA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-66.42517,45.85529]}},"createdBy":"q2WFzj3gUkm7HV5VuATQPA==","_change":{"user":"q2WFzj3gUkm7HV5VuATQPA==","historyId":"641424daf0cf0083296057a4","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:29:14.418Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,52b8e499-5929-5542-b1e5-6934c4035048,456ddbc1-1739-58bd-b006-a928a47775bc","pathTokens":["Canada","New Brunswick","Lindsay Valley (CFB Gagetown)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-66.42517,45.85529]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"RW3bwRc5WL2wBqkopHd1vA=="},"content":{"description":"A small ice climb nestled in Oromocto, NB.
