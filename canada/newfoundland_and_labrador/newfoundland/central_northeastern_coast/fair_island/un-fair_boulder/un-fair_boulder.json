The features and subsequent line pop off the face of the boulder. A matched hand start on a jug throws to a high crimp and bump onto a left juggy rail. A layback and solid heel hook will get you in position to top out. The granite can be sharp on particular holds, so be prepared to tape up!\n\nThis problem is on the Un-Fair Boulder, on Fair Island, Newfoundland.\n2 to 3 pads are ideal, as there is a fair sized rock in the middle of the landing if you pop off the layback. Also, there is no easy way down from the top of the boulder. Therefore, a jump onto a stack of pads is required."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"1rbAi+1uWw6EicJQzRf2Tg==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-53.70853,48.99002]}},"createdBy":"HfN+1OrBX926g9H9t0Vi7Q==","_change":{"user":"HfN+1OrBX926g9H9t0Vi7Q==","historyId":"64142ba5f0cf00832960a315","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:58:13.883Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,5a364459-99da-57cc-8a33-8d38c4705c8e,9aacbf9f-95ad-5c06-8d23-d8c087582171,d6b6c08b-ed6e-5b0e-8489-c250cd17f64e","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","Central / Northeastern Coast","Fair Island","Un-Fair Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-53.70853,48.99002]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"1rbAi+1uWw6EicJQzRf2Tg=="},"content":{"description":"This lone, large conglomerate granite boulder is exposed in the middle of a marsh, next to a cluster of trees.
