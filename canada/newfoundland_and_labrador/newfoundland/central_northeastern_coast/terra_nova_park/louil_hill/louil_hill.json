Louil Hill is often  windy and the weather can be cold and rainy so make sure to check the weather before leaving. Most if not all the rock on Louil Hill is granite and it makes for great climbing with some fair size faces. Louil Hill stands at around 450 ft high above sea level and provides great views as well as climbing.  There are no bolts, or fixed anchors however almost all of the routes can be top roped. There are a number of boulders and boulder sized cliff faces as well.  The hill itself has a couple of nice climbable faces in the 20-50ft range, but the escarpment to the south that runs between the two hills is about 300m long and has a good number of potential routes from ~30 to 100ft.  Most of these have yet to be climbed. The final approach to the area will require about 0.5km of bush whacking."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142bcef0cf00832960a475","prevHistoryId":"64142bccf0cf00832960a46f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:58:51.022Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:58:54.436Z","updatedBy":"ne4ik1jTXVuVeyfAOcZMng=="}
