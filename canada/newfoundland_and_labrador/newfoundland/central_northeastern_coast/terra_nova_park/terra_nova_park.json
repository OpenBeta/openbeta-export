There has been almost no development of climbing routes in this area.  Most of the best looking and largest crags are found along the coast and are accessible only by boat.  However, there are also a number of smaller areas accessible by short hikes from roads.  The park stretches along the Trans Canada Highway from Glover town in the west to around Port Blandford in the east, but most of the climbing potential is in the western end and along the coast."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142bd2f0cf00832960a49a","prevHistoryId":"64142bcef0cf00832960a47f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":3,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:58:47.987Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:58:49.180Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
