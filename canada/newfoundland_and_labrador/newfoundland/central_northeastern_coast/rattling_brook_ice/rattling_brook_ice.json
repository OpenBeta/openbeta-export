It has a lower volume of water flow and freezes up quicker.\n\nP1. (WI4) 100' of vertical climbing takes you to a good belay ledge where you will likely be able to stand up.\n\nP2 (WI3) The next 100' goes up a series of shorter vertical ledges.\n\nP3 (WI3) The final 100' is similar to the second pitch and eventualy takes you to the trees. From here you can either rap back down or continue on up through the trees (Still on ice but easy) to the very top of the hill and find a way to way back down through the woods.\n\nFrom Wojtek Pagacz:\n\n\"I believe William Ferguson and I (Wojtek Pagacz) may have the first ascent, Feb 2012.  We called it \"Local Celebrities\" because CBC news showed up and put us on tv.  Also \"the whole\" town watched us climb from the bridge.\"\n\n\nScrews"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"FyOKF0RoXh2k45IhkOhptw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-56.17962,49.62288]}},"createdBy":"+5JSdSB8UkS+ckGOn2an9w==","_change":{"user":"+5JSdSB8UkS+ckGOn2an9w==","historyId":"64142bc7f0cf00832960a449","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:58:47.457Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,5a364459-99da-57cc-8a33-8d38c4705c8e,17238a17-4468-5e1d-a4e3-922190e869b7","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","Central / Northeastern Coast","Rattling Brook (Ice)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-56.17962,49.62288]},"bbox":[-56.18031411740377,49.622430339818145,-56.178925882596225,49.62332966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"FyOKF0RoXh2k45IhkOhptw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-56.18031411740377,49.622430339818145],[-56.178925882596225,49.622430339818145],[-56.178925882596225,49.62332966018186],[-56.18031411740377,49.62332966018186],[-56.18031411740377,49.622430339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"300' ice climb located next to the community of Rattling Brook"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142bc7f0cf00832960a449","prevHistoryId":"64142bc6f0cf00832960a443","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:58:45.439Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:14.228Z","updatedBy":"+5JSdSB8UkS+ckGOn2an9w=="}
