These boulders lay at the base of the scree field just downhill of the large overhang on Wrickled Rock. The boulders get a good bit of sun, and are mostly good quality rock, though some cleaning wouldn't hurt. Boulders are 12-20 plus feet with vert, slab, steep, and roof sections. Id guess grades could be had from V0-V8or 9. I will update with further info after more exploration."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142ca7f0cf00832960ad5d","prevHistoryId":"64142ca6f0cf00832960ad57","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:02:29.639Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:02:30.703Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
