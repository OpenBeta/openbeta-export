From here the rock quality gets much better as you go up. Be careful pulling onto the ledge as the rock here is the worst on the route, however the protection is good. I would recommend bringing a double length alpine draw for the bolt right under the ledge for extending. From the ledge make your way up some nice, slightly open handed edges on good rock. The route then eases up for a bit passing several bolts. Once you make your way to the last two bolts, just focus up and take your time. The rock quality here is nice, the holds are thin, and the slabby finish feels quite steep. Keep your composure and find the holds to clip the anchor. The last maybe three moves are the crux but once you make it through you have good clipping holds. 70 meter rope is mandatory to rap. \n\n\n\nOnly route on the wall as of now. \n\n\n13 bolts (bring one alpine) to two bolt rap anchors.\n"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"ZdxKPWayVgCcUv9PVhYLHw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-57.85295,48.98131]}},"createdBy":"INpEe3F+VHy3eYImdsqjig==","_change":{"user":"INpEe3F+VHy3eYImdsqjig==","historyId":"64142cb1f0cf00832960adb1","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:02:41.093Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,9275900f-cf51-5bcc-96f3-da7d6efe2e23,93ae2eef-1650-52d0-a994-1debef333463,65dc4a3d-66b2-5600-9c52-ff4f56160b1f","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","West Coast","North Shore Highway","Wrickled Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c/d"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-57.85295,48.98131]},"bbox":[-57.85363513885653,48.980860339818136,-57.852264861143475,48.98175966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"ZdxKPWayVgCcUv9PVhYLHw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-57.85363513885653,48.980860339818136],[-57.852264861143475,48.980860339818136],[-57.852264861143475,48.98175966018186],[-57.85363513885653,48.98175966018186],[-57.85363513885653,48.980860339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"Down Wild Cove Road there is a good chunk of rock that can be seen from just about anywhere in Corner Brook. This crag is near the end of the road, just west of of the diamond shaped orange wall. While looking at it from the road, the left hand side has a giant overhang, and the right side has a distinct wrinkle or fold in the rock near the top. The area is quite secluded, and offers good climbing above the valley floor with a beautiful view. It is sunny most of the afternoon and get surprisingly little wind. This crag is far from anywhere, but surprisingly easy to get to, with a fairly easy approach that is about 15-20 minutes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142cb1f0cf00832960adb1","prevHistoryId":"64142cb0f0cf00832960adab","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:02:39.066Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:10:14.731Z","updatedBy":"INpEe3F+VHy3eYImdsqjig=="}
