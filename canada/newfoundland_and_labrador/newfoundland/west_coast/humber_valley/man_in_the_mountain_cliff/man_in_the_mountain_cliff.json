Clip another bolt on the right-hand side and head up the fractured face towards the next bolt. Step left and clip one more bolt before pulling up onto the slabby ramp on the left (Note: Once the last bolt before the slab is clipped, it is best to down-climb and extend the first two bolts on the fractured face to eliminate the rope drag.). Follow the bolts up the slab to the anchor.\n\nPitch 2 (5.8+, 30m) Move up through the chimney and clip a bolt on the left-hand side, then continue stemming up locating bolts on the right-hand side. Follow the bolts to the base of a short, steep wall and head straight up (this is the crux of the route and is well protected). Head up the steep wall and then continue up easier terrain to the anchor (this anchor is located on the best ledge of the route and so is a good spot for a break). \n\nPitch 3 (5.6, 30m) Climb up on top of the large block on the right and clip a bolt. Continue right to the top of the next block to the next bolt, and then start heading up the bolt line trending right to the next anchor. \n\nPitch 4 (5.7, 30m) Continue trending right to a short corner and then head up the corner into easier climbing above. Once out of the corner, head up and slightly left following bolts. At the steep wall, move left to the anchor. (Note. Once out of the corner, the route travels back left over top of the lower anchor on somewhat loose rock. Caution should be taken so as not to knock any rock down onto the belayer.)\n\nRappel note: if rappelling from this pitch, rap straight down from the anchor over the steep wall (free hanging rappel) to get back to the anchor at the top of pitch 3.\n\nPitch 5 (5.6, 30m) Move left and up towards a blocky corner with a small tree in it, clipping two bolts on the way. Pull up and left around the tree and then continue up towards another larger tree (the small tree can be slung with a runner to provide a little extra protection). Head up the corner/ gully above the larger tree following fairly spaced-out bolts to the anchor on the right-hand side. (In order to walk off, which is recommended, stay roped up and belay the leader up to a suitable tree for an anchor and bring up second. This is easy terrain, but quite exposed, so staying roped up until into the forest is highly recommended!\n\nNote: While this pitch is probably the easiest of the route, it is also the loosest and somewhat run out. Also, while there are rap rings at the top, it is recommended to walk off instead of rappelling this pitch as it would not be a straight-forward rappel. It is likely that it would have to be broken into two rappels, with the second one being off the tree at the base of the final corner/ gully.\n\n \n\nDescent: The route can be rappelled from the top of pitch 4 (see rappel note in pitch 4 description) but if going to the top,  walking off is highly recommended. To walk off, head into forest and until you come to a well-used game trail and follow this trail to the left (west) until you reach a rocky streambed. Head downhill along streambed, through a canyon, and eventually meet up with the original trail in down by the Humber River. Alternatively, instead of taking first game trail, continue through forest until you come to the IATNL Humber Valley (Man in the Mountain) Trail and head left (west) to return to the car park.\n\n\n\nPark at the trailhead for the Man in the Mountain/ Bear Head trail and head up Bear Head trail. Take a right off the Bear Head trail and follow flagging tape through the forest until you come to a white tepee on the far side of a small creek. From the tepee, head up the slope on the right-hand side of the creek, through some boulders, and eventually out onto the talus slope. Head up and left across the talus, aiming for a square bay at the base of the cliff. Locate the bottom anchor on the right-hand side of the square bay.\n\n14 draws and 2 extendable draws"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"5Qo7xfjFWDO2KPDJ3CZtJw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-57.87073,48.95214]}},"createdBy":"Ymbiz6pfUQmgS5FzARzS2A==","_change":{"user":"Ymbiz6pfUQmgS5FzARzS2A==","historyId":"64142c76f0cf00832960ab0e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:01:42.051Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,9275900f-cf51-5bcc-96f3-da7d6efe2e23,b149eef8-f3c5-5fd8-b580-c91900a8ab50,e50a3bc5-f8c5-5833-b628-f0c9dc266d27","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","West Coast","Humber Valley","Man in the Mountain cliff"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-57.87073,48.95214]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"5Qo7xfjFWDO2KPDJ3CZtJw=="},"content":{"description":"Large cliff on north side of the Humber River that has the famous Man in the Mountain face on it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142c76f0cf00832960ab0e","prevHistoryId":"64142c74f0cf00832960ab08","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:01:39.503Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:01:42.063Z","updatedBy":"Ymbiz6pfUQmgS5FzARzS2A=="}
