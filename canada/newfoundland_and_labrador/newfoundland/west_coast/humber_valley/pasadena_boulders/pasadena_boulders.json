Probably one of the warmer climbing spots for Newfoundland due to it being inland and sheltered by a forest. Access is probably year round, weather depend, of course. Although, many people will avoid winter climbing. Best time to climb is May-August. \n  \n The type of rock has seems to elude us. Some of the guys said its very similar to Rumney, New Hampshire. Our best guess is it seems like schist rock. Regardless, The rock quality is very good because the rock is solid, no loose stuff, and it is not sharp. Mostly crimps, pinches and jugs, and scatter slopy dish and pocket. A few cool arete pinchy arete. \n  \n There is 2 larger boulder which are 14 ft in some spots up to 20 ft in some spots. 3 climbable sides on one boulder and 4 (because of a small roof) on the other. The larger boulders are the best because the bigger, but there are also several smaller boulders scatter through the forest which are also climbable. \n  \n Local climbers please let me know if you have any additional information. I would like locals to be involved with the development here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142c78f0cf00832960ab29","prevHistoryId":"64142c77f0cf00832960ab23","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:01:42.512Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:01:43.513Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
