Then the provincial government forcibly re-settled most of the population into larger townships, causing the old ways of life and the old towns of the outports today to die, few remain. \n  \n Known as \"The Rock\" The island is just that, a huge rock jutting from the sea, with many sea cliffs and prominent features especially along it's southern and eastern shores. \n  \n Little explored due to it's remoteness, it contains a treasure of virgin climbing still waiting to be explored."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142c1ef0cf00832960a7e6","prevHistoryId":"64142bd8f0cf00832960a4e3","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:43:12.971Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:43:13.962Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
