The area receives morning sun and the temperature can change dramatically without the sun if the wind is blowing.\n\nA unique feature of the crag is that the boulders at the bottom of the routes shift around from season to season. This can result in unusually high (or low) first bolts on routes. The motion of the boulders also has the effect of rounding off the holds at the bottom of the routes, resulting in a crux at the beginning of many of the routes. A stick clip is mandatory here, and don't hesitate to stick clip the second bolt if ground fall seems likely when climbing past the first.   \n\nWhile a scramble from the trail above exists which can be used to set topropes on routes near Yellow Fever, there is some loose rock present which could be dislodged onto groups below. It is recommended to climb Candy (5.7 sport) to set toprope anchors on routes from MC Hammer to Hysteria, and to climb Spray Down (5.7+ sport) to reach anchors from Flaccid to Seascape."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6414298df0cf008329608cd3","prevHistoryId":"6414298cf0cf008329608cc8","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":84,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:45:53.482Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:49:17.112Z","updatedBy":"e7lp1xEuXjCjo25mTdzbhQ=="}
