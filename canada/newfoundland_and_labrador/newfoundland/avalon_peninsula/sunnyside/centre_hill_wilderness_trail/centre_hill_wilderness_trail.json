The trail starts 8 km from the Trans Canada Highway at the far end of the community and takes you to the top of Centre Hill. From there, you will enjoy a spectacular vista and a glimpse of five different bays. \n  \n The trail takes you across a river and through forest, barrens, and a bakeapple marsh. There is a new bridge at the beginning of the trail, but be prepared for wet spots along the trail. Birds are in abundance and ospreys often nest at the bottom of the hill. You may see a moose. If not, a moose will likely see you. \n  \n The trail is 5 km long – that’s 10 km in all, so plan for half a day. It is moderate most of the way but ends with a strenuous 400-metre climb to the top. \n  \n Source:  sunnysidenl.com/hiking-trails/"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142b37f0cf008329609fb2","prevHistoryId":"64142b35f0cf008329609fac","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:56:19.557Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:56.666Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
