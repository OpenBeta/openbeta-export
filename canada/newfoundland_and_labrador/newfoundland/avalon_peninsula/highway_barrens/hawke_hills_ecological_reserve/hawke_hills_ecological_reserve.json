The area can, in fact, be called the most easterly alpine barrens in North America. \n  \n The reserve is often covered by cold fog moving in off the Atlantic. Its elevation and weather conditions keep the area cool even in summer, which is why the arctic-alpine plants are able to survive here.  \n  \n It is also home to a few boulders. Despite being located near Mandolin, Barrens and others, the Hawke Hill Reserve is considerably colder. It is definitely a late spring early summer location. In contrast, the other climbs in the areas can be a bit hot and humid in summer months."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641429caf0cf008329608ff2","prevHistoryId":"641429c9f0cf008329608fec","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":2,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:50:16.176Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:56.703Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
