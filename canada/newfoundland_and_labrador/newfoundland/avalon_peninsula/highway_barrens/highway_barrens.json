Initial developers of Newfoundland bouldering spent much of their time roaming the Barrens searching for new boulders, however, these boulders have somewhat decreased in popularity in recent years as more oceanside bouldering areas have been discovered with a higher concentration of problems. The boulders are varied in rock type, some are granite which can be quite sharp, and some are a different type of volcanic rock (possibly rhyolite?). Unfortunately, some of the good boulders are far apart, requiring you to re-park the car to access multiple boulders in one session. Nevertheless, classics can be found here, including \"Banjo Chase Music\" V1, \"Rock, Chalk and Two Smoking Holds\" V4, \"Finger Fried\" V6, \"Warlord\" V9 and more."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641429e0f0cf0083296090e6","prevHistoryId":"641429d8f0cf00832960908f","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":11,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:49:58.241Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:56.913Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
