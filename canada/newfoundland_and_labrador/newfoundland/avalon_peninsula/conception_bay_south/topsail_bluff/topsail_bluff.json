Great view out over the bay and towards Bell Island. \n  \n Depending on which trees you choose for a top rope anchor you will need a 70 m rope. If you set your anchors back to far near the upper tree line you will run out of rope. However this is not a problem if you belay from the top. Also, from here you can easily rappel down to the base of the climb.  \n To lead you will probably need a good few screws (8 or so) depending on ice conditions and what you are comfortable with. Some sections may be thin and 10 cm screws may be required.\n\nTopsail Bluff - Main Face\nIce Screws 8 to 10."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"CuXwEUj8WPyzFM91aVeQVw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-52.91408,47.54432]}},"createdBy":"P8AmWNkjVyKkYCf8h8K7pA==","_change":{"user":"P8AmWNkjVyKkYCf8h8K7pA==","historyId":"6414288af0cf00832960830d","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:44:58.300Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,27600501-b93e-5e33-876d-2dfc754b7a4a,d98deff6-5512-5388-8534-ddbe71a4031e,0ae5f011-48fc-58fc-b314-cf7569579057","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","Avalon Peninsula","Conception Bay South","Topsail Bluff"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-52.91408,47.54432]},"bbox":[-52.91474614379137,47.543870339818135,-52.91341385620864,47.544769660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"CuXwEUj8WPyzFM91aVeQVw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-52.91474614379137,47.543870339818135],[-52.91341385620864,47.543870339818135],[-52.91341385620864,47.544769660181856],[-52.91474614379137,47.544769660181856],[-52.91474614379137,47.543870339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"Large face over looking the water.
