This means there are lots of bugs during the summer, but it's a bit warmer during the shoulder season. About 30 well-bolted moderate sport routes exist at Manuels Bluffs, thanks to the hard work of Noel O'Regan. Some harder sport and trad climbing can be found at the Talc Mine."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142887f0cf0083296082fc","prevHistoryId":"6414287ef0cf0083296082a6","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:44:06.777Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:14.945Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
