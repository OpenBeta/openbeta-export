So, I guess these boulders are the 4 kings, and they earn their names. Very big boulder cliffs. Average size is 100 ft long and 14 ft high. \n  \n Well sheltered in the trees. Can climb even in winter minus temps. \n  \n Rock Type is granite. Smooth like swift current not sharp like Mandolin. \n  \n Equal amounts high ball and short problems from 10 ft to just over 20.Just past chapel boulder.  \n  \n Lots of good moderate lines. \n  \n The Chapel, Kings and Extinction boulders are all within 1 KM walk. It is possible to do all in one day. In the area, Kings, chapel and extinction probably 40-50+ problems."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142854f0cf0083296080cf","prevHistoryId":"64142852f0cf0083296080be","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:43:58.212Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:56.637Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
