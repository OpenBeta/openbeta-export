The rock is a fine grained, conglomerate sandstone that results in a large variety of textures and features. There are some harder sport routes, and some easier trad lines over the water that are more commonly soloed than led.\n\nSome of the routes require a stick clip. All top anchors at the crag are accessible safely from above - a good strategy for cleaning routes is to leave an anchor and lower off it then retrieve it from above. Lowering through the bolts will result in a lot of drag, due to their location over the edge. This anchoring choice originated from the antiquated idea that it should be possible to set topropes on routes from above... perhaps the crag should be modernized with anchors on the face, suitable for lowering. \n\nThe wall tends to be cold early in the season due to proximity to the ocean but is very well sheltered from ocean swells. It stays in the shade for most of the day, so it makes a great place to go on a summer afternoon or evening."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142a08f0cf008329609321","prevHistoryId":"64142a07f0cf008329609317","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:51:14.145Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:51:20.561Z","updatedBy":"MX2BIDZmWdOZRHi7jj3UcA=="}
