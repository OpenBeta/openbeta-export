The rock is best in the Logy Bay area, which is home to some excellent bouldering at the Marine Lab, as well as some short sport routes, all of which have 5-10 minute approaches. On the lower-quality rock in Middle Cove, there is some excellent ice climbing and a small bouldering wall on the west side of the beach."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142a41f0cf0083296094df","prevHistoryId":"64142a09f0cf00832960932b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:51:11.980Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:56.596Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
