Most of the climbing is significantly easier than 5.7 with a couple of crux moves which are close to the bolts. The moves are fun, and although it is not an instant classic this would be a great spot to get a taste of multipitch or work on your skills. \n  \n From the top you can either rap back to the base or top out and take the established hiking trail all the way back down. \n  \n The rock on the route is solid but there is still some moss and dirt which we will be working to clean a little more. Some traffic will do it the world of good!\n\nFrom the main trail go straight into the face when you can see it around 20 feet from the trail through the bushes. From the anchor on top a short incredibly easy walk up and left gets you to the lookout and the top of the hiking trail.\n1st Pitch - 5 bolts - 31m <br /> 2nd Pitch - 4 bolts - 30m <br /> Both pitches have 2 bolt rap anchors. <br />  <br /> Be careful to knot your ends when lowering and rappelling as they can both be done with a 60m rope but it is incredibly close!"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"t6Awd2aDWtai+sgFvkQTyw==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-53.10119,47.42007]}},"createdBy":"e7lp1xEuXjCjo25mTdzbhQ==","_change":{"user":"e7lp1xEuXjCjo25mTdzbhQ==","historyId":"641429f7f0cf00832960926f","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:51:03.407Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,27600501-b93e-5e33-876d-2dfc754b7a4a,a107a17e-b359-5c5d-9d69-70e116d96777,b7a03077-6683-5ad6-a2fa-c805be4413cb","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","Avalon Peninsula","Holyrood","Murray's Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-53.10119,47.42007]},"bbox":[-53.101854570151886,47.41962033981815,-53.10052542984811,47.42051966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"t6Awd2aDWtai+sgFvkQTyw=="},"content":{"description":"A big, low angled face with potential for several easy routes.
