Behind the boulders is a sandstone conglomerate cliff face that is about 500 ft long and 15ft to 40ft high and overhung 20-35 degrees. The rock seems solid. It is currently unbolted, but there is potential for a short sport crag with maybe 10+ routes. Short sections of this face have potential for additional boulder problems. \n  \n The Rainforest Boulders: \n  \n These boulders are some of the best I have seen in Eastern Newfoundland ! What makes these boulders special is they have overhanging problems which at the time of writing are not common on the Avalon. Definitely, some classic quality problems on these ! A must visit. In addition, there is a high concentration of problems compared to other areas. Potential for moderate overhanging sport routes on the cliff behind too ! \n  \n Rain forest boulders are in a wooded area protected from the wind. A great winter bouldering spot (Oct-May) as on a sunny day it feels warm and protects from the wind. From May to October, the bugs will probably be bad depending on how warm its been. \n  \n The Rainforest Cliff: \n  \n Potential for 20ft-45ft easy to moderate overhanging sport crag. No bolts as of this writing. There also looks like 3-4 short trad lines."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"V2pJ55TSV3qHGhuCXIk92A==","historyId":"641429faf0cf008329609284","prevHistoryId":"641429f8f0cf008329609279","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:51:04.161Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:51:06.215Z","updatedBy":"V2pJ55TSV3qHGhuCXIk92A=="}
