Traditionally, the main wall in Holyrood has been a training ground for trad climbers, with many trad routes ranging from 5.3 to 5.9. Recently, some moderate multi-pitch climbs of 2-3 pitches have been developed, on Murray's Peak and the main wall. There are some good bouldering opportunities at Wong's House and at the seldom-visited Rainforest."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"641429fbf0cf00832960928a","prevHistoryId":"641429f8f0cf008329609279","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:50:49.764Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:13:14.686Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
