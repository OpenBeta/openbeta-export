We were watching whales and spotting icebergs. I thought it was so awesome that the sea was so blue and vast. She said \"Hey Look at that. The ocean; the ocean is the world. Water covers most of the earth's surface. We're biased towards the land because it is our home and our experience - but the land is only The Exception. We're the exception. That makes us very special\". \n  \n This problem is on honor of Jessie. \n and she was also \"The Exception\". She was very special indeed.  \n  \n Sit start on a jug and a hand foot match. Go out right to two sharp crimps. Out right again to a large sloping jug. Mantle from the jug to topout the boulder. Caution the challenge of the climb is not dabbing on the ground as the problem is so low.\n\nOn the larger boulder off the north head trail. When looking at the ocean it is the left side on the corner. The jug and toe placement should look clear. To get down jump onto the ground or go down the slabby back side.\nHonestly theres not really much room for a pad. If you can fit one in its recommended. Spotter is nice."},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"4pYSQLT3UhuBm7AQwQcwaA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-52.69043,47.5951]}},"createdBy":"i2w9kMFSU2OwkM6CvLMsPw==","_change":{"user":"i2w9kMFSU2OwkM6CvLMsPw==","historyId":"64142b23f0cf008329609f12","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:56:03.636Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,27600501-b93e-5e33-876d-2dfc754b7a4a,6b71de1b-75ec-5132-82a5-2f9181fbe30d,6a93c09f-5ac6-5a8d-b632-8e5da18e7e54,e2961240-b4f7-521b-819b-b010c1073068","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","Avalon Peninsula","St John's Area","Signal Hill (North Head Trail)","Large boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"v1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-52.69043,47.5951]},"bbox":[-52.69109678997676,47.594650339818145,-52.68976321002323,47.59554966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"4pYSQLT3UhuBm7AQwQcwaA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-52.69109678997676,47.594650339818145],[-52.68976321002323,47.594650339818145],[-52.68976321002323,47.59554966018187],[-52.69109678997676,47.59554966018187],[-52.69109678997676,47.594650339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"Sunny usually.
