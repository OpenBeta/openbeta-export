From 10 to 16 feet. Some are in a stream but we are working on building landings to place pads so they wont get wet. \n  \n Shade. No wind. Sandstone conglomerate. The rock is pebbly sandstone, so many people prefer the smooth sandstone of blackhead to rock here.  \n  \n Good when its not warm. Buggy when warm. Also worth mentioning that the freshwater bay, leamy pond, and gunnar cove boulders are across the road, and can be all climbed in one day. That makes this area fairly concentrated. \n  \n In regard to rock quality, I personally just think its difference to climb on and wouldn't call it poor quality. The pebbles change the style of climbing which can be good. The rock is solid though."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"V2pJ55TSV3qHGhuCXIk92A==","historyId":"64142b0cf0cf008329609e3b","prevHistoryId":"64142b0bf0cf008329609e30","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:55:39.646Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:13.712Z","updatedBy":"V2pJ55TSV3qHGhuCXIk92A=="}
