The swell plays a big factor on the route as the approach is close to the water line.  \n  \n In any event, climb the crack past a hole, through a squeeze chimney/roof section then up easier flakes to the top. Offwidth technique and laybacking are useful at various points. \n  \n Once you bring your second up, you can unrope and climb 3rd class ledges rightwards for a long ways until it feels safe to scramble up to the main trail.\n\nTo the right of the main Gut Wall, there is a very wide, arching crack up a slightly positive wall.\nProtects pretty well. Sparse rack to #3 camalot, 1x #4, #5, #6 Camalots and a blue Big Bro. The blue big bro could be replaced by a very tipped out number 6 Camalot and supplemented by a small nut a few feet below. Lots of anchor opportunities, I used a #1 and .75 camalot and a pink tricam immediately above the climb.  <br />  <br /> Bring lots of long slings and bump your #6"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"pYwisACHUf+emaTDC9CpPA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-52.6689,47.5823]}},"createdBy":"MX2BIDZmWdOZRHi7jj3UcA==","_change":{"user":"MX2BIDZmWdOZRHi7jj3UcA==","historyId":"64142b1df0cf008329609ed5","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:55:57.134Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,27600501-b93e-5e33-876d-2dfc754b7a4a,6b71de1b-75ec-5132-82a5-2f9181fbe30d,3ca14bb9-1bb3-5080-bce6-874c86b39f0b,a58c22b0-0087-51ff-9e99-a4c30bd0a93c","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","Avalon Peninsula","St John's Area","Quidi Vidi","The Gut"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-52.6689,47.5823]},"bbox":[-52.669566626926745,47.58185033981813,-52.66823337307324,47.58274966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"pYwisACHUf+emaTDC9CpPA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-52.669566626926745,47.58185033981813],[-52.66823337307324,47.58185033981813],[-52.66823337307324,47.58274966018185],[-52.669566626926745,47.58274966018185],[-52.669566626926745,47.58185033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"Despite being close to town this area feels very remote and has good rock with face climbing and finger cracks that become overhanging towards the top.
