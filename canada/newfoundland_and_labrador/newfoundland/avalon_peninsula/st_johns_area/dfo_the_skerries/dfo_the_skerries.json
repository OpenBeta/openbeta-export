Contains the highest concentration of climbs within the city limits. Don't be fooled by its proximity to town, it has a nice remote feeling. The area overlooks a scenic section of the coast with a view of Cape Spear in the distance and is a great a place to spot whales. The sun rises over the ocean and stays on the wall until late afternoon (its not hot here, the sun is welcomed!). Chances are you'll have the place all to yourself! There is no cell reception at the crags and you'll have to hike about 15 minutes back along the approach to get reception, so plan accordingly."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142ac2f0cf008329609ad3","prevHistoryId":"64142abcf0cf008329609a90","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:53:59.360Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:54:00.930Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
