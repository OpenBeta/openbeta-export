All climbs are fully bolted and moderate in difficulty. There is potential for a few more easier sport routes on the chossier left end of the wall but they will require some cleaning. Bring a stick clip or be prepared to make one using a stick, as the first bolts are high on some routes. All top anchors are positioned for lowering, not setting topropes from above. As with the other DFO walls there is no cell reception, so plan accordingly as the nearest reception is 15-20 minutes back along the approach."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142aaff0cf0083296099d8","prevHistoryId":"64142aaff0cf0083296099ce","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":5,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:54:01.957Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:54:07.894Z","updatedBy":"MX2BIDZmWdOZRHi7jj3UcA=="}
