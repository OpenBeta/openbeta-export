Never actually been there. I am not 100% sure but i think they are talking about Rose Blanche-Harbour Lecou relatively near Port aux Basque. Its a shot in the dark but if anyones in the area maybe they can check it out.Looks like some pretty high coastal bouldering. Probably windy. Very Secluded. Rock type is probably Granite from what I know about that general area. Rock quality looks okay. Check around the coast of the town Rose Blanche. Probably there somewhere. see video:  vimeo.com/1917865"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"V2pJ55TSV3qHGhuCXIk92A==","historyId":"64142be5f0cf00832960a546","prevHistoryId":"64142be3f0cf00832960a53b","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:59:15.993Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:21.450Z","updatedBy":"V2pJ55TSV3qHGhuCXIk92A=="}
