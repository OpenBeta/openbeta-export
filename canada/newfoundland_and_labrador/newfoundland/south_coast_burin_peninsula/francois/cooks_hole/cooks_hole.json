The first pitch is excellent, and the next two are easier but good climbing up surprisingly moderate rock. The whole climb is well protected.  \n\nP1, 5.10a, 30m: climb obvious corner-flake feature 5 feet right of the hole in the cliff. Continue straight up a short layback crack to a bolt, which protects some insecure face climbing (crux) straight up to a ledge. Continue easily right and up to a 2 bolt rappel anchor. The climbing on this pitch is excellent, and would make a nice single pitch objective after the ferry gets in.\n\nP2, 5.8, 30m: there are two left-facing corners above the belay. Climb the corner on the right for 3m until the climbing gets more difficult, then step left to the other corner using good holds. Climb this corner past a hollow but seemingly solid flake until you are standing on top of the flake. Traverse right along the top of the flake, then continue up and right into another obvious dihedral. Continue up this corner past a short steep section that brings you back left to a gear belay stance with good cracks. Use long slings and don't forget to protect your second!\n\nP3, 5.7, 30m: Follow obvious vertical cracks with great holds and gear to a big ledge with blueberry bushes. Belay here (gear belay) or link with the next easy pitch.\n\nP4, easy 5th, 15+m: Follow any of the obvious paths up and belay off gear near the phone tower. I went up the slab above the belay, but an ugly chimney option also exists...\n\nDescend by continuing east for less than 100m until you intersect with the painted yellow trail blazes marking the Friar Trail, and continue along the trail southwards to town, passing close to the base of the cliff. Should take about 20 minutes to get from the top to the base of the cliff if you find the trail quickly.\n\n1m right of the big hole in the cliff. \nStandard rack from 00 mastercam to #4 camalot, may want to double up on finger to hand sized pieces for belays"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"M18ytjnaXzausUvGMQDHJA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-56.74911,47.58104]}},"createdBy":"MX2BIDZmWdOZRHi7jj3UcA==","_change":{"user":"MX2BIDZmWdOZRHi7jj3UcA==","historyId":"64142be1f0cf00832960a516","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:59:13.050Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,ad242f45-6f47-5398-bb53-d5cc5ab390df,03e75723-5576-5f55-8f29-716182195d44,427ab0cd-5f70-55b9-9261-81615bdc843b,91ff924f-f833-599b-96cd-75d9fb6873b2,335f32b6-39da-5f36-aeb1-4bc63100c724","pathTokens":["Canada","Newfoundland and Labrador","Newfoundland","South Coast / Burin Peninsula","Francois","Cook's Hole"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-56.74911,47.58104]},"bbox":[-180,-90,180,90],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"M18ytjnaXzausUvGMQDHJA=="},"content":{"description":"Cook's Hole is a 300 - 350 ft high cliff and probably has the shortest approach of all the viable crags in Francois. It is easy to identify as it has a phone tower at the top. A well-maintained hiking trail leads to the base of the wall, ending at a narrow, wet cave in the middle of the cliff. While the cliff does not have the height of the cliffs in other bays nearby, the rock quality is good and a number of possible lines exist, from single pitch cragging to short multipitch. I have added some pictures of the various faces of that show possible lines, as well as the line I climbed, which could be a nice objective for those itching to climb a pitch or 3 before heading to Devil's Bay the next day."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142be1f0cf00832960a516","prevHistoryId":"64142be0f0cf00832960a510","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T08:59:11.007Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-17T08:59:13.055Z","updatedBy":"MX2BIDZmWdOZRHi7jj3UcA=="}
