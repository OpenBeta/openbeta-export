It comprises the mainland portion of the province, separated from the island of Newfoundland by the Strait of Belle Isle. It is the largest and northernmost geographical region in Atlantic Canada. \n  \n Labrador occupies the eastern section of the Labrador Peninsula, in an area roughly the same size as the US state of Colorado. It is bordered to the west and the south by the Canadian province of Quebec. Labrador also shares a small land border with the Canadian territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island. \n  \n Though Labrador is over twice as large in area as the island of Newfoundland, it is home to only 6% of the provinces population. These people include the Inuit, Innu and Métis Aboriginal groups, as well as generations of European immigrants known as Settlers. \n                          -Wikipedia \n  \n \"The Land God Gave to Cain\" - Jaques Cartier \n  \n Labrador is rugged and barren.
