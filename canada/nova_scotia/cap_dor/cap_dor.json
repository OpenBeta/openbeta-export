They were thwarted by a massive ice umbrella that proved impossible to climb through or around. In December of 2018 Max and Luc returned with Michel Martin to give it another go. They climbed almost half of the route before deciding to bail due to poor ice conditions. On the descent, very near the bottom Michel took a short fall while trying to retrieve the rope. He unfortunately broke his foot/ankle quite badly when he hit the ground. Despite the broken foot but with the help of Max and Luc, Michel was able to get off the beach and back to the car just in time as the tide was fast approaching. Michel needed two surgeries and 6 months to recover from his injury but was determined to climb again. A little more than 13 months from the day of the accident Michel returned with Luc and Marty Levesque to try once again to climb this line. This time they were successful and were happy to find good ice, challenging climbing and a route worth the effort.

All of the routes are found along the coast on a finger of land that juts out into the Bay of Fundy. The bay holds has some of the highest tides in the world so access to the beach and the base of the routes can be complicated. Plan your climbing here based on the low tide time. A low tide time of between 11 am and 1 pm is best. Most of the development has occurred on the west side of the land feature that makes up Cap d'Or. Here you will find routes looking very much like alpine climbs in the rockies. This section faces mostly southwest so you will be mostly in the sun in the afternoon hours. This combined with a fickle marine climate make the climbing season here relatively short.
