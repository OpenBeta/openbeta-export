Be careful to not get lured too far left of the bolts through this two-time crux - you'll be rewarded with a home run jug to clip off of if you stay on route.

Work your way through a series of bulges, flakes, dishes, corners and a variety of other features. There are two distinct cruxes but the rest is fairly sustained as well. The top rewards you with a comfortable belay ledge and a set of rings, along with a fantastic view of the arena. -\n\nHere are some early reviews for Champions Club:\n\n'One of the most unique climbs I've ever done. A real technical and mental test piece for the grade.' - G.H.\n\n'Even while seconding pitch two on top rope, I almost soiled myself with vomit. I'll never climb this pitch again.The first pitch was cool, though.' - T. F. \n\n*This route was first climbed with just 11 bolts. Since the fa more bolts have been added to improve protection.\n\n\n\nThis route starts right in front of the Observatory, which is the aptly-named ledge feature that juts out into the valley. Look for three bolts trending left up a large flake feature before going straight up through the overhanging section. \n\nYou can rap from the top in two raps with a 60m rope. \n\n\nA mixture of 15 sport and alpine quickdraws.

Follow bolts up the ramp and pull some fun moves around the two bulges. It would be helpful to extend the two bolts before the bulge to reduce rope drag later. About 35 meters to the first belay ledge. Pitch two, 20 meters up exposed but easier climbing to a second set of rings. An optional third pitch goes up then right across a ledge system.

The climbing is never too hard but still quite thought provoking. Other than pitch 3 this is a sport climb! Only quickdraws needed for pitches 1,2 and 4. A very light rack of cams up to #1 BD are needed for pitch 3. \n\nPitch 1 - Climb up large holds and big features to a tricky crux. Pull onto a sloping ledge where you will find a two bolt anchor and belay. 18 meters 6 bolts 5.10a\n\nPitch 2 - Step right off the anchor and head up on more good rock. Follow the weakness as it winds left and right several times before reaching a big ledge and bolted belay. 25 meters, 9 bolts, 5.8\n\nPitch 3 - If you brought a light rack of trad gear you can do this pitch. If you didn't you should rappel back to the ground. Step right across the ledge and aim for a low angle slab with several cracks. Move up the slab then start making an airy, exposed, horizontal traverse, clipping one bolt through a run out section. More gear will be found after the bolt as you continue moving right. Step down and aim for a narrow foot ledge that leads to a bolted belay. Make a few spicy moves across the foot ledge before clipping the anchor. 20 meters, 1 bolt, 5.6\n\nPitch 4 - This is the money pitch. Follow the incredibly featured, steep and intriguing dike as it flows up to a ledge. Move up and right off the ledge climbing a large flake that will take you to the top of the pitch and another bolted belay. 22 meters, 9 bolts, 5.8.\n\nGear: For pitch 1, 2 and 4 a mix of 10 draws of varying lengths will suffice. For pitch 3 a light trad rack of cams from small to a 1 inch piece. 6 cams would be plenty. 60 meter rope would be fine. Rap the route. If you do pitch 3 and 4 you will need to walk about 40 meters along the base to get back to your packs. \n\n\n\nThis route is roughly in the middle of wall. To find the start take the approach trail that leads to the base of the wall. Head down a gully with a fixed rope. About 30 meters below the fixed line you will see an obvious dike with dark rock and blocky features. This is the start of the first pitch. \n\n\nMostly bolts, small rack for pitch 3. Bolted belays.
