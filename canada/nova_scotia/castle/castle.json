It is predominantly short single pitch sport climbing with low exposure. It is in the woods and can get very buggy when the bugs are out. Despite the new and short nature of the cliff it has some very good climbing. It has quickly become popular with those new to the sport owing to its low exposure, short routes, and concentration of easy and moderate climbs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142ed8f0cf00832960c488","prevHistoryId":"64142ed2f0cf00832960c46a","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":7,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:11:08.922Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:57.851Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
