As it is now I wouldn't even recommend that the last pitch be repeated. The best course of action is to rap off after the first 3 pitches which are very high quality.\nPitch 1 - A steep, broad curtain of ice leads to a lower angled ramp. Follow this to the next steeper part on the left.  About 50 meters. WI4+\nPitch 2 - Climb the 70 degree column of ice to a loose section of rock. Move left to find screws for a belay. 45 meters. WI3 \nPitch 3 - Depending on where you belayed move to regain the line heading up to a good sections of ice interspersed with decent quality rock. Follow thin ice and rock to a short vertical to overhanging section of ice. There will be an opportunity for some screws but not many. Climb the steep part then follow a good ice ramp to a solid screw anchor belay. 45 meter WI4+ M5\nPitch 4 - This pitch starts out with a wonderful steep section of ice but then changes to a chossy 20 meters of rock to the tree anchor and top out. 35 meters. WI3+ M5 R.\n\nThis route is found about 500 meters east of Shore Thing.  If you are travelling west from The Chains area this will be the second small cove containing several ice routes. A 25 meter, steep, obvious broad curtain of ice will be very visible from the beach. This is the start.\nA rack of screws, maybe a couple of pins and light rock rack. "},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"PLEiw8PJXSmopCxJc1yd8A==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-64.8839,45.3448]}},"createdBy":"b91PKkSHXHSZuhalO8QQRA==","_change":{"user":"b91PKkSHXHSZuhalO8QQRA==","historyId":"64142e82f0cf00832960c1c7","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:10:26.163Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"2996145f-e1ba-5b56-9da8-30c64ccc3776,79030ef1-1f18-536f-9f60-6b4ea0526b2e,493540b6-7ddb-5b19-83df-eba36d1018bf,3cb122c3-c3c9-5d29-a8a4-2c49735c9df0","pathTokens":["Canada","Nova Scotia","Cape Chignecto Ice","Cozy Warm Area Ice"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":5,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"alpine":{"total":5,"bands":{"unknown":5,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":5,"bands":{"unknown":5,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":5,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-64.8839,45.3448]},"bbox":[-64.88453977720134,45.34435033981815,-64.88326022279865,45.345249660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"","area_id":"PLEiw8PJXSmopCxJc1yd8A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-64.88453977720134,45.34435033981815],[-64.88326022279865,45.34435033981815],[-64.88326022279865,45.345249660181864],[-64.88453977720134,45.345249660181864],[-64.88453977720134,45.34435033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the last area of climbing before Refugee Cove.
