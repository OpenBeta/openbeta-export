Development of ice climbing began in 2014 and has been happening ever since. Each year several new routes are put up. Very view climbers have ventured into this area but hopefully that will change in the future. Access is simple. Drive to the park entrance. Leave your car in the parking lot and walk the beach westward from the visitor center. The climbing season is relatively short due to the southern aspect of the cliffs. The very best time to climb is from mid December to mid January but if it stays cold you could climb much later than that. Whatever month of winter you are there you will need a window of at least 5 days of consistent cold weather with temps from -5 and below to have enough ice to make the routes climbable. Cloudy and overcast days are best."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"64142e8ef0cf00832960c24d","prevHistoryId":"64142e86f0cf00832960c20a","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","__v":8,"createdAt":"2023-03-17T09:09:58.616Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:22.794Z","updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
