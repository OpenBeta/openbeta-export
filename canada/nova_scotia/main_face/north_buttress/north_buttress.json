Long and involved pitch with amazing exposure and thought provoking moves. Not a continuous crack climb - You can't really sew this thing up, and there are a few easy runouts- but there is bomber gear where you really need it- I would call it PG. Use a tree after topping out or plug a piece or two and run out the 5.4 slab to the meatgrinder rings. Awesome line that deserves way more traffic. \n\n\n\nRap from meatgrinder with a 70m rope to get to the very bottom, one ledge system below the start of meatgrinder. Climb the ramp into the corner and up to the rings you just rapped from. \n\n.4- #2, #4 optional for cams, one set of nuts,  lots of slings to extend pieces on the traverse or you will suffer serious rope drag on the upper part of the climb"},"metadata":{"left_right_index":-1,"areaRef":"lOVmhwWmVSK19iyI2qKtuA==","lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-63.1707,44.80654]}},"createdBy":"BwWIo+P8WCSCHNCn/PEmng==","_change":{"user":"BwWIo+P8WCSCHNCn/PEmng==","historyId":"64142ffdf0cf00832960d125","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"updatedAt":"2023-03-17T09:16:45.547Z"},{"_id":"9f/F0arCS+eRO/f+I5+Ecg==","name":"Mainline","grades":{"yds":"5.8"},"type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"gradeContext":"US","fa":"Chris Dale et al, Sep 2 1978","length":42,"content":{"description":"Pitch 1 * (5.8, 20m): At the right side of the face, climb easy ground (trending left) to reach a series of steep vertical cracks in a corner.
