Stick clip is a good idea if 10c is your limit. The rest of the first pitch is about 10a/ 5.9 with good rests and great movement, and cool positions. Follow bolts to two ring anchor at obvious ledge.\n\nP2: goes at about 5.8 up the crazy white streak and has some great exposed climbing, one of the nicest positions to be in climbing in NS . There's a small runout near the top, laybacking up a slab using a juggy flake. Could take a cam or two, 0.5-1 BD if wanted. But not necessary if you feel solid at 5.10. Climb ends at a two ring anchor under the railing.\n\n One of the best 5.10's in NS, doesn't get enough hype! \n\n\n\nObvious white streak in the middle of the crag.\n\nP1-G, P2- PG.
