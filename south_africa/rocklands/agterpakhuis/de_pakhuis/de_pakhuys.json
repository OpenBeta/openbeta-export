The pass reaches an altitude of 905 m and connects [Clanwilliam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clanwilliam,_South_Africa) to [Calvinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinia). It was improved in the 1960s and tarred in 2009. In December 1946, a plane crashed into the nearby Pakhuis Peak, killing everyone on board - The site of the wreckage can still be walked to. The pass features many important San rock paintings, and a handful of popular hiking routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"+m3LyybQSAeRwtnu+I7Sog==","historyId":"641d867531d93a51e2e7d967","prevHistoryId":"641c3c7428dd56df7e259d33","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"+m3LyybQSAeRwtnu+I7Sog==","__v":4,"createdAt":"2023-02-17T12:04:47.794Z","updatedAt":"2023-03-23T07:21:24.464Z","updatedBy":"+m3LyybQSAeRwtnu+I7Sog=="}
