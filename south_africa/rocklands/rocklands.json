It is located about 250km from Cape Town, on the edge of the Cederberg Mountains.\n\nThe area is known for its abundance of bright-orange sandstone boulders. Boulderers have frequented Rocklands since 1996, when Todd Skinner, Fred Nicole, and others began documenting bouldering routes in the area.\n\n## Access\n\nNo climbing is allowed in Rocklands without a valid climbing permit. Land owners and Cape Nature rangers often conduct inspections in the climbing areas and anyone found without a permit will be asked to leave the climbing area.
