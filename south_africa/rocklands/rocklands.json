It is located about 250km from Cape Town, on the edge of the Cederberg Mountains.\n\nThe area is known for its abundance of bright-orange sandstone boulders. Boulderers have frequented Rocklands since 1996, when Todd Skinner, Fred Nicole, and others began documenting bouldering routes in the area.\n\n## Access\n\nNo climbing is allowed in Rocklands without a valid climbing permit. Land owners and Cape Nature rangers often conduct inspections in the climbing areas and anyone found without a permit will be asked to leave the climbing area. Permits can be obtained online - [Quicket](https://www.quicket.co.za/events/4582-rocklands-bouldering-permit/#/) - or purchased at [CapeNature's Kliphuis campsite office](https://www.capenature.co.za/accommodation/kliphuis-camping), [De Pakhuys campsite office](https://www.depakhuys.com), or [Traveller's Rest](https://www.travellersrest.co.za/)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"+m3LyybQSAeRwtnu+I7Sog==","historyId":"651fc841c4a448cde97d11c8","prevHistoryId":"642f9baafbd9321d4815947c","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"__v":4,"createdAt":"2022-12-03T08:50:24.886Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:55:13.925Z","updatedBy":"+m3LyybQSAeRwtnu+I7Sog=="}
