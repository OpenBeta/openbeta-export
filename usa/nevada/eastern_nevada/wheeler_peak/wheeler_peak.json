One of his efforts resulted in a route on the spectacular NE face of Wheeler Peak, which is recorded in Michael Kelsey's guidebook \"Hiking and Climbing in the Great Basin National Park\". I thought I'd provide some information and credit to Wade Mills on this. The route ascends the main face, starting near the center, then up to center right, then diagonaling across the upper face to just left of the high point of the peak. Mills made the solo first ascent on June 19, 1977 and called the route \"Stella by Starlight.\" He rated it 5.8,A3+,Ice 9. He found no signs of previous activity on the wall and left nothing behind himself. The Kelsey guidebook description states, in part: \"Mills began with a Class 4 snow and ice climb of 100 meters to a ramp. He started left, turned to the right, then traversed under a water gully with ice on top. He then climbed the wall next to the gully (left side) which had some running water. This was 60 meters, which he rated between 5.5 and 5.8. He then went left to what he calls \"a thin ledge -- open book\" at 4.0 - 5.5. Above, he went up some overhangs - with aid, which were wet. He made two pitches on thin horizontal holds at 5.8. He finally got onto a long ramp angling up to the left. This ramp fades in places and had ice all over. After many pitches, he got off the face just below the summit. Mills mentions there was some rockfall early on the climb when the sun first hit the face but that ice was hard in the cracks in the upper face....\"    The Kelsey guide contains a photo showing the route with the references to the route description, gear list, and other information.","protection":"See route description and \"Hiking and Climbing in the Great Basin National Park\" by Michael Kelsey.

This channel appeared from below to be covered with ice but was in fact a series of down sloping edges frosted in a variable mixture of snice, snow and rotten ice.  My scratching picks failed to uncover even so much as a seam for a knife blade.  The angle was 75 to 85 degrees with short sections of  90. Gear was poor to non-existent until a shallow slot for a number 3 materialized under some snow near the end of the difficulties. At one point I was 50 feet out on a #4 wire half in a shallow, bottoming out crack.  After the lead I felt this pitch in the condition I found it warranted an M6 X grade  The belay at its conclusion was made from two too small knifeblades and a tipped out #2. (note: After examining our photos we believe this pitch could be avoided, in the right conditions, by traversing right at approximately mid-height of the pitch and heading for the crease between a rock tower on the left and the main NE. face on the right.  It appears (?) that this could yield easier ground, but we could not see into the crease and so cannot comment directly).\n\n Pitch 4 was one of the easier pitches.  It leads right on steep snow from the belay and then up a snow ramp to the main NE face wall itself.  A decent belay can be constructed in relatively solid rock below the prominent ice bulge leading up into the NE Couloir itself.\n\n Pitch 5 started out with some easy snow traversing toward the main ice bulge.  The ice we found here was WI3 and fat enough to take screws comfortably.  Rather than belay in the exposed position at the top of the bulge (we’d seen large chunks of ice flying over the top of the bulge), we simu-climbed up another 60 m from the top of the ice.  The climbing was steepish snow, gradually trending rightward to avoid a deep gully cut by sliding and falling debris from the upper couloir itself.  Belay was at the toe of a loose rock buttress that split the couloir proper.\n\n Pitch 6 was another relatively easy section of steep snow climbing upward toward the final mixed section leading to the summit ridge.  This pitch is however heavily exposed to falling debris from the summit cornices and the walls of the couloir. In addition, the runnel in the center is to be avoided as it periodically sluices a heavy mix of snow and rubble.\n\n Pitch 7 was a shorty to move the belay into a crack in the right wall of the terminal end of the NE Couloir itself.  The belay was solid, but the position was awful.  Surrounded from above on all sides by snow mushrooms, icicles and loose rock, it is not a place in which I’d recommend spending much time. A constant waterfall of icy slush poured down on me and at the end I was soaked to the skin.\n\n Pitch 8 was the second and final crux of the route.  Immediately before starting we were hit by a large shush-a-lanche which rattled us into a “let’s get the hell out of here” posture.  While it appeared from earlier sketchy trip reports that parties who found the route dry exited up the right wall/buttress of the couloir, we decided that was out of the question.  There were simply too many giant hanging icicles and other nasty things above us.  Instead we elected to step across the now-narrow couloir and start up a short mixed face below a car-sized mushroom of snow. The climbing required Scott to do a huge amount of excavation and some very delicate hooking while trying not the think about the mushroom poised above.  At the mushroom, the pitch turned right and headed up a faint buttress that appeared to be nothing more than a pile of stacked plates for 30-40 feet.  It is the single loosest section of rock I’ve ever encountered anywhere and I’m still not sure how it was holding together.  Scott capped this brilliant lead with an actual Scottish-style tunnel through the summit cornice to arrive at the safe and flat summit ridge.  Scott says the pitch is probably M5/M5+ R. I say X. Doesn’t matter. Its just spooky.\n\n On the entire route I believe we saw one fixed pin.  There are no fixed belays and retreat by rapping above pitch two would be very challenging and potentially dangerous.\n\n We topped out at 4:30 in the afternoon.  The descent was uneventful and safe even in the afternoon sun. We arrived back at the car around 4 hours later.\n\n This is one of the best alpine mixed routes I’ve done in the lower 48. If you're looking for a real alpine climb with some serious technical sections at higher altitude, and you don’t mind a bit of an approach, this gem is indeed the Wheel Deal.","protection":"rack of cams, set of wires, 3 short screws, selection of 3-4 thin pins.","location":"The obvious line on the NE face of Wheeler Peak"},"__v":0},{"_id":"J9S6KcGlUZSD0lgVx37Hmw==","name":"Hit by a Wheeler aka the Marvell-Wharton","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"Jackson Marvell and Josh Wharton 3/15/21","type":{"trad":true,"mixed":true,"alpine":true,"bouldering":true},"safety":"X","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.31392,38.98578]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"120550216","mp_crag_id":"105972685","climb_id":"J9S6KcGlUZSD0lgVx37Hmw==","areaRef":"fsLAA4axX4yh8OAq6WtiWg=="},"content":{"description":"I believe this was the first route up the central portion of Wheeler's northeast face, and probably also the first time Wheeler's northeast face was climbed in winter.

The route follows the obvious thin ramp that slashes though the middle of the wall. The crux is a couple of steeper pitches in the middle portion, but expect engaging climbing throughout.
