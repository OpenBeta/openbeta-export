It has a “serenade” very similar to the whistling call of an elk and likes to perch on rock towers and pinnacles.","protection":"Standard rack of nuts and cams to 4.5 inches.","location":"See Location of Crooked Finger Tower.

It’s clearly visible from the valley below while driving along the Great Basin Highway (US 93). It appears as a leaning or crooked “thumb” of the much larger Chimney Rock immediately to the east.
