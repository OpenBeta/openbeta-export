The Puppy, a large obvious pillar at the south end of the cliff line, has a cool overhang and a nice looking dihedral, awaiting routes. Other cracks and a cool pinnacle await. You have to hunt for the better boulders, but there are some nice ones with steep faces or overhangs, and quality rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:25.968Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:13.444Z"}
