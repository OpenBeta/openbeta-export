We went pretty much went straight up the slab at the bottom (we placed two bolts), then into a thin crack which became harder (crux is 20 feet up the crack), then easier higher up.\n\n There was an old anchor on top, likely for the large chimney / crack to the right of our route. I put in a new two bolt ringed anchor at the top of this route. \n\n We didn't walk off, but this is such a large bulky formation that it seems possible. So also possible to scramble up and use top anchors for a top rope for this and the much harder roof climb to the left.","protection":"Two bolts then trad gear","location":"Steep east face of large spire.  From Elephant Head arch, head uphill and pass one big bulky broken-up spire then you'll see this one.\n\n GPS 40.575 -119.992"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a31fb323-0db7-5e02-b522-f21d3b49b531,9445f336-4fc5-5f06-b386-9dcec24fd7a1,99715975-2efb-534c-adca-4fb9566f89f1,9d92b9bb-b144-565f-b495-9168508909a9","pathTokens":["USA","Nevada","Western Nevada","Elephant Land (aka The Lava Beds)","\"Lava Lightning\" Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.00296,40.58431]},"bbox":[-119.00355208701671,40.583860339818145,-119.00236791298329,40.58475966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116562512","area_id":"nZK5u7FEVl+0lZFoUIkJqQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.00355208701671,40.583860339818145],[-119.00236791298329,40.583860339818145],[-119.00236791298329,40.58475966018187],[-119.00355208701671,40.58475966018187],[-119.00355208701671,40.583860339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"Enter a description of this area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:29.302Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:17.949Z"}
