Belay at a semi-hanging two-bolt belay. 5.8, 30m, 12 bolts.Pitch #3: Straight up through yet again another wondrous pocketed section, then trend left following bolts and a bit of moss to the two-bolt belay at the \"Giant Scoop\". 5.7, 30m, 13 bolts.Pitch #4: Continue up the arete for a few 5.8 thin moves and turn the corner to much easier (5.5) pocketed lower angle climbing. The holds are huge! Pass the two-bolt belay to a giant ledge and essentially the end of the climbing, Two bolt belay.  5.7, 40m, 17 bolts.Pitch #5: Move 15m to the left into the cleft of rock and scramble up a few final moves to a two-bolt belay. 3rd class, 10m, 2 bolts.Follow cairns up the final slabs to the east and into the easy descent gully behind The Cleft.
