Clip bolts until you reach the giant overhanging roof crack, then it's trad to the top. Enjoy!P1 (5.8, 20m):  Start in a hand sized pocket and climb your way up through very interesting and fun, featured rock. Rock quality on this pitch is a bit variable and some crumbly sections remain, however the moves and bolts are solid. Belay from a very comfortable big ledge. 8 bolts.P2 (5.10c, 20m): Start out face climbing and then move to use features in the crack. After clipping the 4th and final bolt, move up and start plugging gear in the crack. Traverse your way rightwards and up through a series of thuggy roofs. Semi-hanging belay with an extra bolt on the right for the belayer. The crack is fairly irregular so offset nuts and other passive gear is recommended. 4 bolts and then pro from 0.75-3, doubles of 1 and 2.P3 (5.9+, 25m): Climb the center and left crack system, plugging gear up the middle. Shimmy yourself way up into the top of the roof/alcove, plug a nice #2 in the roof crack and move out to some blind moves to pull the roof. Then easier climbing up to the 2nd roof, which can be overcome by a blind reach around to the left. Belay from a comfortable ledge above the crack. Pro from 0.75-3, doubles of 1 (I also placed a 0.2 and a #5).P4 (5.6, 29m):  Easier and less exciting climbing up a crack system to a giant belay ledge with anchors on a north facing wall. Pro from 0.3-2.","protection":"Hardware: 6\" stainless steel Bolt Products Twisted Leg glue-in bolts. Anchors are 2 or 3 bolt anchors with rap rings.Pro: 0.3-3 B.D. cams, doubles of 1 & 2 (I also placed a 0.2 & #5 cam on pitch 3). Offset nuts & other passive gear are great.*As with all climbing in the Hinkey area, helmets are highly recommended.","location":"Follow driving, parking, & hiking directions to get to Cumulonimbus wall. Ridin' Out the Storm starts below the giant overhanging bulge. Scurry up the small hill on the left side of the wall and belay next to a small shallow cave. 1st bolt is about 10' up. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a31fb323-0db7-5e02-b522-f21d3b49b531,9445f336-4fc5-5f06-b386-9dcec24fd7a1,1da58441-6bc4-5f67-b611-5f5c2cc86d89,83bcd52d-f0d5-5b07-9dd2-997a1c1b9a68","pathTokens":["USA","Nevada","Western Nevada","Paradise Valley","Cumulonimbus Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.5431,41.65515]},"bbox":[-117.54370182688406,41.65470033981814,-117.54249817311597,41.65559966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121574465","area_id":"g7zVLfDVWwed0pl6HBuaaA=="},"content":{"description":"Cumulonimbus Wall is essentially the next formation south of The Cleft and is easily spotted from the road and the parking area.
