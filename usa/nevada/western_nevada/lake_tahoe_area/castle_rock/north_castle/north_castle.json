This route predates the 2015 development project but the hardware is modern. It's originally rated at 5.7, and although the start feels quite moderate, a transition from juggier holds to a bumpy but polished face climb crux could feel like a 5.9. Still moderate, but heady for a \"5.7\" lead compared to other 5.7 routes in this area. Good holds, fun moves, variety in the terrain. Lower off.","protection":"6 draws.
