Because the route wanders and traverses, keep in mind that a lead fall could mean a swing and some bruises; wear a helmet.\n\n NotesÂ for TR Although it's only 6 bolts long, this route takes you through some fun variety. However, it can be an awkward toprope with risk of swinging and crashing into the wonderful features on the rock face here if you don't set up directionals. After leading, consider leaving draws up as directionals and have the second climber top rope from the other end of the rope, cleaning as they go. Or, just pull the rope through and lead it again.

Nothing! The route setter and affiliates for this fun lead weren't too concerned with staying on theme. \"Space Pants\" have been a big deal lately and are coming back on the scene.

Generously bolted nonetheless. After possibly the most difficult move of this pitch (5.7 or 5.8), the bolt line finishes at a ledge and a big dihedral with mussy hooks on the Left wall and a rad vertical crux on the Right wall. \n\n  The belay platform isn't perfectly flat but the rope can easily rest on the ground if positioned with enough care. From here you can hear call signals from the top anchors unless it's quite windy; make a signal plan. Also the routes here are quite condensed, so consider using names before call signals to avoid confusion from other climbers calling on the West end of Armory Wall. \n\n  2nd pitch begins with the 5.9 crux wall. Well protected, dead vertical with a few pockets and cracks to work with up to an exit Right of a small roof. Pretty fun! After the crux continue out of the belayer's view at a low angle with a juggy arete Left of the bolt line and various crimps to the Right. \n\n  There's about a 10' juggy low angle run out from the last bolt of the 2nd pitch to mussy hooks at the anchor. You can carefully top out here for mind-blowing panoramic view looking into the Carson Valley on one end, just shy of North Lake on the other, and eeeeverything in between. \n\n  Rappel down. Coil each end of the rope to throw it down the low angle sections of each pitch for a cleaner rappel. Find the least featured, most straightforward and vertical way down the 1st pitch to avoid snagging the rope when you pull it. \n\nChoose your own adventure:\n\n  -Going up   If you want to skip the 1st pitch on the way up and you're a confident 5.8 leader you could consider backpacking the rope to the start of the 2nd pitch by soloing from War Hammer's start through a juggy low angle route toward the vertical bolted crux wall of The Pike. There's one 5.8ish move right below the crux wall before you reach the anchor. \n\n  Theoretically, it's possible to start climbing at the start of War Hammer all the way to the anchor of The Pike's 2nd pitch with a 60 meter rope, using your choice of bolts for protection along the way but the trade off would be increased rope drag and less effective communication from top anchors to belay.\n\n  -Going down   You can bypass the rappel down the 1st pitch by rappelling from the top anchors to the Amory Wall's \"platform.\" Rappelling from the midpoint of a 60 meter rope you can lower to just 5 feet above the start of War Hammer and finish on a short downclimb on great jugs.
