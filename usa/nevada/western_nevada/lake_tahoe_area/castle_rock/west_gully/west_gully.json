A bit pumpy with exciting sections, great rests, and jugs hidden throughout. There maaaay even be a knee bar (or two) in there somewhere! You can pick out this route from the other two at Torture Chamber just from its cool deep juggy structures, worn out of the rock from erosion. That said, a fall here could easily cost you an injury with all sorts of great spots to sprang an ankle. However, the stances are great once you push through a set of moves and the protection is very well placed.  \n\n  Go right after the 4th bolt; The 5th bolt is shared with the middle route (Boiled in Oil 5.11b).

The first bolt is high enough that an injury is very likely if you fall before clipping. So, don't fall. If youre leading 11b you shouldn't have a problem with the first clip, but just do everyone a favor and stick-clip or take a good look at the moves before you start.  \n\n  The crux can be identified from the ground, just after the 2nd bolt.

The routes here were set in the early 90s and are sportier than the moderate stuff at the base of Castle.

Shade alternates from one wall to the other depending on time of day. \n\n  Facing down the gully, the Left side has one route called 5.9 Wall which is... well, a 5.9. A good warm up on colorful featured rock. It is topropable if you go between some trees and scramble up the buttress although the anchors may be a bit difficult to find from the top and/or uncomfortable to reach. \n\n  On the right side of the gully next to a tree is the Torture Chamber, with a 5.10b and two 11s sharing a pair of open cold shuts.
