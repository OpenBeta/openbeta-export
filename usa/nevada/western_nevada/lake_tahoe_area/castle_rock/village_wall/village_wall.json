Good idea to establish name use when calling \"take\" if you have neighboring climbers here to avoid confusion and possibly a fall.\n\n It's convenient for the next leader to start at the Left side of the first anchor. Follow bolts up low angle and somewhat dirty second pitch (5.5) to mussy hooks for anchors.\n\n The rock above the second set of anchors is loose and a hazard to climb as holds can break and rock fall can injure or kill people below.\n\n Rappel down. Going up is the easy part. Coil and throw rope out to avoid snags on the low angle second pitch.\n\nCAUTION: Be picky about finding the midpoint of the rope and TIE STOPPER KNOTS to rappel, the second pitch is almost exactly long enough to rappel down a 60 meter rope.\n\n Find the least featured, most straightforward and vertical way to rappel down the first pitch (about 10 feet Right of the start) to avoid snagging the rope when you pull it.","protection":"9 bolts on each pitch.
