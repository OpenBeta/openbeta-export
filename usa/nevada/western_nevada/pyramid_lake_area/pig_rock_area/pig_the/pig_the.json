There are probably at least 5 distinct variations you could climb off of this anchor. We did 4. They are all fairly similar grade. Felt like 5.7 slab climbing for the most part, with a move or two that might be approaching 5.8.\n\n There's a few cool pockets and some decent little ledges. Some of the rock isn't very sturdy, i wouldn't want to lead it, but fine for messing around on top rope.\n\n There is an old bolt line for a sport route a bit to the right where all the bolts have been chopped. Not sure what the history is out here, but it is probably long and varied.","protection":"2 bolt anchor. no chains or rap rings","location":"We used the directions from MP and got out here fairly easily and drove all the way to the bottom of the rock.
