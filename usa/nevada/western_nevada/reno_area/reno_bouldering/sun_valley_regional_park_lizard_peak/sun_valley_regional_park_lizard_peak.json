Most are too small or jumbled to warrant much attention, but one cluster (conveniently right next to the main parking) has a couple of decent problems. These, combined with a round on the pitch-n-putt, can make for a very pleasant winter afternoon.Separately, there is quite a bit of broken glass and trash scattered around the boulders: it would be cool if climbers cleaned it up a bit each time they went. Barring this and the graffitied rock, the ambience is almost pleasant.
