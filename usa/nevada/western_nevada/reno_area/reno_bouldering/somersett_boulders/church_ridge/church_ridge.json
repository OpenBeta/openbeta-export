The back cluster is where you'll find the Twin Cracks and some other unlisted stuff. There's cool exploring to be had and the rock is of very high quality; some of the best in fact of the entire sommerset zone.  Expect bullet tan granite with few feet to be had... \n\n  There is an acquaduct you must cross to access this area from the church, if its running there is a way around about a quarter mile to the west; or you can come in from the other side but its a good half hr walk. \n\n  Be cautious of Snakes and hostile locals.  we've gotten some grief over the years from old schoolers who used to go up here before Sommerset, or the Church, ever existed.  But this is public land, and they cannot kick you off. But either way... be discreet, and leave no trace.  As long as you're respectful, its all good.  Same goes for parking at the Church, we've never had a problem so lets keep it that way.
