It's quality varies from bad to terrible, but amongst the sand and choss there are several very cool problems. \n\n  While we don't advise anyone to try and top out on this structure, there's a couple great problems that move upward over the most secure edges and a wicked traverse across the very steep underbelly. \n\n  The stone is soft and it breaks, think desert sandstone only worse.  But if you tread lightly, you will find some great moves across this face that will improve both your strength and technique. \n\n  In the greater Northwest region of the Washoe Valley there are indeed a few clusters of boulders here and there that are worth exploring."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:19.832Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:43.808Z"}
