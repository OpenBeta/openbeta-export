The cliff band also has a rocky beach across from it.  The rocky beach often has people hanging out at it. \n\n  This area could definitely use the climbing community stopping in every once in a while, it could use a good cleanup, that is for sure. \n\n  Also, if you are going to jump off the Farad Bridge know that it is private property and they don't like people doing it.  I've seen a sheriff stop by telling people he would write tickets for jumping.  Just be smart about it.  As far as I know the cliffs themselves are public lands."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:20.371Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:44.345Z"}
