The area is basically a southeast facing hillside with several dozen large granite blocs, size ranges from steep low balls to proud 30 foot walls. There are some towering lines out here, and the rock is Tahoe-style, speckled granite. The FA potential is almost untapped.The boulder field is located above the town of Verdi on the Cali/Nev border. If you're driving towards Reno on 80, as you come out of the canyon look up and to the northwest, you can see the light colored blocs on the far hillside.You can get to the boulders directly from Verdi but it involves a long uphill hike that crosses private property. To avoid trespassing, see below for an alternate route. The alternate route does not cross private property and involves a longer drive but a much easier hike, although a high-clearance, 4WD or AWD vehicle is recommended."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:19.227Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:43.016Z"}
