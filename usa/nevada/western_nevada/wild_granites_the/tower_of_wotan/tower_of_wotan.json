Exit the chimney left into crux big reaches between good holds. Enjoy the hand crack as it diagonals right, then goes straight up through a roof. Where the crack takes a 90-degree right turn, step left to the bolted face. One bolt takes you to a bolted anchor. 5.11a P3) Start right off the belay, following the bolt line with a couple early cruxes. After bolt 3, the climbing eases a bit and the climb is more spaced.

It is probably the easiest way to that summit. P1) From the bottom of the large chimney, climb blocky terrain to reach the first large ledge. Carefully pull down on the Wheat-Thin-like flake system on the face above. Traverse right around the corner and belay on a sloping ledge. 5.10c PG13 P2) Downclimb around left past a tree and up a left-facing corner, then cut hard back right past the “falcon cave”. Traverse around 50 feet in total and end up under a flaring thin hands crack. 5.9 P3) Follow the crack into a left-facing corner where the crack flares and seams out. At the top, traverse right through the notch and climb unprotected 5.4 face to the tower’s summit.
