The larger chubby-looking tower to the south is Grandstaff Tower. The base is soft sandstone and the top is crumbling conglomerate. The conglomerate is a mixed bag of good rock and choss, cracks will take and hold good gear while cobbles fall off in your hand next to it. The sand stone is basically shit for anything other than moving over it lightly. I had heard that Randy Grandstaff had climbed this years ago. If so, any evidence from his passage is long since gone but I’ve no doubt that folk have been climbing this feature for generations."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:27.635Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:22.991Z"}
