Most people never make it past the sport routes on the Cannibal Crag. The route consits of a right curving crack the follows the hillside up. The first crux comes about 15' up and involves a long reach to a nice finger lock. The second crux is a bit higher and consists of a flared fingerlock to a good hand jam. Make sure to place a piece in the alcove to protect your follower on the crux moves. Coming out of the alcove and traversing the crack to the finish is still a bit tricky.","protection":"One .75 camalot and doubles of .50 camalots and smaller should get you up.
