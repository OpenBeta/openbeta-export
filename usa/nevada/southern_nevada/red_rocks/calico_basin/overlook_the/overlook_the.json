It tops out onto the huge, vertical buttress that bounds the right side of the low angle slab of the Overlook. As a new route it's still cleaning up and might be a little crispy especially through the varnish on the second pitch.Pitch 1, 5.11a: Climb the obvious right facing flake feature out of the approach wash pulling through the steepness onto the slab above. This is the crux of the route involving some liebacking and crimping with small feet. Follow the low-angle crack/seam above (5.8) to the anchors on a small but comfortable ledge. 11 bolts, 90ft.Pitch 2, 5.10a: Climb up the easy slab following the bolts through the scoop to a crux mantle out of the scoop. Follow the low angle ledge to where the bolts continue up the vertical face through the varnish. The anchors are on the left side of the cap of rock that forms the top of the buttress. Most of the climbing on this pitch is in the 8 or 9 range except the well protected crux, 13 bolts 110ft.Descent: There are three descent options: 1) Walk off the back side of the buttress down an easy ramp and scramble down the wash back to the base. 2) Rappel the route. 3) There is a rappel line off the other side of the buttress that involves a free hanging rappel into the gulley (anchors on very top of buttress).","protection":"Bolts all the way. Bolted anchors.","location":"As you near the Overlook when the approach drainage/wash becomes its narrowest with vertical cliffs squeezing in on either side, you will scramble under a tree and over a couple body-sized boulders. Once through this you'll be in the wash proper and on relatively flat ground. YKY is on the left side, or West side, across the wash in front of you. It starts right where you would scramble back out of the wash to the Overlook base ledge."},"__v":0},{"_id":"q/aGf+thXO+2pb7M2kQO5g==","name":"Qukenator","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Thao Vo, Kevin Clark, Joshua Gale 05/10/2018","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.43522,36.16059]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"116744675","mp_crag_id":"116744282","climb_id":"q/aGf+thXO+2pb7M2kQO5g==","areaRef":"fZnKdtkCXVKpgxqil7myog=="},"content":{"description":"Overcome the challenging start and enjoy easier climbing for the remainder of the route.
