It is a vertical, varnished face identified by a large cutout of rock on its lower left side which forms a left-facing corner and a roof. The right side of the wall forms a left-facing corner with a lower angle ramp and overhanging bulge. It's located above and climber’s left of the Fringe. It's also across the wash from the Overlook. The wall is SE facing and visible from the Kraft parking lot. It gets lots of morning sun, and goes into the shade after noon in the winter, and after 2pm in the summer. All routes are bolt protected sport climbs. The approach is kinda long for a Red Rock sport climbing wall, but you won't deal with crowds at all, and there are other walls in the area to round out a full day."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:22.711Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:06.164Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"6594e3e2f8258fb5bda02422","prevHistoryId":"6594c98bf8258fb5bd9f0c73","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
