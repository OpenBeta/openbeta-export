Just left of Thing 1 the chimney that tapers down into a #4 wide crack looks intimidating, but the jugs all around make it an easy exit. Watch out for that squeeze chimney at the end though, it won't be fun and downright improbable if you've got a backpack on. WARNING as with Thing 1 this route is still developing and shit falls off a lot! (Please wear your helmets and step lightly) Once this thing is cleaned up though it'll be a great 4 star route for new trad climbers who want some chimney action! There are no rings to rap the 1st pitch, but you can hike up the descent and build anchors to rap down to P1 bolted anchors and set up a TR. Oh, as seen in the photo the descent is a walk off, climber's right :)","protection":"Doubles up to BD #4, but once you get it dialed in a single rack to BD #4 should suffice. 3 bolts with homemade hangers for P1 anchors (can be easily backed up with a few pieces) and build your own anchor at the top.","location":"Approach as for The Fringe, but head up and right instead of up and left :)"},"__v":0},{"_id":"pyiG8LIaWGqfbqELqmykwg==","name":"Thing 1","yds":"5.10a/b","grades":{"yds":"5.10a/b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Not sure","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.43305,36.16138]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"121925261","mp_crag_id":"121925233","climb_id":"pyiG8LIaWGqfbqELqmykwg==","areaRef":"Yhxn7KMeUAyG18UQiD9ThA=="},"content":{"description":"Take the crack on the right and go straight up! Face on the left can bail you out if your crack climbing skills are still developing, but staying in the crack will require a couple arm bars, hand stacks and maybe even a knee bar :) Then you get to some pretty hollow flakes that you really better not use as underclings otherwise they're really very likely to pop right off (please don't place pro in there, use the thin crack).
