In the past year or so, bolted belays were added which changed the character of the route a bit. Now it is possible to do the best pitches and rap off. Personally I think the addition of bolted belays is a good thing, otherwise some of the belay locations would be awkward. The crux pitch now has an extra bolt (see description). I do not know the origin of these new bolts.\n\n The start of the route may be identified by a 6-12\" crack that goes up to a scrubby tree. This crack is clean but the start looks like a grunt, so we climbed a thin crack to the left and stepped right, which seemed harder than the 5.7 rating of this pitch. Continue up past the tree, and climb double cracks (see Swain's topo) up a slot to a bolted belay at the top of a flake/pedestal (5.7, 130').\n\n P2: Move down and step right, then head straight up cracks, through a short chimney, and follow more cracks to another bolted belay (5.8, 150'). I thought this was the best pitch on the route.\n\n P3: Head up to a right facing corner and crank past a small overhang. Crank over and then follow a wide crack and less than stellar rock to the next belay (no offwidthing necessary) (5.8, [90' according to comment below]).\n\n P4: The crux pitch. Move up and then right to a new bolt. Continue up to an ancient 1/4\" bolt. There is a new bolt maybe 3' higher than the rusty bolt. I don't know why they didn't just replace the 1/4\" bolt. The rock on this pitch is a little suspect, but the crux section is not too long and is now quite well protected. Continue on up to another bolted belay. This is the last bolted belay on the route, so if you want to go down, do so now. (5.9, 140').\n\n P5: This pitch has a reputation for bad rock, and indeed be extra careful as a hold could easily snap off. However bad rock in Red Rocks is still pretty good. Follow a steep crack through nice (too nice) horizontal dikes to a huge ledge. Throw in protection often in case a hold snaps off, this pitch has recorded some spectacular falls, but it is really not that bad, just be careful (5.8, 150').\n\n P6: Scramble easily past bushes to a large chimney, climb the corner to the left and belay on a large ledge at the base of a left facing corner (5.2, 160').\n\n P7: Climb the left facing corner, then move right to a weird dihedral above a bottomless chimney. This next section is hard to protect due to the zig-zag nature of the pitch. Stem up and finish the pitch at a notch (5.7, 160'). Alternatively, follow bolts directly above the belay (this is the final pitch of Unimpeachable Groping). From there either rap Unimpeachable, or rap into the notch from a single bolt, and continue as below.","protection":"Standard rack to #3 Camalot, maybe some additional small cams.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"t2HtFwFWWhKBWKXXhIHvOA==","name":"Ginger Crack Variation Finish (Der Guberbaum)","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.48829,36.11213]},"left_right_index":11,"mp_id":"113781810","mp_crag_id":"105732018","climb_id":"t2HtFwFWWhKBWKXXhIHvOA==","areaRef":"b2jVIFy3WLqR5vjwVW7XOA=="},"content":{"description":"This is a new-to-me finish that is more in line, literally and figuratively, with the rest of the climbing on Ginger Cracks.

Blade Runner - AKA The Ginger Arête - climbs this feature in three wild pitches. The line, which is easily visible from the highway (and unmistakable when illuminated by the morning sun), is both really fun climbing and, for those capable of climbing the grade, destined to become the natural finish to Ginger Cracks. Keep in mind, however, that this route is demanding: Though the hard moves are all well-protected, you don't get pro every body length. Also, as is the case with many routes in Red Rocks that haven't received much traffic, Blade Runner has quite a few fragile holds and thin, hollow flakes. The route will undoubtedly clean up with time, but the climbing will \"feel\" harder because the rock demands a light touch.\n\n Approach: Climb Ginger Cracks through pitch 5 to the beginning of the 4th class 6th pitch. Rather than scramble up to the start of the final corner, look right: Careful study of the arête will reveal a lone bolt about 25' up. Begin here.\n\n P1 (110', 5.8): Climb up incut but fragile holds on the face just left of the arête passing a few optional gear placements en-route to the first bolt. Avoid a huge, overhanging block directly on the arête by moving back left to gain a short hand crack splitting a large patch of black varnish. Continue briefly up this before returning again to the arête and a second bolt. Four more bolts lead directly up the exposed edge to an awesome belay platform. A total of 6 bolts and some hand-sized cams protect.\n\n P2 (130', 5.10b): Climb directly up the arête passing 9 bolts for protection. Belay on a great ledge formed by an oven-sized block (careful). This pitch is amazing.\n\n P3 (110', 5.9): Continue up the arête, climbing on both sides, passing 5 bolts before gaining a low angle hand crack. Follow this to a sixth bolt and a final traverse left on an obvious ledge to a bolted anchor. Again, 6 bolts and some hand-sized cams protect.\n\n To descend, rappel straight down from the anchor with one 60m rope to a dedicated rappel anchor (do not skip this anchor on rappel or your rope will get stuck). A second single-rope rap leads to the notch between the main wall and the standard top out of Ginger Cracks. From here a third single-rope rap off a slung chockstone leads down into the bowl above Power Failure.","protection":"9x draws, some hand-sized cams, and at least a 60m rope.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"vdJH9pfEWG264c2tF75EsA==","name":"All You Can Eat","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Kal Conley, Geoff Conley, Anthony Anagnostou","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.48829,36.11213]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"107594992","mp_crag_id":"105732018","climb_id":"vdJH9pfEWG264c2tF75EsA==","areaRef":"b2jVIFy3WLqR5vjwVW7XOA=="},"content":{"description":"All You Can Eat is a fine rock climb that appeases all the types of climbers out there. The smooth corners that make up the first two pitches are a rarity in Red Rock and satisfy those looking to climb some good, splitter crack. It shares the same first half of Power Failure's first pitch. Look for the bolt.  \n\n  Approach Pitch: This can easily be soloed or rope up if you want. Start at the 1st pitch of Power Failure up to the first bolt. Pull onto the ledge and walk climber's right to a obtuse corner crack system.  \n\n  There are two options for the first pitch. Both are high quality and engaging.  \n\n  Pitch 1.a: Start out in the adjacent crack to the left of the obtuse right facing crack and traverse back into the crack above the 2nd bolt. The Direct goes straight up through both bolts and goes at 5.11d. The 11d is comprised of holds facing \"the wrong way\" and some longer reaches to better holds. The crux is low on the left crack. Strenuous liebacking and a thrilling step across move leads back into the main crack. Once above the 2nd bolt climb easier rock to a nice belay ledge. Two bolt anchor. 90' 5.10c/d, height dependent.  \n\n  Pitch 1.b: About 25' to the right of the regular start is an offwidth corner/left facing crack. Climb the offwidth to a hand crack. From here the crack constricts and is tips liebacking. Lieback up under the block and surmount the block. Traverse left on a left slanting finger crack and up onto the pillar. 100' 5.11b \n\n  Pitch 2: Climb up the left facing corner/crack system past two bolts. The bolts are not necessary if you have small cams and stoppers. The crack goes from tips, to hands to a wide flare past a set of anchors. Skip these and go up to the next set of anchors. There is some loose rock in this section but good cam placements can be found on solid varnish. 100' 5.10a \n\n  From here we rapped with a single rope but the route continues up for three more pitches.
