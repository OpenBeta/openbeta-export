I, Andrew La Combe got the 2nd. Both of us put time into working the problem with sand and rock crumbling, now its a solid line for anyone who want a cave problem with low fall.  ","protection":"Two to three pads need with a spot.","location":"Enter Red Springs Picnic Area, head toward moderate mecca, cave problem is just below it about 30ft down. Easy way is to hike down to the bottom, follow trail until you are just below moderate and hike up to a big boulder leaning on another one. About 30ft up the hill, approach time about 15mins. Once there enter the little opening,you see a jug start on the inside right. Walk down to your right as well."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a31fb323-0db7-5e02-b522-f21d3b49b531,eeabff85-bcb1-5aac-a784-2f3003d01d09,bea6bf11-de53-5046-a5b4-b89217b7e9bc,37ff48e8-ef70-5be1-b9a3-8a7f154d75d5,834fd560-1bf7-5925-8216-7da83d65e2ef,ccf621db-0b8a-5c69-a534-d4844eb20b46","pathTokens":["USA","Nevada","Southern Nevada","Red Rocks","* Red Rock Bouldering","Red Spring Boulders","Finish Line Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4-5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.42125,36.14187]},"bbox":[-115.42180681396071,36.14142033981813,-115.42069318603929,36.14231966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107683122","area_id":"zPYh2wuKXGmlNNSETrILRg=="},"content":{"description":"Cave problem, all overhang and good quality rock once passed the jugs.
