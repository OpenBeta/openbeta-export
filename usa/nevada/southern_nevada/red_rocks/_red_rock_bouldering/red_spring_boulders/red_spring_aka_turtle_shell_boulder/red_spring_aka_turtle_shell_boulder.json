The stand start is noted as V6 in the guidebook (Monkey Wrench Left). Sit Start should add about 1 or may be 2 v grades. However I'm not certain of the grade due to my lack of experience.I do not claim FA as I'm sure this has been done, but I have not seen this variation done anywhere on the internet nor in the guidebook. When I saw this in the guidebook and tried it, there was no chalk on the top half of the boulder. Although the sit start takes away some stars from this climb, it does add endurance component to the climb and makes the finish of the stand interesting. If you are there and did everything else (Monkey Trench, Spring Loaded, etc.), this is worth checking out.Video: https://youtu.be/11UJ_hEfTBU","protection":"","location":"Start as Monkey Trench and link into Monkey Wrench Left to work up the seam and top out straight up. "},"__v":0},{"_id":"k2Oy7XuMWmi3vuzLe+UT0A==","name":"Monkey Trench","yds":"V9-","grades":{"yds":"V9-","font":"7C","vscale":"V9-"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.42008,36.1434]},"left_right_index":10,"mp_id":"113749650","mp_crag_id":"107158774","climb_id":"k2Oy7XuMWmi3vuzLe+UT0A==","areaRef":"rCh4VIfoWPWP3vjKCb9F9Q=="},"content":{"description":"The low low for monkey wrench, starting on the undercling as for high road, but head the OTHER WAY and finish monkey wrench.
