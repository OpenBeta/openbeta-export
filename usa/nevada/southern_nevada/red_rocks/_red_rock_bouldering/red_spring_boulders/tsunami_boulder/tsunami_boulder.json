Move up and make some pretty good moves using sidepulls and crimps. The crimps at the top are great and the mantle to finish is exciting- especially with a ankle breaker boulder below you should you blow it.","protection":"A spotter and a pad is pretty nice.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"OqzOmwozUrmYsQg206LgrQ==","name":"Amazing Grace","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"Donny Hardin, early 1990s","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.42232,36.14693]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"114381509","mp_crag_id":"107453243","climb_id":"OqzOmwozUrmYsQg206LgrQ==","areaRef":"3q0XlNrNVuCnDCHZdz34+w=="},"content":{"description":"Amazing Grace is a great line found on the Southern Face of the Tsunami Boulder.
