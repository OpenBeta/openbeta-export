Aesthetic moves out the edge of a large roof lead to a deadpoint to a jug, and an easy topout follows.  Start on a sloping undercling under the roof and a good disk on the arete. \n\n  While the Southern Nevada Bouldering book gives this problem a V9, I don't think it is even an 8; it is probably a bit easier than Bubble Butt in the Krafts.","protection":"Perfect flat & sandy landing.  One pad is helpful.","location":"From the Bloodline boulder walk up and across the hillside along a faint trail in a northerly direction for 300-400 meters.
