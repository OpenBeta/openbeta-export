When you are nearing the start of the short, red cliff band on your right, you should see a large boulder directly right of the trail (see pic). On the opposite side of the trail (left), the top of the Get Moist is visible through the trees. It is also possible to hike up the wash until you the boulder comes up on your right, but you can't see the problem from the wash.
