Crux is the opening moves. Sit start on two rounded crimps, moving up and right to better holds. At one point you get a sweet two finger lock to bump your other hand up to the lip. A V9 variation of Wet Dream Right can be done stand start on the jug. Bring plenty of pads for this one.","protection":"NA","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"mKymTgbQWU2x5cpl2Oommw==","name":"Wet Dream","yds":"V12","grades":{"yds":"V12","font":"8A+","vscale":"V12"},"fa":"Ethan Pringle","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.46282,36.03603]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"120262343","mp_crag_id":"111950653","climb_id":"mKymTgbQWU2x5cpl2Oommw==","areaRef":"64dqPm7wXk2UM+1f0aqpUQ=="},"content":{"description":"A case could be made for the most classic problem of the grade in the country. Shares a start with an easier version to the right where they both meet back up with each other at the horizontal crack for the daunting fingerlock move. A quintessential power endurance climb with multiple v8/9 moves and a heartbreaking finish as you throw for a blocky pinch off of two slopers about ten feet off the deck.
