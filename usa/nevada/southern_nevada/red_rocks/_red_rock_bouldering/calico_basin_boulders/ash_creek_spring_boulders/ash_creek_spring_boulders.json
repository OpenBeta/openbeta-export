Start at the very back of the crack, and bury your feet up high.  Do a sit up and shuffle out the roof.  Pull the lip with a fun pivot and the help from a few edges.  Although not technically all that difficult, it is quite an enjoyable climb.  Additionally, there are probably numerous ways to climb this.  \n\n  This reminds me of a similar (but easier) sandstone version of Vedauwoo's Desiderata V5.
