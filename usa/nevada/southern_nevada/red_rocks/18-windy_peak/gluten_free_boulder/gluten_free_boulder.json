Stemming and creative use of face holds move you into the crack with solid jams in the corner to get over the small roof to a comfortable stance. Small gear protects a couple thin finger jams as you move up through the short chimney. Continue following the crack as it curves overhead and to the right under a roof on medium sized gear and jams. Scramble to the top of the formation and walk off to climbers left.\n\n We built an anchor in the final 1-3\" crack and lowered from there in order to clean the gear, then we scrambled up the backside to clean the anchor and walked off.","protection":"Standard rack to 3\".
