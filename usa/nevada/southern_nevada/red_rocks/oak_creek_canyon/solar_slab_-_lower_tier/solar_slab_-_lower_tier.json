One long 65 meter pitch places you above the bolted arete at a two bolt belay station. Pitch 2: Continue up on the face past intermittent cracks and a sea of small jugs. This second pitch, finishes as a full 70 meter line that ends with establishing an anchor system on a few angling cracks.

Obviously, a complete ascent to the very top would require linking a lower and upper route, or following one of the full-length routes described in the Upper Tier section.  Most of routes in this section go from the ground to Terrace, a giant, multi-acre ledge about 500 feet up.  There are two main ways to descend from the Terrace.  Most common is to rappel the Solar Slab Gully.  This can be done with a single rope.  Alternatively, there are bolted rap anchors on Johnny Vegas; this route requires two ropes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":15,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:18.787Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:00.397Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"6594e713f8258fb5bda08b33","prevHistoryId":"6594c98bf8258fb5bd9f0c73","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
