This first pitch turned out to be the crux of the route at 5.9 but thereâ€™re many ways to reach this ramp and the rest of the climb was 5.8 or less. Boulder, scramble, and short rope to the toe of the left pillar. Climb easy face and cracks up and left to the bottom of a long, shallow, right-facing dihedral. This dihedral is the right side of a rib of rock that forms a shallow arch. Step left and climb thin cracks up the center of the arch. When this feature merges back into the wall, go up and slightly right through a runout section of easy friction. Aim for a thin crack that ends a few feet above the friction slab, make a couple of committing moves on steep rock to reach the crack (and pro!) and belay above the short headwall. Follow cracks up the middle of the pillar to the top.","protection":"Double rack of cams up to #3, 1 #4, set of stoppers.","location":"On the east side of north Sandstone Mt, just south of the mouth of Sandstone Canyon."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a31fb323-0db7-5e02-b522-f21d3b49b531,eeabff85-bcb1-5aac-a784-2f3003d01d09,bea6bf11-de53-5046-a5b4-b89217b7e9bc,b4fd6367-c5cb-55ff-8339-54def207b2a9,edf9f2c8-ea41-5217-a03c-2a2f8ccbf850","pathTokens":["USA","Nevada","Southern Nevada","Red Rocks","15-Sandstone Canyon","Bonnie's Pillar"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.46974,36.05822]},"bbox":[-115.4702962214759,36.05777033981813,-115.46918377852411,36.058669660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113403820","area_id":"7fnyyOpBUhegPCovjMv4UA=="},"content":{"description":"On the north summit of Sandstone Mt, on the east flank, is a tall, narrow wall, split by a huge chimney, that sits between two distinct gullies.
