The wall is made up of a large, left-facing corner with an off-width crack. On the right is a cupcake shaped face with a white patch of rock next to a flake (featured on Metalbeard). There are climbs to the left and right of this corner. Around the corner to the right is the large box chimney (Double Decker Couch). 10 feet right is the steep crack (Everything is Awesome). These two are trad climbs with anchors. Everything else is bolted sport. Please note the routes are relatively new as of May 2019 and still cleaning up so expect some loose rock and the occasional breakable hold here and there."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:23.261Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:44.866Z"}
