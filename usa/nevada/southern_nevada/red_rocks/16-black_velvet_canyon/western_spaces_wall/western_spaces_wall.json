Western Spaces is one of the shortest routes on the wall and set up for rapping although you could top out after another pitch or so and do the walk off. Like some of the other routes on this wall, the rock quality varies and the climbing always keeps you engaged. \n\n  Pitch 1. 10- (120') From the left end of the ledge, climb up a right facing corner, escaping the corner to the left before the corner turns right. Climb upwards and slightly left to an obvious bolted anchor. One old, but fairly good looking bolt, protects some fun climbing on brittle flakes on this pitch. \n\n  Pitch 2. 10 (130') Diagonal right across the face passing a bolt to reach a shallow corner crack. Fun climbing up this for 20 or so feet then leads to more diagonal climbing (left this time) to the visible anchors. This pitch wanders a bit. \n\n  Pitch 3. 9 (120') Climb straight up the face and cracks angling right some. You have options on how you reach the next anchor, which is to the right and at a shallow left facing corner. The anchor is made up of four nuts. \n\n  Pitch 4. 11- (120') Climb the obvious crack passing a bolt and gingerly pulling the sporty crux on less than confidence inspiring flakes. Eventually you reach the last bolted belay and rappel anchor. \n\n  Rappel the route with two 60 meter ropes. Pitch length were estimates and I don't think a 70 would get you all the way down. \n\n  The Brock and Swain guides have a decent topo for this route.","protection":"We took a good selection of gear including nuts, small cams, BD cams up to a #3, and doubles of .6\" to 1.25\" as Handren's guide suggested. That seemed to work fine and gear was mostly adequate. First, second, and fourth anchors are bolted and the third is made up of four equalized nuts. All stations were set up for rappel. The webbing is weathered.","location":"On the right side of the Western Spaces Wall and on the far left side of a thin ledge that comes in from the right underneath Black Sun and Mr. Natural of the Desert, there is a shallow right facing corner (Start)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"MljlOg4YUS6RBgrlH7IpLg==","name":"Tranquility Base","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Dave Wonderly, Warren Egbert 1989","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.47075,36.03712]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"110990116","mp_crag_id":"105732195","climb_id":"MljlOg4YUS6RBgrlH7IpLg==","areaRef":"Al/cP8GPVLOkUQLGdS2NlA=="},"content":{"description":"Caveat: This is not an accurate description of the first ascent route. We (I) led us off route on the third pitch, and we had to add a traversing pitch in order to get back on route. If anyone makes the same mistake, this is an appropriate correction. If anyone climbs the route proper, feel free to augment our information. \n\n  Also, the Handren description is very inaccurate. Grades seem to be correct, but pitch lengths are way off. \n\n  This rock on this route prevents me giving more stars. You should only climb this route of you are comfortable at the grade, and are familiar with the more friable sandstone found in Red Rock. \n\n  Approach as for Western Spaces Wall. This involves climbing up fixed ropes, and quite a bit of chimneying. Arrive at the base of the climb after the last chimney. The first bolt of the first pitch should be apparent ca. 10 ft above. \n\n  Pitch 1, 140' (10cR) Climb past the first bolt, performing a sporty move that leads to a crack that runs up and slightly left. Climb to a second bolt, and up to a left-facing corner. climb the corner or arete a while to a a bolt below a roof. Traverse left, and maneuver above the roof, climbing up and slightly right to a two-bolt anchor. \n\n  Pitch 2, 120' (7+) Climb up and right past lichen-covered rock and gain a crack/corner system that leads slightly right and up. Climb to a fixed gear anchor that includes a couple of nuts and hexes. \n\n  Pitch 3, 140' (10b/cR) Climb up and right past a bolt, and face climb up to a ledge past runout flakes. Climb up to a ledge and clip a bolt up high. Climb past the bolt and follow a crack up and left to a ledge with a large pine tree and a couple of smaller trees. Belay off of the pine. NOTE: This is the pitch that we got off route. The correct belay is where the crack branches, but this was not apparent at the time. The next pitch describes how to get back on route. \n\n  Pitch 4, 120' (8R) Move onto the face of the buttress to the right. Climb up until you can get decent gear, and traverse right at the top of the formation. The rock here is very soft and unconsolidated, so caution must be taken. Belay in a right-facing corner at a small stance.  \n\n  Pitch 5, 160' (10cR) Move up the right-facing corner. Pass 3 bolts and belay in a crack below a roof.  \n\n  Pitch 6, 190' (10aR) Move up and over the left side of the roof, and continue straight past crack and face. Belay on a huge block at the base of a face. \n\n  Pitch 7, 190' (9) Climb up the face a short while until you reach a crack. Follow the crack up and slightly right to a low angle bowl/chimney, and belay at a stance below another obvious low-angle chimney. \n\n  Pitch 8, 100' (6) Climb up the low angle chimney to the top of the formation, crossing over a gap to the right to reach the final ledge.  \n\n  Scramble down and skier's right to a tree with slings. Make 4 double rope raps to the top of the gulley, trending down and skier's right. Traverse right across the south-facing slab and follow a fixed rope path to reach the beginning of the route.

A few probably a really bad idea to fall right now moments in 9-10a territory keep this from being a route I wholeheartedly recommend. You want to be solid at adventure climbing and plan on topping out. Bailing after the first pitch will cost you some gear.  \n\n  Pitch 1, 110' (10c) Climb a right facing corner (the left most) up to where the corner turns to the right. Youll diagonal left across the face and three bolts and gear and finally up to the base of a shallow and thin corner. Bolted anchor. \n\n  Pitch 2, 100' (10) All the guidebooks gave this pitch a 10a. Climb straight up the thin seem (wires) to a really fun finger crack with interesting and memorable climbing. Continue up to a bolt and look up at an impressive slightly overhanging headwall with a couple of thin cracks.

Gear anchor (bigger pieces BD #3/#4).    \n\n  Pitch 3, 100' (9) Up the chimney eventually making a slight jog to the right before continuing up and taking the left of two cracks. Gear anchor. The guidebooks end the pitch here saying that it ends below a roof. We found that not to be the case and there was another pitch before the roof.  \n\n  Pitch 4, 90' (9) Climb straight up a finger crack with plenty of face holds to belay below a roof. Gear anchor. You could combine 3 & 4, I believe. Combined, it would be a long pitch and not 90'.  \n\n  Pitch 5, 180' (10) The rock quality below the roof sucks. The roof spans a horizontal distance of at least 30 and is of good rock. Pick the line of least resistance (or most fun) and go at it keeping in mind that your gear probably sucks. The difficulties subside quickly and you diagonal right to the big corner climbing fun huecos for as long as you can. Gear anchor at the base of a chimney.   \n\n  Pitch 6, 70-80' (6) Up the chimney to an obvious exit and the top.  \n\n  The first two pitches are really fun, good, with memorable movement.
