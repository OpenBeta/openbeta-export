Hike and scramble up First Creek, passing beneath the sprawling Slippery Peak Apron.  Immediately beyond, the canyon branches.  From the fork, the Raven Buttress can be easily seen as the rounded promontory overlooking the left (southern) branch.  Scramble up to a ledge with a few pine trees at the base of the buttress. \n\n  Climb into, and follow, the right-facing corner system for a few pitches to a good ledge at the top of an obvious tower.  The headwall is passed by traversing left to a right-leaning crack system which leads up to the very large Crow's Nest Ledge.  At this point the route becomes less steep, and a few hundred feet of class four climbing lead to the top of the buttress.  Hike left along the contact with the grey limestone until you can climb up to the ridgetop leading east.  Follow this over the summits of Indecision Peak until a third class descent can be made back to the desert.  For a less adventurous descent, you can go right (west) along the Crow's Nest Ledge to regain the approach canyon. \n\n  This route is named in memory of the irreplaceable Lee Stout, who was taken from us way too early.","protection":"Standard rack.

This is the first known route to reach the pointy summit. We found no evidence of previous human presence up there, and there definitely isn't an easy (non-technical) way up. Those interested in repeating this route better come prepared for adventure!\n\nPitch 1 (5.7, 140 feet): Jam the left-facing handcrack. Enjoy it before it degrades into an unstable ramp detached blocks. The route gets its name from the incredible amount of trundling done on this section.\n\nPitch 2 (5.8, 100 feet): Send your strongest leader on this one. Continue up the ramp until it peters out. Head straight up on good crimps into an incipient crack. Follow this upward until it dead-ends at the giant orange ceiling, then make a hanging belay.\n\nPitch 3 (5.10a, 60 feet): Execute an improbable face traverse left with intermittent gear placements. After a good rest stance, commit to a wild crimp traverse which gains a much-deserved belay ledge.\n\nPitch 4 (5.9, 150 feet): Head up the loose left-facing corner to a ledge rest below a steep hands section. Jam your way to easier terrain. Belay in a comfortable alcove behind a hanging tree.\n\nPitch 5 (5.8, 100 feet): Climb the varnished face to the right of the corner. Instead of continuing up and right to the arete, cut left and make a belay at the base of a left-facing corner.\n\nPitch 6 (5.6, 80 feet): Romp up the easy left-facing corner to the summit ridge. Surmount a bulge on the ridge to gain a subsidiary summit.\n\nSummit Scramble: Head due east along the narrowing ridge and drop into the gully at a notch. (Note: If short on time, you can bail here).
