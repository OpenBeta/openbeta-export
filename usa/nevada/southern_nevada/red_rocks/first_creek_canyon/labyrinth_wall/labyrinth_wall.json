You get great views of Wilson, the Strip, and all the First Creek Slabs below. The climbing isn't that bad either but does have a few runout places. Be careful on the 7th pitch. It is easy climbing but pro is sparse. Combining this with any of the lower slab routes would make for a big grade IV day.There are no bolts on this climb but belays are generally good and easy to get. This is probably the easiest way to get up the labyrinth wall. As with any new route however, be aware that all holds may not be bomber. I give the route 3 stars because of its position, length, and a few really neat pitches. That being said, it has some sections of mediocre rock, is runout on some easy terrain, and would be better compared to a Resolution Arete style of climbing.
