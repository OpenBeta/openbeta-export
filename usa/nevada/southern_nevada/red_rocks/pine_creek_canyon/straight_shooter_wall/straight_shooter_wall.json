It has a good variety of face and crack climbing with excellent position and exposure.  Also a plus, all belays are on huge ledges if done in 4 pitches.

Climb the clean varnished dihedral past 5 bolts to a small ledge (10d).

Continue until you reach an enormous ledge at the base of a chimney.  Belay with a great view. \n\n  P3 (80ft, 5.8): Avoid the ugly chimney by going  straight up the steep face (5.8) to a ledge system.  Walk rightwards across the ledge, battling trees and other desert flora (2nd class).  Belay underneath the obvious crack system. \n\n  P4 (200ft, 10d): The heart of the route.  Climb the widening splitter crack for 200 feet.  The pitch ends when the crack ends, at a huge ledge.  (Alternatively, this pitch may be broken into three pitches as the guidebook suggests: 60ft of 5.8 fingers to a piton belay in a slot; 60 feet of 10d thin hands to a belay in an alcove below a roof; 80 feet up the 10a hands and fist crack to the big ledge.) \n\n  Descent: Three rappels and downclimbing into The Beer and Ice Gully.   Rap 1: Walk across the ledge and rap off a tree.   Rap 2: Downclimb to the right (towards the gully) to another ledge and rap station at a tree.
