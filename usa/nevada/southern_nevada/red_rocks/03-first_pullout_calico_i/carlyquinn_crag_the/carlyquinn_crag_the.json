We realize that some leaders coming outside for their 1st leads on real rock may not be used to or prepared for the spacing of the protection bolts commonly found at many crags or areas. Thus, here you will find that most bolts are closely spaced, (with a few exceptions). Although we would never recommend skipping bolts or insinuate that doing so is safe or a good idea, we leave this decision to you as a leader. We feel that making such recommendations to others, is irresponsible, especially when you do not know who is apt to read, hear, or follow such suggestions. Rather, we would suggest that you decide for yourself which bolts you choose to clip, based on your comfort level on the terrain that you are climbing on, knowledge of the area, rock quality, leader skills, bolt\\anchor condition and careful consideration of the consequences of unexpected circumstances such as a hold breaking, etc..This area see's sun all day and is well protected from the wind and thus may be more suited to early morning\\late afternoons or cooler days. As with any new area, please be advised that there is likely to be loose rock and holds may break while climbing. It should clean up with traffic and will become solid with time. A helmet would be a good call!Have fun and be safe out there!The Quinny's "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":8,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:23.822Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:46.693Z"}
