It is the lefthand of two bolted lines and follows a vague, obtuse corner. The crux is the final move or two, including a deadpoint or long reach to the last hold - if you can find it! It is possible to top out and walk off the back.\n\n Use caution making clips - the rock is a bit hollow in spots and an attentive belay will go a long way towards keeping this experience safe.
