You might be wondering why three stars at the start of this climb, but by the time you get to the top you'll know this is a good route for sure.  Begin just left of Celebrity Roast, and head up and left through some slightly crumbly rock.  Head up some thin holds to a huge layback that seems like it will detach at any second....still wondering why three stars? Once past this section head through the cool layback features to a bulge.  Once here head up on some killer edges up to the crux where a sea of hand-hold look-a-likes hang out.  Here you must paw around until you find the right holds, and make a big move, far above the second to last bolt.  Clip, breathe a sigh of relief and climb up a few more pumpy holds to the top.","protection":"6 or 7 bolts to anchor.","location":"This is the second from the left."},"__v":0},{"_id":"bnwaU8xsXGCUGZD5I1hNcg==","name":"Quiet on the Set","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.42749,36.14677]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107527227","mp_crag_id":"107527149","climb_id":"bnwaU8xsXGCUGZD5I1hNcg==","areaRef":"5kHoZ4TjUjitT3iZ6+HboA=="},"content":{"description":"SSHHHH!!! not so loud!   This is the easiest sport route at the cliff, and climbing with quiet feet my help you stay on the set, since the holds are kind of fragile, so keep it down already.

I wouldn't come here just for this one, but it serves as a good warm up for the cliff.   \n\n  Start on the left end of the wall, and head up the arete like feature.

It seems that this little cliff has seen only a small amount of traffic in 20 years.     However, you should come and check this place out as this cliff boasts a handful of quite good routes.  It is further proof that even the less visited cliffs in Red Rock have some gems that are worth the 15 minute approach.  This cliff faces west and was shady well until mid afternoon.
