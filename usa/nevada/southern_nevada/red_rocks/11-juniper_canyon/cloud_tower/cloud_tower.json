Tiger Crack is a demanding pitch that calls upon a variety of skills. \n\n  Begin by schwacking through some scrub oak to a dirty little belay below a lichenous, low-angle hand crack in an alcove - this is just left of Crimson and immediately left of the obvious corner of Clod Tower.   \n\n  P1: Climb up the junky hand crack to a bolted belay atop a pedestal.  5.6 or so and totally doable in your Five Tennies. \n\n  P2: Three bolts of fingery climbing lead up an odd series of sidepulls and liebacks.  Certainly the crux for me but you crack-deprived Red Rocks locals might find this section relatively easy.  Footwork is key, but once you move right to the crack itself there is a rest.  Continue up the crack which is steep and leaning all the wrong ways.  Size changes and several cruxes ensure a solid pump.  Up higher you may be glad to have brought a #5 or #6 Camalot to protect a difficult move out of a wide section, but even after this very overhanging hand jams will keep you fighting right to the end. Some awkward moves up the dirty corner on the right or, more directly, sketchy moves up a final loose face lead to an anchor.","protection":"1 each 0.4-#6 Camalots   Extra #1's and #2's   Slings and draws","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Wylwch3DXxGH/6Gx+HDSnQ==","name":"Thagomizer","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Karsten Duncan, Lucas Krajnik, Johnny Ray, Larry DeAngelo","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.48908,36.11237]},"left_right_index":12,"mp_id":"106194021","mp_crag_id":"105732005","climb_id":"Wylwch3DXxGH/6Gx+HDSnQ==","areaRef":"MhL1L3slVIil04wdHHXuCg=="},"content":{"description":"Pitch 1: climb straight up the corner, passing a difficult section at an obvious bulge.  Pitch 2: continue up the crack system to a good ledge beneath a prominent chimney.  Pitch 3: climb the chimney to an overhang at its top, then belay on a ledge about 20 feet higher. \n\n  At this point the crack system has diverged from the main corner and reached an impasse beneath an unprotectable varnished headwall. The fourth pitch begins with a traverse right and up to gain the main corner at the lip of a giant overhang.  A committing move leads to a position of momentary security in the corner above.  Difficult climbing continues for another 40 feet until the angle begins to relent.  Easier climbing then leads to a large ledge on the very crest of the buttress. \n\n  Although we explored another pitch up the main crack system on the upper buttress, the climbing was loose, dirty, unpleasant, and not recommended. Especially because you are already standing on the walk-off descent ledge.\n\n Descent: There may be better ways to do this. . .  We walked west on the ledge system until reaching the first drainage.  We walked down and right (east) to a rappel from a large pine tree on the right edge of the drainage.  Two double-rope rappels led to the canyon floor. \n\n  A few other descent notes.  Although our rappel route was workable, it did not achieve the status of \"pleasant\" or \"relaxed,\" and I would readily consider other options.  Going straight down the drainage did not look like a good bet.  It turns into a dank chimney littered with shredded rope cores signifying an ancient epic.  Somewhere in this area I have heard of a hiking/mountaineering route that leads over west into the bowl beneath the Rainbow Wall.  I have not done this, and do not know precisely where it goes.  However, it seems like it might be a good way down if it could be easily reached. (And as we entered the descent drainage, we saw a few ducks, so it is possible we were right there. It may be necessary to go a little uphill to reach the bowl, and we were in a downhill frame of mind.)\n\n Historical notes: This is a prominent line, and I am sure many have wondered why no route has been recorded here.  In fact,the first three pitches have likely been done numerous times dating back to the 1970s.  We encountered a lot of old bail gear.  The top of the third pitch is kind of a dead end.  The continuation of the crack system becomes an unprotectable RURP seam.  It is climbable (we top-roped it), but it is hard enough that the sometimes crispy rock, and the lack of protection become serious factors.  The corner on the right looks outrageous, but ultimately tiptoes slightly inside the boundary of the insane. \n\n  The route is excellent, and despite earlier activity, has remained nameless. One common element in the naming of climbing routes is reference to the scorpion as symbol of \"the sting is in the tail.\"  Surely, this concept applied to this route with its spectacular top-pitch crux.  But we wanted something better...  The word \"thagomizer\" refers to the bony tail spikes of the stegosaurus.  The word has been recently adopted by paleontologists, inspired by a Far Side cartoon from 1982.  The cartoon shows a caveman giving a lecture to a bunch of other cavemen.  With his pointer he is indicating the tail section of a diagram of a stegosaurus, and he is saying to his assembled listeners, \"Now this end is called the thagomizer, after the late Thag Simmons.\"  Scientists adopted the term into their formal lexicon.  An image of the cartoon, and full explanation can be found here: \n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thago…","protection":"Protection: A full rack, with cams to 6\".

The buttress, in turn, is split by an obvious crack/corner system that reaches tantalizingly close to the top.  This is the route. \n\n  Probably the easiest way to approach is to hike up Juniper Canyon to the top of the steep section.  As the main canyon begins to level out, a brushy gully leads up through the band of cliffs on the left.

Mostly nuts, but small cams are a possibility. 2 bolt anchor at the top of the pitch. \n\n  Pitch 2 starts out with several good cam placements in a dihedral.  One #4 can be placed in the widest section of the dihedral. (wish I had one when I did it!)  The pitch then increases in difficulty and moves up and left over a bulge and onto the face.  The holds are very good, but there is no opportunity for gear placements until the anchors about 20 Ft away. Pitch 2 finishes with a 2 bolt anchor. 5.9- \n\n  Pitch 3 is a little confusing when you are at the start. There are 2 bolts strait above and one bolt way up to the right.  It looks like the route could be climbed by going strait up, but it would definitely bump up the grade on the climb.  The route is meant to go up and to the right over a small ledge.  We clipped the first bolt strait overhead and then traversed right about 15 Ft, clipped another bolt, then worked over the ledge.  This was the crux of the climb.  By clipping the first bolt overhead, it added a lot of head-game and safety benefit, but caused SERIOUS rope drag at the top of the pitch.  After pulling over the bulge and on the small ledge, move up and left to 2 more bolts.  Both are pretty runout in between.  After this, move strait up, through another seriously runout section, to a 2 bolt anchor.  However, do NOT set up your anchor here.  This is a hanging belay, but if you go up another 15 Ft, there is ANOTHER 2 bolt anchor on a fantastic ledge.  Power through and get to this ledge. A few small cam and nut placements are possible on this pitch and can help make the runouts better. 10.a/b   \n\n  Pitch 4 goes strait up through another runout section.

(Rack: I am embarrassed to confess having 3 each of 2.5-3.5 F, 2 4Fs and a 4 Camalot and using them all.)   \n\n  P5.  The Harding Slot of Red Rocks.  The guide describes climbing a scary offwidth to the top of the tower at 5.10+.  We climbed a short wide section (5.7) and then tunneled through the tower.  The crux was squeezing through a taper for about 3 feet onto the west face.  Not recommended for the bulbous or the claustrophobic.  Some friends have climbed to the top of the tower as the guide suggests, while others traversed the tower (climbed right from the belay around the tower).  No one has expressed great joy at the thought of repeating any of these options.  (5.?, 45-50') \n\n  P6.  After emerging from the birth canal, you are suddenly transplanted onto the west face of the tower at the base of a stellar Indian Creekish hand crack. Climb the flaring hand crack through several awkward bulges (5.11), while shedding as much clothing as you can remove.  Potential radical temperature difference after the north face experience.  Save a 1 camalot and some energy for the final hard moves to the belay.
