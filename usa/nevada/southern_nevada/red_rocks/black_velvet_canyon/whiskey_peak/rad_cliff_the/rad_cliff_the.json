His widow, Laura, graciously allowed me to sift through an entire trunk of slides and photographs that Randal had taken.  Among them was a picture of the the striking Cadillac Crack that had been taken in January, 1975.  At the time, Randal was at the beginning of what was to become an illustrious climbing career under the tutelage of local master Joe Herbst.  In light of Joe and Randal's friendship, and Joe's affinity for wide cracks, it is inconceivable to me that they did not climb this route.  The name was given by me, inspired by Randal's Chrysler Crack (this one is a nicer ride!).","protection":"Bring the usual rack, plus some large stuff in the six-inch range.
