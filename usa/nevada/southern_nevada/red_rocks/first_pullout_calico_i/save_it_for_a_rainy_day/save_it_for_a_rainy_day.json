You will see the obvious flat orange wall and pretty crack @25m up the hill on your right. As you pass the large boulders in the wash head up the hill to the base of the wall. The line takes the most direct route up the face. Both lines to the right and left have gone as well. \n\n  The gear is pretty straight forward: med stoppers, small cams( green c3-.75 bd), cams(#1-#3bd) and a few extendable runners. Chain anchors on top. It is possible to TR, but the chains are low. So, you may want to build an anchor to get to them. \n\n  Be safe, have fun and enjoy this fun crack climb!! Thanks Trundlebum for sharing this route with me!!","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a31fb323-0db7-5e02-b522-f21d3b49b531,eeabff85-bcb1-5aac-a784-2f3003d01d09,bea6bf11-de53-5046-a5b4-b89217b7e9bc,35ccf8bd-94cd-5890-888e-fcbcfd9cd69d,bf39b5b9-ca06-512a-96cb-121b7089a453","pathTokens":["USA","Nevada","Southern Nevada","Red Rocks","First Pullout (Calico I)","Save It For A Rainy Day"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12a/b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.42769,36.14514]},"bbox":[-115.42824683717156,36.14469033981813,-115.42713316282843,36.14558966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111947394","area_id":"vzm1ucoGUSqWyxIbcImkUw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.42824683717156,36.14469033981813],[-115.42713316282843,36.14469033981813],[-115.42713316282843,36.14558966018186],[-115.42824683717156,36.14558966018186],[-115.42824683717156,36.14469033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"At least three lines here have gone."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:23.805Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:08.661Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"6594e427f8258fb5bda02a4f","prevHistoryId":"6594c98bf8258fb5bd9f0c73","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
