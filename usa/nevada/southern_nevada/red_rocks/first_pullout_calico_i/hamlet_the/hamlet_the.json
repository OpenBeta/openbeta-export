The wall is comprised of two tiers. The upper tier is where you will find the sport climbing. Three of these routes start in a shaded slot canyon that is usually cool year round. The majority of the toprope lines are on the lower tier and are serviced by three sets of glue-in anchors. The rock is fairly well traveled and has shed most of its loose and questionable holds over the years. A great spot for new climbers and intermediate leaders.The Hamlet and The J Wall :The The J Wall is a collection of three sport routes directly to the left of the Hamlet top rope area. Confusion by visiting climbers has led to these routes sometimes being mistaken for the sport routes on the upper section of the Hamlet.
