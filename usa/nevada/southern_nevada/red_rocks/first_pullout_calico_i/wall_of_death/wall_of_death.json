It's kind of like a combination of the most dangerous routes on Annapurna and K2 put together...except the wall's not at altitude, the lines are tightly bolted, the rock is good, the lines are 40 to 50-feet tall, it's usually warm, and it's only a 15-minute approach. Aside from those facts, it's really really really dangerous. \n\n  The Wall of Death is like that movie, The Ring. If you look at it - even from the parking lot - you'll probably die...someday. This place is sketchier than a 20-year-old bro trying to \"teach\" his girlfriend how to climb. I mean, it's even sketchier than some of the advice given in the forum section of this website... \n\n  So what' I'm saying is don't go here... You'll be scared the whole time and it will scar you for life. \n\n  Aside from that, here's some beta: \n\n  This is a west facing crag in the Calico Hills. The belays for the right-hand side of the crag are shaded by a giant fin of rock (that will probably topple over and kill everyone in Las Vegas some day).  \n\n  The rock is mostly good. It will continue to clean up as more people climb at the area. But it's unlikely anyone will ever come here, because this is the WALL OF DEATH."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:19.225Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:06.493Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"6594e427f8258fb5bda02a4f","prevHistoryId":"6594c98bf8258fb5bd9f0c73","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
