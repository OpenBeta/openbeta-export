At one point in its history The Slab was predominately top rope only and contained just a handful of climbs. Over time it has grown into a full blown sport crag. It hosts climbs from 5.5 to 5.10, the majority of which trend toward the lower end of that range. The Slab offers entry level sport climbing with one of the shortest approaches in the 03-First Pullout (Calico I). Several easy routes (e.g. Slab One, Slab Line, and To Slab or Not) make this a great area for beginners. \n\n  The Slab Wall started out with only one bolted route (Smear Campaign) put up by Jason Martin, Mark Fulmer, and Glen Owen in 2007; and three top-rope routes/anchors put up by Mark Limage and Jake Burkey (originally referred to as Slab #1, Slab #2, and Slab #3 in Jason Martin's 2009 guidebook, Fun Climbs Red Rocks, but now Slab One, Slab Line, and To Slab or Not). Seeing the potential of the wall, Gene Scott added eleven new lines and also bolted the top-ropes as leadable sport climbs. \n\n  Some of the rock at the slab is suspect. Hollow and or flexing flakes of rock can be found on the lower and mid level portions of some of the routes. A helmet would not be unwarranted for the belayer as these routes continue to clean up. \n\nTop Rope Access Anchor\n\n  There is an anchor on the upper ridge above The Slab roughly in line with the center of the wall. It can be used to rappel to the shelf were several of the sport anchors are located to setup top ropes sans leading the routes. Keep in mind that not all finishing anchors found here can be accessed by utilizing this anchor as some dip off the edge of the shelf and others are not located on it at all. Hiking out far left then up the ridge to get to the anchor is about a 10-15 minute endeavor."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":15,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:23.804Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:15.780Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"6594e427f8258fb5bda02a4f","prevHistoryId":"6594c98bf8258fb5bd9f0c73","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
