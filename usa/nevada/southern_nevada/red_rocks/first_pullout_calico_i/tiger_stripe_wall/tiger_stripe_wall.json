A few of the routes here are longer, cleaner, and more fun than most in the area at the grade and make a good partial day of climbing.  The wall sports 4 known routes plus variations and TR's, all of them being sunny for most of the day in the winter. \n\n  The wall is beautiful and photogenic alone due to the inter-folded strata and sedimentation and erosion lines.   \n\n  The drawbacks of this area are the shady belay down in a trench at the base, the cat-claw bushes at the base of 'Tigger' and a constant stream of people walking by. \n\n  Take a rack of draws (10+) and a light rack. If you wish to do the route Bengal, add an Offwidth rack of wide gear as well. Beware that a longer rope is advantageous for single-rope raps or lower offs from the longer routes. If I recall correctly, a 50M will not allow lower-offs from at least two of the routes.
