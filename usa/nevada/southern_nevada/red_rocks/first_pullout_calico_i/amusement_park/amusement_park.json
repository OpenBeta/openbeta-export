It is shaded in the afternoon, generally around 1:00 pm. This crag is cold in the winter but nice in the warmer months. The Amusement Park is directly below and faces the Panty Wall. \n\n  If you are a beginner, you will most likely have a fun day at the Amusement Park. If you are not a beginner, you might be slightly bored. \n\n  There are 4 hook anchors shared between the 9 climbing lines. Just drop your rope into the hooks and top rope/lower off dirctly from the hooks. Each of the first three anchors from left to right are shared with 2 routes each. The fourth (farthest right) anchor has 3 climbing lines shared. \n\n  All routes are initially graded 5.7, but some might be 5.6 or 5.8. Please fill in what you think the grades are for each.
