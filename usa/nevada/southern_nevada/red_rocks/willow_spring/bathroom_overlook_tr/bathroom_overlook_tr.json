Multiple routes can be taken with little risk of dangerous pendulum. Low angle at the bottom and becoming steeper at the top. One must carry all the gear up to set up the TR and one must break down the TR and hike back down. This route should not be rapped and have the rope pulled over the lip (it would eat your rope too). No Grooves have been cut into the lip of this climb and the anchor has been here for a couple of years. The route sees little traffic and it would be nice to keep it as pristine as possible. - This Route will need a long extension to run the master point over the lip.","protection":"Top Rope","location":"Once the TR is set up. Climbers can take a well defined trail, from all the day hikers, behind the bathrooms. Look for ropes that have been set up, walking directly toward the cliff, taking path or least resistance. Note, access is not good if starting from under the large overhang near the picnic area, it is best to walk to the south side of the Bathroom and then start working ones way toward the base of the cliffs. "},"__v":0},{"_id":"rif9HCqFVBu+vg6KnXAYSg==","name":"Mama H","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.49795,36.16138]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118182050","mp_crag_id":"114321449","climb_id":"rif9HCqFVBu+vg6KnXAYSg==","areaRef":"AQr3ddujVXmdlyG4IG2azQ=="},"content":{"description":"No real crux, maybe the top out.  Pretty easy, sustained the whole climb.  I didn't want to scramble from the side to setup top rope so I followed the crack to the left of \"Unnamed\" Bathroom overlook climb.\n\n As a newer trad climber it was a bit tricky to find protection.  Set of nuts or small cams up to #2 worked fine for me.  I placed 4-5 pieces.\n\n The 2 bolted anchor for the TR \"Unnamed\" climb is to the right of the top out and is about 5 feet from the edge.  Bring long cords or slings if you're planning on setting up TR.","protection":"Set of nuts, Cams up to #2.  2 bolt anchor with rings.","location":"Behind the Restrooms next to the picnic benches.  Scramble right of the restrooms up to a big flat ledge."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a31fb323-0db7-5e02-b522-f21d3b49b531,eeabff85-bcb1-5aac-a784-2f3003d01d09,bea6bf11-de53-5046-a5b4-b89217b7e9bc,f5ee4241-acff-5bb1-9144-10a0a7e23c4e,010af775-dba3-5579-9d97-21b8206d9acd","pathTokens":["USA","Nevada","Southern Nevada","Red Rocks","Willow Spring","Bathroom Overlook TR"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.49795,36.16138]},"bbox":[-115.49850695250056,36.16093033981814,-115.49739304749944,36.161829660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114321449","area_id":"AQr3ddujVXmdlyG4IG2azQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.49850695250056,36.16093033981814],[-115.49739304749944,36.16093033981814],[-115.49739304749944,36.161829660181866],[-115.49850695250056,36.161829660181866],[-115.49850695250056,36.16093033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Sunny, South west facing.
