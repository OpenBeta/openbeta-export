There is an old section of blue rope tied around a suspect but ok flake about 10' above P1 belay. I found no signs of climber activity above that rope. My guess is that P1 was climbed and bailed from years past. \n\n  P1: Scramble up cracks and slabs to some low angle terrain. A few more moves gain a nice sized ledge with a great 1\" and 2\" crack belay. 5.5 80' \n\n  P2: Move left of the belay to the right facing corner and make your way up. The climbing is somewhat sustained through the crack, well protected and enjoyable for a short time. There is quite a bit of loose rock up towards the top. I clipped a sling around one sturdy chockstone for pro and you have no choice but to climb right over some less compelling versions. 5.8 100' \n\n  To descend we gained the next major ledges above the route. On the north east side of this ledge I slung webbing around a large chunk of rock. One single rope rappel gets you back to the top of P1, 90' Rope stretch keeps you from popping off the ends. We then left a carabiner and rapped off the old blue tat rope on the detatched flake above P1 belay back to base.","protection":"Single rack to 3\".","location":"Up past the main waterfall a few hundred yards into the mouth of Lost Creek Canyon.

Above the bush locate a bolt about 20ft up the face. Climb past the bolt and pull the bulge above(you'll be alittle runout), leading to another crack. Pitch 1 is 5.10- Belay at the obvious stance with fixed knots!! Pitch 2 starts up the obvious crack then heads right on the face towards a bolt, you'll want the bolt to be above you on the traverse. Turn the corner of the arete and find another bolt. From here there are 2 option's. Option 1; continue across the obvious varnished face, on very poor(breakable) holds until you reach a bolt(5.11+). Option 2; head straight up the arete until you reach an obvious horizontal hand traverse then climb right to the aforementioned bolt(5.10). From the bolt head up the obvious varnished corner, thru an easier section then up another varnished corner. Belay on the left side of the big ledge below some bush's. Pitch 3 Climb a shallow right facing varnished corner then up a white face, passing a bolt to a 2 bolt anchor(5.9).It is possible and recommended to link pitch's 3&4. Pitch 4 Climb the varnished face past a bolt aiming for the obvious right leaning crack. Continue up the crack to the summit (you'll once again be a little runout) and belay off of fixed gear in the summit boulder (5.10). \n\n  To descend rappel off the fixed gear in the summit boulder to the bolt anchor at the top of pitch 3. From the top of pitch 3 rappel to an anchor on a ledge to the right of the route- 2 ropes are needed one 70M will not work.
