I suppose naming a cliff after them is the next best thing!  \n\n        This cliff is a fantastic gem hidden in plain sight a few hundred yards past the children's crag in willow springs. If you enjoy routes like \"peaches\" or \"tonto\" i believe that the classics of the mother's crag are just as great. The crag reminds me of home (the gunks) in that the quality and excitement of the climbing are high despite the difficulty being low. This crag has easy roadside access with morning sun and afternoon shade.  It shares the same orientation as the Children's Crag and Ragged Edges.  It is fairly secluded despite its easy access and the rock quality is superb.  \n\n  NOTE:  all routes rappel from the tree above motorcycle mama with one 60 meter rope.  i did not see an easy way to gain the top of this crag (besides leading the climbs;)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:24.896Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:57.734Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"6594e4e2f8258fb5bda03896","prevHistoryId":"6594c98bf8258fb5bd9f0c73","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
