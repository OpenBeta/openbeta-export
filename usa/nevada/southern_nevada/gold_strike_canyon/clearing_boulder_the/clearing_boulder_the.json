The granite here will hold up better than the sandstone at Red Rocks. The boulder only has one problem on it at the moment and there's not much potential for more, but the problem it does have is pretty good compared to the rest of the canyon. Besides the hot springs are fairly nearby from here so if you're headed there and have a pad, might as well check it out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:26.646Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:50.573Z"}
