Do a move to a bad left hand crimp. Move your right hand up a bit and then do a big move to a big juggy edge. From there move up through the opening in the boulders to the top. The top is where a spotter is handy as a fall from here will likely result in smacking your back on the boulder behind you as fall. This is a good warm-up problem on granite that is much better than what can be found in the rest of the canyon.","protection":"Pad and a spotter.","location":"Once you've reached the boulder garden, follow the trail over the boulders to the bottom of the wash, then turn right and look for a big cave above a 6 ft boulder.
