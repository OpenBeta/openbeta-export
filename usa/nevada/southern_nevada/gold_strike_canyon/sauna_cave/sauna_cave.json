Start traversing now for bonus moves, or get on top and walk to the other side where eventually you'll end up making some climbing moves to get back to the water. Commit to getting wet now or keep traversing. After a short distance, the climbing and water become one when an alcove weeping with water and ferns is reached. Continue along the base of the cliff or go a little ways out to a sandbar. If you reach the Nevada gravel dumps, then you've gone just a bit too far. \n\n  The river level changes by several feet a couple times a day as water is released from the dam.

At the top of this on the right side are two old ladders attached to the cliff. Climb the ladders to gain the top of the cliff. Some of the rungs spin, some are missing, and the wood is old and splintered. \n\n  From here, the trail contours north across the tops of cliffs to the Nevada gravel dumps. Drop straight down to the river at this point, along the edge of the gravel slide. Follow the base of the cliff to the right downriver. The Sauna Cave is a short distance away up a small sandbar behind some tamarisk. \n\n  These ladders are part of a trail that predates the dam, and that was built to assay Black Canyon and access water gauging stations. Most of the trail, which used cable cars to span side canyons and catwalks to traverse cliffs, has deteriorated into oblivion. The section that accesses the Willow Beach gauging station has been maintained and is worth seeing. \n\n  The Nevada and Arizona gravel dumps were created when the canyon walls were scraped and the river bottom dredged to reach good bedrock for the dam. The Nevada gravel dump is on the border of the controlled access zone for Hoover Dam but the only signage is at the bottom on a cable that spans the river. The Dam Police also keep a small gun range in the gravel dumps just above where the trail dives into the gravel. I highly recommend not wandering through the dumps as the police don't like unexpected sightseers and trespassing here, in this day & age of 'shoot first & figure it out later,' is no joke.","protection":"Self","location":"About a quarter mile up from the river is a drop-off in the wash made of stacked boulders. The trail avoids this by skirting across the top of a muddy cliff on the north side.

The Sauna Cave is a 50' tunnel cut into a wall of Black Canyon on the Nevada side that ended up tapping into a hot spring. At the end of the tunnel the water is too hot to touch, so planks have been placed to reach the back where air temperatures are about 120-130F (depending on the season). The water is of a tolerable temperature by the time it reaches the entrance, which is a few feet above the sandy bank behind some tamarisk. A low concrete wall channels the water through a spillway and forms a small waterfall here. Blocking this spillway (with your body) makes a shallow, but nice and hot pool."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:25.972Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:13.582Z"}
