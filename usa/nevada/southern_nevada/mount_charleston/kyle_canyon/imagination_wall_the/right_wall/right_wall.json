Layback the corner and undercling the overlap to get to better holds. Head mostly straight up past a few bolts, clipping your last bolt before running it out 15 feet on easy (but very chossy) terrain to the anchor. The rock on the bottom is quality, but deteriorates from the last bolt to the anchor. Additionally, the crux is off the ground. Perhaps consider stick clipping the second bolt and possibly wearing a helmet (particularly as a belayer).","protection":"4 bolts to rings shared with \"Mary Weeks Arete\"","location":"This climb starts immediately left of the very large ramp that heads up and right on the right side of the Imagination wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"2AZCcf33W5WX/KJ5pzPR3g==","name":"Mary Weeks Arete","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Tom Beck","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.66287,36.2617]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106837940","mp_crag_id":"105859074","climb_id":"2AZCcf33W5WX/KJ5pzPR3g==","areaRef":"gke21DG2U4Kssjq0A+AbVg=="},"content":{"description":"Climb slabby arete.","protection":"5 bolts to rings shared with \"Who Done It?\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Anf8w4CEUJiYxFuTMzEvtA==","name":"Killer Diller","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"Dan Meyers & Mike Ward","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.66287,36.2617]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106031533","mp_crag_id":"105859074","climb_id":"Anf8w4CEUJiYxFuTMzEvtA==","areaRef":"gke21DG2U4Kssjq0A+AbVg=="},"content":{"description":"5 bolts lead to a bulge and two more bolts put you at the crux.
