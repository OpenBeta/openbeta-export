(5.11-) Lean right from the chains and use the jug to move rightward, then upward to the first bolt.  Move back left over the belay, and then basically straight up through thin sharp holds, and several different types and quality of rock to reach a nice little ledge below the roof.  11 bolts. 115'.\n\n Pitch 3.  (5.10) Tiptoe right from the anchor.  Clip 2 bolts to establish under the roof, and the 3rd above your head (long draw).  Lean out and left to either a side pull or lower crimp, then bumping your hands and feet through a series of adequate holds to get through some balance oriented moves.  Above is a real treat: smooth, sand-colored stone with a short crack that leads to another bulge.
