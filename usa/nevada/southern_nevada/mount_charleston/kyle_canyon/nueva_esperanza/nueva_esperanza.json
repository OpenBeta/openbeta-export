It is nicely situated about 2 minutes off the Mary Jane Falls trail, but it is perfectly hidden and quiet.\n\n The challenge with this wall is deciding when to climb there. It faces due south and is very sunny.  It is best very early in the morning during the summer, or all day when it is below 85 degrees in the valley (and you are in Red Rock). The best day I have had here was on New Years Eve (when it was about 70 in the valley).  The 65-85 degree window is ideal here (temps in Las Vegas, not on the mountain).  March and April tend to yield excellent conditions as does the fall.   Perhaps it will be a welcome escape in the Spring/Fall compared to waiting in lines at Red Rock. In the summer, the central slab gets sun by 9:30am and does not go back into shade until 4:30pm. The right wall stays in shade until about 11am. The 3 routes on the left wall get shade from the big pine tree and are pretty much always shaded.\n\n Thank you to those who contributed to developing this cliff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":20,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:28.140Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:52.530Z"}
