Itâ€™s made up of excellent basalt (only a little crumbly!) and has a fair amount of bouldering with sit down starts to almost highball problems. The short cliffs that line the sides of this drainage, and a nipple of a hill that rises up from the wash, also have good but fractured rock with a few easy boulder problems and trad climbs. Kent Dirby is the first climber known to have visited the area back around 1990."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:27.077Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:15.111Z"}
