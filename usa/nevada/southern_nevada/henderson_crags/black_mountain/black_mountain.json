The slender north-south, sometimes knife-edge ridge, is a fun and adventurey hike. The mountain is made up of basalt and granite. The west side is complete choss but the east side has excellent rock and most of the granite with many cliff facets worthy of climbs. The only reason that there arenâ€™t a bunch of sport and mixed climbs across the east side is the ease of access vs quantity ratio. All of the good cliffs are a ways up very steep hillside, are small, and spread out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:27.078Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:00.882Z"}
