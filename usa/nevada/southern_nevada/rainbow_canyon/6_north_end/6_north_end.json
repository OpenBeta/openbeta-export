Trail a tag line and rap or lower from anchor over to the Up the Junction anchor and belay your second up.

I spent the better part of a day taking off some of the biggest and scariest blocks I have ever come across. There was an old bolt at the lip that had some ancient webbing on it that looked like it had been used to bail off. The seam/crack above the bolt was filled with grass and dirt. If this route has been done before please let me know and I will be happy to change the name, FA whatever. Its now a super nice route with good rock, after you get by the opening 30ft.Start 30ft right of Fade to Gray below an obvious tree. Climb/stem up the first 30ft past the tree to get to the headwall split by a ledge. Pull the headwall and up the seam (crux) to great climbing up slab to anchor.Descent: From top anchor lower to the Up the Junction anchor cleaning gear. Pull the rope, then carry on down from the Up the Junction anchor with a 70M ROPE to ground.","protection":"Bolts.
