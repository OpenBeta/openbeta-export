There're no fixed anchors on top and the descent is a 5.2 ramp/crack from the southeast corner, it's easy and only exposed for a move or two. There's bouldering on big rocks on all sides. Under one of these large boulders at the base on the east side is Knob Hill Spring, which is the main water source in the area for critters. Trappers use this place and we've found leg traps around the base on several occasions. At least two climber's dogs have been caught in them over the years so be aware."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:27.649Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:01.969Z"}
