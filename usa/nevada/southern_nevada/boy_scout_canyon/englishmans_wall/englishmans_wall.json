The wash is only about four feet wide here and the other side is a low-angle cliff that makes this into a little corridor. There is good, hard climbing on this wall. But to fully take advantage of it it would be good to have a buddy move crash pads across the low-angle rock behind you. Morning sun and afternoon shade."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:28.590Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:24.132Z"}
