Don't let the dirt discourage you...Its steep and varied with great movement.   \n\n  Begins at a very prominent left facing corner on the left side of the entry walls.

The rock is a bit slick but the moves up to here are only about 5.8. \n\n  Stem and Jam up the initial corner clipping 2 bolts (long slings recommended). This gains a large ledge with some loose blocks (be careful). Clip up off the ledge and reach to a good rail. Climb the tan face up to a steepening section with big moves between good holds (5.11) and some huge pockets and underclings. A rest is reached under a small roof on the right.
