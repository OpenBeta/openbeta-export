One look at the buttery-smooth limestone at the base of the Entrance Walls climbs should tell you everything you need to know about the incredible volumes of water which can pass through the canyon.**\n\nAn impressive limestone slot canyon located about an hour from Las Vegas. The area is of cultural significance to the ancient Moapa people as evidenced by the high concentration of petroglyphs found throughout the canyon, most notably in the Entrance Walls area. For this reason the BLM instituted a total ban on all new bolting and fixed hardware in 2013, with several existing routes slated for removal due to proximity to the artwork. Please show respect for the area while climbing here; do not disturb the petroglyphs or add to the already-plentiful modern graffiti surrounding it.\n\nThough the area may never be developed further, Arrow Canyon is still worth the visit. A handful of &lt;=5.10 gives way to a majority population of 5.11 to 5.12+, though serious crushers will want to try the 5.13+ lines of the Swamp Cave, or even the two 5.14d's of the monstrous Millennium Cave set by Jonathan Siegrist in 2012.\n\nApproach: 4WD/high clearance recommended for the \"east end approach\" described here. From Vegas, leave I-15 N at Moapa exit 90. From the bottom of the exit ramp, drive exactly 10.9 miles to a ranch-style gate on the left which appears to be (and is) a driveway towards a house. Stay to the right, following the BLM signs around the house and a fenced-in water utility building to reach the first parking lot. Continue 1.3mi over much rougher road to the second parking lot, where the trailhead to the canyon is clearly indicated by an SNCC/BLM signpost. Hike up the wash about 20 minutes to the Entrance Walls, allowing about an hour to reach the very deepest end of the canyon, which ends in a dam."},"density":8,"totalClimbs":40,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:29.723Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:12:01.455Z","_change":{"user":"r+dsfMIkSfaom8ncBjZa9Q==","historyId":"6434416afbd9321d4819dd22","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"updatedBy":"r+dsfMIkSfaom8ncBjZa9Q=="}
