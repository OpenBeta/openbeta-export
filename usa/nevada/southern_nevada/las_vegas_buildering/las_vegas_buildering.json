Rest up a bit and tackle the crux (two uncharacteristically difficult moves involving a bad crimp and a chossy pinch) pulling over the roof to the left at the base of the final section of facade to the top. The end is easy V1-V2 climbing for about another 20 feet until you mantle over to a small balcony just below the bell. You cannot climb any further as the stone facade ends at this point.
