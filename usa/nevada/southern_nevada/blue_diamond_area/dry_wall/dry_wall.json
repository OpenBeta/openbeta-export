The rock is a bit dusty at times. A brush may help until (and if) these see traffic. All the routes have been here for many years and FA's are all unknown.  Location is ~: 36.045, -115.392There are 8 (maybe more) routes.  There are 6 routes with wedge bolts and climbtech hangers.  Some of these have mussies.  Caution should be taken on all routes in this area as they have likely not seen more than one or two ascents, the rock in the entire area is a mix of good rock and total choss, and there may be partially completed routes near or among them. The wedge bolt routes from Left to Right are something like this:1. Reverend Horton Hunsinger 5.9 (7 Bolts to Mussies)  (Left of the routes on the black bulging bottom wall with a larger gray panel above.)2. 40 Days and 40 Nights 5.10B (7 Bolts to Mussies)3. Life Crux 5.11+/12-4. Go and Send No More 5.11A5. Tears in Rain 5.11A6. Twilight of a Gumby 5.10BNone of these have anything remotely close to consensus ratings...so take the above with a healthy grain of salt. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:28.591Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:53.585Z"}
