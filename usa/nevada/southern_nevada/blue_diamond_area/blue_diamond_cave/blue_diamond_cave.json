This crag is on the left side of a 1/2 mile + long cliff band that wraps around to the town of Blue Diamond. The wall enjoys southern exposure making it a wonderful climbing area for the cooler months. The Limestone and short approach / commute also makes this wall a good option for when moisture hits Red Rocks. The king lines and prime routes are located in the overhanging section of wall where the approach trail meets the cliff. There are numerous high quality 5.12's and 5.13's to pick from with many of the climbs enjoying fixed permadraws. To the left of the cave is about 200 feet worth of vertical technical face climbing with enjoyable 5.10's. To the right of the overhang is a never-ending ban of chaos but with substantial trundling there will surely be additional routes added to the mix.WARNING: The natural quality of the rock in and around the cave is really, really bad. It required a lot of vision and a ton of work for the original developers to turn what is essentially a giant choss pile into a fairly stacked cliff with a bunch of enjoyable routes. Even if you don't normally helmet up for sport climbing, having one on the belayer isn't a bad idea. That being said, the routes have cleaned up immensely from their natural state, thanks to trundling, traffic, and glue. Most of the rockfall will come from getting off-route or whipping onto a dirty section of rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":38,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:28.591Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:17.892Z"}
