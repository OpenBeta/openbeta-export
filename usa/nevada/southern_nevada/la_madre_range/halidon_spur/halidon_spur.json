The last pitch is the steepest and holds both the mental and physical crux of the route. The physical crux is protected by a good fixed pin in solid rock. After the crux the cliff turns from solid to stacked blocks that won't hold  a fall (mental crux) and although the second half of this pitch essentially a solo, the climbing gets steadily easier. There are many ledges and a goodly amount of loose rock on this route. Descent: Hike east across the top of the escarpment until you can cut back southwest down the huge ramp system that's just east of the spur. One or two single rope rappels from fixed pins, or sketchy down climbing, are required near the bottom.","protection":"Stoppers, cams- TCUs up to 4\".
