It's a sunny, south-facing wall which offers protection from a north wind, warmth on a wintery day, and decent quality limestone. The approach is no Gun Club parking-lot-hop, but it's mild by RR standards, and mostly flat, save the last steep bit of the approach from the wash to the base of the climbs. Added bonus, that little bit of distance means you'll likely have the place to yourself. The view is lovely, and you can't take a step without tripping over one fascinating fossil after another. Climbs are varied, with unique features, and a bit of a grade range to suit different wants and needs. It might be worth the hike even if only to check out the mother of all batshit-crazy guano-filled mini-caves. Absolutely worth a day's visit.For best beta please check out Mojave Limestone, A Rock Climber's Guide\n\nmojavelimestone.com/"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:27.078Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:00.913Z"}
