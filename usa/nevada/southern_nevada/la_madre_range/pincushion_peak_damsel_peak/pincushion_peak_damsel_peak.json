Tricams are your friends. The gear was actually pretty good!  \n\n  About 8 slings, cordalettes for odd anchor setups. While there is loose rock around it it was really pretty clean climbing.

Integrity Ridge is at times difficult to distinguish, and other times plainly obvious, as the limestone blends into the other faces in the area. It can be seen nearly anywhere from town.
