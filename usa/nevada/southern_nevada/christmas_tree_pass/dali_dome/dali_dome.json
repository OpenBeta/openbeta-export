Improbably thin flake, dubious pro at a modest grade: fantastic and a bit frightening.P1: ascend the low angle corner, then, transition to a crack on the right, then another, gaining the two bolt belay anchor at the base of the steep flake. 5.4 70'.P2: Climb the thin flake feature. Two bolts protect at stances (old Rawl buttonheads with thin SMC hangers in need of replacement). Move up, then right, then up and finally turn the low angle roof and gain the two bolt rappel anchor (with a spare older belay bolt). 5.7 125'.Either rappel the route, or, continue to the top via the low angle crack (150 feet, easy 5th class).If rappelling, fixed anchor available at the end of P1 and P2. Take care with the rope to avoid getting it stuck in the crack. Near the top of the last pitch, not far from the summit, there's a large flake which would require leaving a large cordalette (or similar) for a rappel anchor, if needed.Walk off behind the Dome and back around to the climber's left.Take care on the fragile flexi flake. Amazing feature but, who knows for how much longer?The route name must be in reference to the maker of razor blades...","protection":"Gear to include at least a double set of cams in the .5 to 3 camalot (or equivalent) range.

Follow the drainage down, through large boulders and lovely spikey foliage, to the base of the dome and the approach hike trail/road.   \n\n  Suggest either leaving a pack near the bottom of the hike (prior to scrambling up to the base of the route) or, carrying all gear up the route if the intent is to top out the dome, to avoid having to scramble up to the base of the route again."},"__v":0},{"_id":"9puF3lImWiu5EaQPvhHCwQ==","name":"Tough Animals","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"Bob Turner and Joe Hancock, 1982","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.71166,35.24816]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"106667761","mp_crag_id":"106148133","climb_id":"9puF3lImWiu5EaQPvhHCwQ==","areaRef":"tZX/rtBTXGmwUg+nwWdeAA=="},"content":{"description":"Bolted slab route.
