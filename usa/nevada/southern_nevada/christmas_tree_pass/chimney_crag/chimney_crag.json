Protection is in the crack in the back of the chimney. If you fall, you fall out of it. Extremely strenuous. When I was 5'8\" tall & 142#, I rated this thing 5.10d. One of the other six people who were present when I finally led it claimed it was only 5.9. But, he was only 5'4\" tall and he couldn't lead it.   The first time I tried it, my legs weren't strong enough. So, I found a parking garage near my home that had smooth, precast, double horizontal concrete beams. I worked out in that garage regularly for nearly 3 months then bagged the route on my next attempt.  -Andy Solow","protection":"nuts or friends in a small to medium finger to hand size crack","location":"Located at Chimney Crag/Dr. Bombay Area."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a31fb323-0db7-5e02-b522-f21d3b49b531,eeabff85-bcb1-5aac-a784-2f3003d01d09,253994bd-47c9-5547-bcdc-f96186d652dd,509bfc59-816b-50c4-b0e8-8037dcaf00af","pathTokens":["USA","Nevada","Southern Nevada","Christmas Tree Pass","Chimney Crag"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.70904,35.24815]},"bbox":[-114.70959060867105,35.247700339818145,-114.70848939132898,35.24859966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113955036","area_id":"UJv8WYFrUMSw6IA33K8Arw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.70959060867105,35.247700339818145],[-114.70848939132898,35.247700339818145],[-114.70848939132898,35.24859966018186],[-114.70959060867105,35.24859966018186],[-114.70959060867105,35.247700339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"200' crag left and uphill from Dali Dome camp and right of the large formation immediately right of the Razor's Edge.  "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:26.642Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:14.503Z"}
