From there, you step left and make some thin moves off the ledge to stand on a crimpy edge and clip the last bolt.  You'll run into some exfoliation at the top of the third pitch so climb weight distributed.  Run it to safer ground. Easy to set gear anchor at the summit.  Descent is scramble climbers right around a bulge in the middle of the white slab and solo or short rope your way to the chains located under the bulge.  A 70 m may get you down without incident.
