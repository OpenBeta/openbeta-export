Joe and Betsy Herbst, Mike and Stephanie Petrolak, John Shirley, Lynn Powers, Bob and Wanda Gallup, Joanne and Jorge Urioste, Team Keyhole and many others have scoured this wall for climbs over and over. Pretty much every square inch of this cliff has been top roped and all of the cracks have been led. The idea of giving these climbs names didn't occur to the early climbers. All of the names were developed over the years and added as newer climbers showed up and led old top ropes or needed a way to reference the climbs. Shark Fin is the earliest known name and only exception to this. All of the climbs use gear for belays."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:11:27.084Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:50.872Z"}
