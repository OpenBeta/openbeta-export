It hits a ledge and then the business, a 30 some foot off width section. It starts with #4 cams and opens up big enough for Bigbros at the top.\n\nNot quite sure of the history on this, but it's the most obvious splitter from the road in Spring Creek. We cleaned it heavily and found a pin down very low, but nothing else that would have indicated it had been done before. We left a sling around a horn up there, so it could definitely use some anchors. It is a sweet off-width crack!\n\nIf you know more about this, or an original name feel free to comment. We named it after my friend's cat, Porkchop, and H.A.M. is a Jay Z song (Hard as a Motherf**er).","protection":"Small gear all the way to offwidth (#4 Camalot to #4 Bigbro).","location":"This is the main route on this wall, up the obvious splitter."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,933b93aa-def6-5be5-b363-1d4e2f419e6d,96bc2195-ad64-5168-9987-94e1da2112a0,5be293b5-9d9a-5c76-9726-b9dc496fda8b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Gunnison","Spring Creek","Porkchop Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.7702,38.756]},"bbox":[-106.77077662126844,38.75555033981814,-106.7696233787316,38.75644966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107292498","area_id":"W+KTtZ2aXHaXJrncSW/aiw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.77077662126844,38.75555033981814],[-106.7696233787316,38.75555033981814],[-106.7696233787316,38.75644966018187],[-106.77077662126844,38.75644966018187],[-106.77077662126844,38.75555033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:47.256Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:56.483Z"}
