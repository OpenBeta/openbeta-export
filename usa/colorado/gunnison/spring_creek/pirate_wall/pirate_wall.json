It starts with 2 black bolts and is obvious. Good climb and very well-bolted. There are some decent rests as well as a little knee bar at the third bolt which isn't really needed but fun. There is potential for placing gear on the last part of the climb, as it is a great finger crack. So bring some cams if you're into that sort of thing.","protection":"9 bolts to anchors. There is a finger crack up top that will eat cams but there are bolts there as well. Very small cams would be needed.","location":"On the main wall there are two sport climbs. I haven't climbed the left line, so I won't post anything about it. Loose Canon takes the right line of bolts.
