Hike 10-15 minutes up the gully until you see a large tree leaning against the face.  Start about 15 feet up the gully from  the tree on the face.\n\nPitch 1:  start out climbing the face.  The face gets lower angle and leads to a large ledge with a tree on it. Belay at the tree. 5.8.\n\nPitch 2:  from the tree, climb straight up the gully to another large ledge (easy climbing) to a knife edge ridge.  Climb up the ridge a ways and set a belay at another ledge on the ridge. 5.4.\n\nPitch 3:  keep climbing the ridge until another large ledge below a face with a crack splitting the face. 5.4.\n\nPitch 4:  climb the crack that splits the face up to another large ledge and traverse to the summit.  Really fun pitch!! 5.6.\n\nDescent: downclimb from the summit to the south.  You will be able to see some cord wrapped on some good blocks.
