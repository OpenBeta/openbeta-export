This route takes the path of least resistance up the center of the wall. Avoid the thin dihedral by starting left, then avoid the imposing OW roofs by escaping right to another corner. This climb tops out and then follows a ridgeline to descend east into the Escalator Gully.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,933b93aa-def6-5be5-b363-1d4e2f419e6d,a741e3c4-a44e-53cd-b85f-cd6171faf201,c6d25dbf-9225-50d5-a93c-3ca18a65e64b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Gunnison","Gate View Canyon","Escalator Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.928,38.5448]},"bbox":[-106.92857492393736,38.54435033981814,-106.92742507606263,38.54524966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107245208","area_id":"xtJdv5IlUNWpPDyhimXmSw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:46.449Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:51.995Z"}
