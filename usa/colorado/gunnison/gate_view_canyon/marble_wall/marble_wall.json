There are a few different sequences from the first to second bolt: either move straight up with long pulls on awesome crimps, or scooch a bit right and make tension moves to a good hold and traverse left on the horizontal. Climb to a shake then up to the roof though an amazing sequence of edges. Pull left through the roof using the \"black tongue\" to a good sidepull (the tongue looks like it could rip off, but it is really solid. I tried to kick it off when I bolted it, but it is there to stay and makes for a very unique hold). Contunue up on slopers to a kneebar just under the anchor. A horizontal hand-jam out left makes clipping the anchor a breeze. It may be the best route of the grade within a 30 minute radius of Gunnison.","protection":"7 bolts to anchors.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,933b93aa-def6-5be5-b363-1d4e2f419e6d,a741e3c4-a44e-53cd-b85f-cd6171faf201,6b2a2bae-0c03-5a4f-bcfe-6db38df5125e","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Gunnison","Gate View Canyon","Marble Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.928,38.5448]},"bbox":[-106.92857492393736,38.54435033981814,-106.92742507606263,38.54524966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107245185","area_id":"ayorrgwDWk+8/m2zjfUSXg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:46.448Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:51.515Z"}
