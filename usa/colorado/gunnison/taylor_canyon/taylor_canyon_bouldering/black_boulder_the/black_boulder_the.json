There are two left hand start hold options, but they don't change the move. Use what you want.\n\nGo straight up to a jug, and then go right and up to the lip. A couple fairly hard moves at the lip will traverse you to the right so you can mantel the lip on pretty good holds.\n\nMy preliminary thought is V10, but I would believe hard V9, maybe. The scare factor is hard to ignore.","protection":"The landing is quite bad. When you fall, you hit a very steep boulder then slide and hopefully run into the \"backstop\" instead of tumbling down the hill and off a small cliff. I'd recommend running two ropes down from the top of the boulder - one to suspend pads along the steep landing boulder and one to rope in a spotter.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,933b93aa-def6-5be5-b363-1d4e2f419e6d,fac948d7-629b-5e2a-82de-bd9078f25a68,9d95b000-30b2-50d8-b8de-af744a6483c7,5fe863f8-84a0-5fe6-8f8f-48635d89adbc","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Gunnison","Taylor Canyon","Taylor Canyon Bouldering","Black Boulder, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V10"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.74233,38.73274]},"bbox":[-106.74290643346193,38.73229033981814,-106.74175356653804,38.73318966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107582259","area_id":"X+hj+ISgX+aPj0hjXYmtvA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:48.208Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:35.170Z"}
