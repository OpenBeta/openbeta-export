The crack starts out on a lower angle crack to a steep, 3-4\" crack in the dihedral.  The crack slims down to hand jams at the roof. Pull the roof and enjoy the last few moves of crack to a ledge.  I set a bomber hex directional for my second and climbed up another 10 feet up an easy slab to some anchors to belay. Use those anchors to rappel.","protection":"A couple of smaller pieces (green and red Camalot size) and multiples in hand pieces.
