You can clearly see this line on Rosy Lane Wall from the sister route Angel Dust on PCP pinnacle. You can also easily scope the climb from the road or the Rosy Lane campground on the opposite side of the river from the crag. As you look at the main wall some of the most obvious features are the prominent straight up splitter crack that starts about 1/3rd of the way up and ends at the pronounced flake that juts out left at about the 2/3rds height. Where as Angel Dust is a very straight forward crack climb Mirror Crack is more diverse and engaging. I believe there are two cruxes on this climb. The first and 'physical' crux comes early. Turning the bulgy overhang on what was traditionally the 1st pitch. The second and 'mental' crux comes at the end of the splitter crack. Turning the flake that sounds like a gong. After that it is a moderate romp to the top. We always walked off the back side.","protection":"Gear is generally very good on this route. But, there may be a few spots where not having the proper sized gear (small down low, big up top) could cause distress.
