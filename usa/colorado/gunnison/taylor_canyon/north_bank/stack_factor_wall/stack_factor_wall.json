Stick clip the first and probably second bolt. It is steeply overhung and nearly sideways from start to finish. It has sustained hard climbing, but there are some good rests. There are often good holds, but the angle is very awkward. Your left arm will be dead after this one. It's like a 90 foot heel hooking bouldering nightmare....\n\nThe rock looks suspect in a few places, but I've never seen anything actually loose or break.\n\nBecause of the angle, there are some potentially extremely dangerous falls if you swing into the wall with a lot of rope out.
