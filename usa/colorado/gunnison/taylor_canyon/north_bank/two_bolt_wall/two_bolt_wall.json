Thoughtful climbing up bulges and through horizontal breaks offers a few sphincter seizure moments. Intriguing and sustained movement links features up the middle of the wall. If you are going to lead this fabulous face, be more than solid at the grade. You will regularly be doing stiff moves above the gear and falling will certainly mean hitting a ledge. Gear can be worked out from the horizontal cracks and seams that trace across the wall. Back in the nether years doing this route was a big deal. It was serious business without springy gear. Leading it meant you had arrived!\n\nRustie was a awesome climber and this was one of his minor, bold testpieces.","protection":"Small to medium gear and of all things two bolts.\n\nA two bolt anchor exists for belaying and rapping off.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"q/TnY9atXjyDrB+XdCesGg==","name":"Summertime","yds":"5.11c","grades":{"yds":"5.11c","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Joe Melley","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.76942,38.72652]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"117796084","mp_crag_id":"106421894","climb_id":"q/TnY9atXjyDrB+XdCesGg==","areaRef":"SENkz7xXXsCiH2KjnMt6lg=="},"content":{"description":"Summertime is a long, thin route with lots of good feet.","protection":"A bunch o' draws.","location":"It is 15' right of\n\nTwo Bolt\n\n."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,933b93aa-def6-5be5-b363-1d4e2f419e6d,fac948d7-629b-5e2a-82de-bd9078f25a68,0ffe357d-a4ba-51a4-af28-290ab4b8cdc3,484364cf-bc57-5ec0-a21f-62a39ccb7a96","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Gunnison","Taylor Canyon","North Bank","Two Bolt Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.76942,38.72652]},"bbox":[-106.76999638327709,38.726070339818136,-106.7688436167229,38.72696966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106421894","area_id":"SENkz7xXXsCiH2KjnMt6lg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:48.218Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:35.806Z"}
