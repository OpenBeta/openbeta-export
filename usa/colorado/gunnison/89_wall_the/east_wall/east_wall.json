The whole route is only about 100ft, but was broken up into 3 pitches to protect the second from heinous amounts of rockfall. In hindsight, 2 pitches would also be easily feasible. After a few more ascents in the name of cleaning and this climb will be awesome, but for now, be very careful.\n\nP1: Scramble up 4th class to a short chimney, then climb more 4th and easy 5th class to a ledge at the base of a short dihedral.\n\nP2: Climb the short dihedral to a ledge\n\nP3: Climb splitter cracks and flat crimps to the top of the detached pillar.
