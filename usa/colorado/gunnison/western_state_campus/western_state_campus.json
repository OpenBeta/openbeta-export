The main anchor point, is the beam that is closest to the door near the stairwell, use common sense and only actually weight this part of your anchor. It's best to belay from above. A number 5 cam actually fits bomber in between the vent and the brick wall, still don't weight it, haha. Also a number 1 nut/stopper is necessary for the anchor, because it's hilarious. DO NOT WEIGHT THIS PLACEMENT. Overall, if you equalize your anchor to just mainly using that beam, you're golden. P.S. a spotter is helpful to watch out for RAs.","location":"Go to the back door of Rubidoux, the one facing the fieldhouse.
