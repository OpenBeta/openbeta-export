Well, the deep, nasty gash to the right of the Painted Wall might be exactly what you're hoping for...or your worst nightmare. It is four stars, or a complete bomb depending on your point of view. Think of it as the \"Walk of Shame,\" aka the Cruise Gully, on steroids.\n\nI assume we did the first ascent, but a lost kayaker or a very sad Painted Wall climber may have been there before us.\n\nAlthough the gully looks like it's mostly a hike (hence the \"Tadpole\"), there's actually some \"Terrible\" passages with little bits of awkward, tricky climbing. The route has a distinctly alpine feel - lots of walking interspersed with technical steps, thorn bushes to simulate snow mushrooms, occasional icefall, and of course tons of loose rock. I think it's a shoe-in for Extreme Canyoneering Magazine's coveted drainage of the month.\n\nThere's some cool ice climbing potential high in the gully (on the backside of the Porcelain Arete), but this was melting out during our ascent in early March.","protection":"A single set of cams and a short rope will do.","location":"This is located just right of the Painted Wall's Northern Arete.

This is one of the longest climbs in the state, and should be climbed more.  The climb has three somewhat distinct sections, the lower-angled buttress pitches; the central chimney system; and the exit cracks and final arete. Expect a very long day of climbing with some minor routefinding issues, lots of simul-climbing, lots of wide cracks and chimneys, and passable-to-pretty good rock.\n\nNOTE: On the final part of the approach, contouring across the slopes below the Painted Wall will lead you to unpleasant dirt slopes that would be difficult to cross; better to stay closer to the river, then hike directly up the lower buttress to the start of the route.\n\nBegin at a white slab and corner about 200 feet above the river, in the large R-facing corner.  Climb the corner, then make a 5.8 traverse left to a belay at a couple of fixed pins.  Now climb 2 more pitches, up to 5.8, along crack/corner systems, to a large terrace below a smooth wall. Walk left 200 feet on the terrace. Now follow (simul-climb?) moderate grooves 400+ feet to a comfortable belay, then walk right through a chimney-gap to belay. Climb a nice 5.7 or 5.8 crack system, then work up a clean slab (simul-climb?) to the start of a steep chimney system that starts as a gaping slot. 5 belayed pitches and much simul-climbing.\n\nThe central and noticeably steeper climbing begins here. Climb the 5.9+ slot to a long chimney (5.8, little pro) in 2 pitches.  Now comes the crux, a 5.10 move getting into a wide crack at a bulge (fixed tube chock).  Above follow a long chimney, exit the chimney right at some blocks, to a belay right of the arete (routefinding issues). 5 belayed pitches.\n\nMove up and slightly left to steep finger and hand cracks going through two overhangs (5.10, a long pitch or two shorter ones). Move left onto broken terraces, then back right and up the arete, topping out in 3 more pitches.","protection":"1 set RPs, 1 set stoppers, cams 1 set TCUs to 3.5, extra 0.75 to 2, 4 medium-large hexes, optional 5 inch piece, and long slings.

The one-star rating is given for the fact that it is a free route that goes up the Painted Wall and makes for a pretty fun adventure -- so long as you don't mind yarding on loose blocks and chossing your way up prickerbush-filled corners for 2000 feet.\n\nThe route is mostly 5.8 and 5.9, interspersed with some easier scrambling and two back-to-back crux pitches midway up. While these cruxes go a little slow, the rest of the route can be climbed pretty fast, enabling an efficient team to blast the thing in an easy day if all goes well.\n\nComparing Journey Through Mirkwood to the\n\nSouthern Arete\n\n, I would say that the cruxes on Mirkwood are harder, but the route overall is not as sustained or enjoyable as the\n\nSouthern Arete\n\n. Therefore, I would say that this is a good route for someone who has done the\n\nSouthern Arete\n\nand wants to do another Painted Wall free route, but isn't psyched to step up to the runnouts on Stratosfear or the Serpent.\n\nThe route (reference p.86 of the guidebook):\n\nStart in the same corner system above the river as for\n\nSouthern Arete\n\n, Stratosfear, etc. and climb a few easy pitches to the large meadow 300 feet up the wall.\n\nWalk halfway across the meadow and look for a nice, slightly left-angling crack going up the slab. This is a fun, 200' pitch that ends on a large ledge. Walk down the ledge past fixed pins and bolts to its right side and set up a belay below a broken, right-leaning crack. The topo show two variations for pitch 5, but we just climbed up and right via the path of least resistance -- about 10a on good rock with ok pro. After about 40 feet, the climbing gets easier and lands you in another large meadow and a nice view of the large\n\nForest-Walker\n\ncorner system above. Here we untied, and 3rd classed up and left across the meadow.\n\nWe stayed unroped for the 5.7 chimney (pitch 6), which has a crux thrash through an enormous prickerbush, and the 5.6 pitch leading to the first 5.11 pitch.\n\nPitch 8. The topo shows this corner as being right-facing, but it actually faces to the left. At any rate, the feature is obvious from below. Climb up the corner, chossy 5.9 at first, and then crank into a 5.11 layback, and reach out right to the creaky \"chopper flake\" and mantle onto a pedestal and no-hands rest. Follow the line straight up through a flare and roof (10+) to a small ledge below the mighty \"Roofs of Mordor.\"\n\nPitch 9, the crux. Climb up to the roof. The aid line goes straight up past fixed gear, so step out right and crank up to too good jugs and jams until above the overhang, then sidestep back left to the main line and belay above the roof. This is an awesome feature that looks like 5.13 from below and was rated .12a on the FFA, but there are no moves on it harder than 11a/b (I'm not saying it isn't hard; it's VERY hard, but not .12a). There is a creaky block in the middle of the roof - take care while jamming past this thing.\n\nPitch 10. Now look up for the peg corner mentioned on the topo. Zigzag your way up to it (5.8/9 R) and belay at a good ledge next to the Hanoi Hilton bivy and a brand new 3/8\" bolt.\n\nFrom the bivy ledge, angle up and right to the enormous, left-facing corner system the leads past the \"Horseshoe Overhang\" and to the summit. We lost our place on the topo here, but if you stay in the large corner (5.8/9 with lots of bushes and chosswidths) and follow it until it spits you out left about 200' below the summit, you'll be fine.","protection":"One set of nuts and TCUs, two each cams up to 3.5\", one #4 Camalot; helmet and headlamp, 60 or 70m rope.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"f+YYkY/3Uc6jaSTsmJZzkA==","name":"Forrest-Walker","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Bill Forrest &  Chris Walker","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.70252,38.57939]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105758751","mp_crag_id":"105745310","climb_id":"f+YYkY/3Uc6jaSTsmJZzkA==","areaRef":"Jd73lwVXU82Y8uD92R5Tlw=="},"content":{"description":"With all the \" undeserved hype about the 'Stratosphere' Route everyone seems to have forgotten the \"original\" P.W. route.
