The first 350 feet of climbing follow primarily handcracks up good rock.  The rest of the climb (250 feet) is on not quite as good rock but nothing horrible.  It would be an alright introduction to climbing in the Black, as it is only 4 pitches (60m rope) and only 5.9 with good gear.  You top out on a spire overlooking the Chasm View Wall and The Checkerboard Wall.  Instead of traversing on the second pitch, we wanted to push the line through the big roof above, but the rock was very flaky and bad.\n\nDirections: head down Grizzly Creek Gully (next gully to the east of Cruise Gully) to the first rock band.  Make a 90 foot rappel.  Hike a little further till gully terminates into steep slabs. The climb starts above a large chockstone (20 feet?) just above the slabs.\n\nP1 (180 feet, 5.9). From the chockstone, climb a short handcrack to a ledge, follow lower of 2 ramps right until it is possible to gain the upper ramp, head back left to reach handcrack (watch for ropedrag). Follow handcrack to ledge above pegmatite band.\n\nP2 (175 feet, 5.9). Traverse right along crack for 40 feet to a ledge.  Follow crack system just above the ledge to a short, right-facing dihedral and to another big ledge.\n\nP3 (125 feet, 5.9). In the back of the corner is a pink colored, right facing dihedral.  Follow this and up left to gain a ledge.\n\nP4 (110 feet, 5.8). Climb steps and traverse left along ledges to reach the cliff top.\n\nDescend: hike toward canyon rim and back to camp.","protection":"Standard rack up to a #3 Camalot.  Double hand-sizes will be useful for longer pitches.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,933b93aa-def6-5be5-b363-1d4e2f419e6d,dc27c11e-06d3-52cb-bad8-b773996ce911,06e87339-a09f-5b18-a0a8-5803152c3314,f951c1ef-4a0b-5770-b56e-3f06155fa823","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Gunnison","Black Canyon of the Gunnison","North Rim Routes","Grizzly Creek Gully"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.70252,38.57939]},"bbox":[-107.70309520070411,38.57894033981813,-107.7019447992959,38.57983966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109540947","area_id":"+VHB70oLV3C1bj8GFV+oIw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:46.446Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:51.487Z"}
