At a point early in the route, I decided to follow what I saw as the reasonable line. I did the same again at the top when the topo ran out of topo 2 pitches from the top. The crux pitches were obvious. As I edit this 14 years after my ascent, I'm unsure it deserves to be called an independent route?\n\nAt 24 yearrs old, my views were different :)\n\nStart up the\n\nAir Voyage\n\n/diagonal ramp for two pitches, 400 feet, 5th class.\n\nP3. chimney as per Black Planet, short pitch.\n\nP4. Beak and hook left and slightly down until a solid TCU is reached.  Penji off this to an A1 corner, back clean, belay.  I believe Black Planet moves straight up off this belay (belay 3), I saw fixed heads above me.  The belay is shared.\n\nP5. Climb up 20 feet of sweet LAs to a point were the crack runs out. Hook left into free climbing. Belay on a ledge.\n\nP6.  Dance left, belay on a ledge. This is a natural bivi.\n\nP7. Climb a mega, 5.6ish flake.  Downclimb left side of flake, and run it out up to the big ledge.\n\nP7a. Move belay to right side of ledge.\n\nP8. Maybe it is new, maybe not, this is 5.8 R for sure and climbs directly to the leftward rail traverse on\n\nAir Voyage\n\n.\n\nP9. Black Planet pitch. There is bad rock requiring 5.10 climbing.\n\nP10. Black Planet pitch. Boulder off of the belay with no gear. Belay below desperate seam on ramp.\n\nP11. Black Planet pitch, Beyer A4+, thin heads in the long seam. I added one bolt 6' below what I believe to be Beyer's natural anchor, having missed it in darkness.\n\nP12 Black Planet pitch, my favorite on the route.  Heads in a seam end in a A2 grovel.  Belay behind large flake.\n\nP13. Black Planet 5.11 pitch.\n\nP14. Unclear where the Beyer route goes, Robbie Williams told me it connects into Air City roof here.  I moved straight right off of belay and negotiated the roof. BIG AIR!!! ending in OW groveling.\n\nBeyer's topo indicates you have topped out now, I found two more pitches.\n\nP15. Steep. mixed free and aid climbing culminates in a difficult guano mantle. Turn the roof into the horizontal bands. I drilled 2 rivets to breach a peg band.\n\nP16. Some free climbing, pulling on gear in a womb slot, and a nice hand crack deposit you on the rim.\n\n1 bolt was added at the belay 11, 2 rivets on P15 = total hole count.\n\nWhite devil on a black planet.","protection":"Standard aid rack, a set of hooks, 50 heads if none were fixed?\n\nOr perhaps it is V8 and some slabby 12-?","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"u2PjSRF1Wc2HvGwNEj26oQ==","name":"Walk of Shame","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"bouldering":true},"safety":"X","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.70883,38.582]},"left_right_index":33,"mp_id":"105761328","mp_crag_id":"105745058","climb_id":"u2PjSRF1Wc2HvGwNEj26oQ==","areaRef":"+7uRRElZXmagnCGspPzbBg=="},"content":{"description":"Having used the \"Walk of Shame\" to get back to the rim on my last three out of four trips to the Black, I feel like I'm well qualified to give the Beta.

I have heard this route described as \"Astroman's ugly cousin,\" \"harder than Astroman,\" and \"absolutely classic.\" I have no problem ignoring difficult route-finding, loose rock, lichen, munge, prickly cacti, and bird shit to call this route a total classic. It rules! For its position, sustained nature, and high volume of quality pitches, not to mention its size, this route lives up to classic status. However, I don't think it's as hard as Astroman, and don't come expecting it's flawless cracks.\n\nConsult the Williams topo and use this info as a supplement. Belays as marked on the topo are not always obvious on the route (e.g. no fixed slings or gear). Likewise, the topo pitch lengths are not proportionate and thus may lead to some confusion. My suggested pitch lengths are approximate and as close as I can remember.\n\nP1. Wide through a roof into a large, right-facing corner (150 feet). Link this into 2 with a 70m cord.\n\nP2. Climb a short pitch of .10- continuing up the corner.\n\nP3. Ascends a long, 5.7, choss gully around the corner to the right.\n\nP4. From the ledge at the top of the gully, climb up face holds and into the rightmost and hopefully cleanest corner above you. This is where the topo gets confusing as it shows climbing in an actual corner. If in doubt, just climb up, always being aware of the corners you're aiming for in about 3-4 pitches. I think trying to find the rock with the least lichen is handy as well. I never noticed bolts like the topo suggests. End at really old tat on a small stance/ledge(100ft?)\n\nP5. Head straight up the corner above 11b and place small aliens and RPs for gear as you traverse thin corners and ramps to the left. This bit is clean and fairly obvious. I linked this with 4 and belayed on top of the marked pillar on the topo, a very comfortable stop. Stay right in the corner above, don't wander too far out right like we did (160 feet?).\n\nP6. Climb up to a bulge, marked, and lieback and kneebar up it, then follow the bushy cracks above till the bolt can be spotted on the traverse out right (100 feet?) This can be linked easily with the next traverse.\n\nP7. The route is clean and obvious from here on out. Do a slabby/face traverse out right with a fixed nut and a crafty Alien or two for pro and climb up the thin crack to the bottom of the flare (60 feet).\n\nP8. This is not really an offwidth, more of just a flaring corner where straight up jamming and chimneying are used. The majority of it has a perfect hand crack in the back. The crux is at the top with interesting stemming moves to reach a bolt and belay out left on the arete. Don't be afraid of this pitch, in the valley it would be 5.9, and its well protected with smaller gear (100 feet).\n\nP9. This is the best pitch of the climb, the enduro corner. It is easier than it looks from below but packs a large pump. You get some great liebacking through #4, then #3.5 to #3 Camalots lead to a stem rest halfway up. Great liebacking or handjamming continue on and when the crack really begins to arch it gets much easier, finally ending in green Camalot size (120 feet) 5.11c.\n\nP10. Technical crux I suppose. Boulder problem with a bolt right off the belay leads to a long leftward traverse to a huge ledge (5.11c, 40 feet).\n\nP11. Off the upper tier of the ledge head up a pegmatite groove. The climbing is fun and challenging, and doesn't offer a ton of pro. The topo indicates a chimney of sorts and this is wrong. Its more of a groove that you face climb. Also, the bolt and belay are not really located on top of any sort of pillar. Where the topo says no! should be a huge 5 inch offwidth that doesn't look appealing to climb, but due to confusion I tried anyway. Don't do this, just belay at the bolt (120 feet).\n\nP12. The topo doesn't bother rating the face traverse that begins this pitch, but it is at least 5.11 slab/face and you would fall onto the shitty belay bolt. Based on the tat on the bolt, I think many people penji here and this may not be a bad idea. Continue up the cracks above which are really good (160 feet).\n\nP13. This is the womb fight. It is unrateable, horizontal offwidthing. Like Thank God Ledge's evil twin, this is no fun at all (100 feet).\n\nP14.

It ascends one of the steepest and biggest cliffs in the state, offering great jamming and devious, exciting face sequences. Factor in the adventure factor and sublime setting, and...you just have to climb it for yourself!\n\nThis is a detailed description replete with beta. If that bothers you, well, you know what to do....\n\n[Edit: the current guide came out after this description was written and the pitches don't track precisely.]\n\nTemperature-wise, spring and fall are the best times to do the route. May and September are probably the most common months. April and October may offer better temps, but also shorter days and less stable weather. November through March is reserved for hardpersons, June is dubious, and summer is strictly for sundogs.\n\nThe Scenic Cruise is actually a major 3 to 4-pitch variation to\n\nThe Cruise\n\n, a route of 12 or so pitches that ascends the 1700' SE face of North Chasm View Wall.\n\nThe Cruise\n\nwas first ascended by Layton Kor and Larry Dalke in 1964, and christened the South Face. In the mid-'70s, Earl Wiggins and Jim Dunn free-climbed the route in 6 hours, and consequently re-named it \"\n\nThe Cruise\n\n\". Three years later, Ed Webster and Joe Kaelin discovered the Scenic Cruise variation, thus avoiding a 5.10 offwidth pitch but adding spicy 5.10 face pitch. Amazingly, Wiggins then made the second ascent of the whole line with this variation-- in an hour and a half, free-solo!\n\nTo find the start of the route, descend the Cruise Gully. After the second rappel, continue following the base of the rock, down past the 4th class trough area that leads to the large unmistakable gash of Ament's chimney. Left of that, hundreds of feet up, lie the huge right-facing corner of Kachina Wings and the large left-facing corner of the Journey Home. Further left is the diagonal crack system of the Dylan Wall, and the more or less vertical cracks of the Cruise and Scenic Cruise.\n\nThe route begins a large, right-facing corner/groove, about 200 feet high, below the main crack systems. There is a flat rock and a bunch of poison ivy at or near the base. Above the corner is a low-angled, ledgy section; above that, the obvious diverging crack systems of\n\nThe Cruise\n\n(left) and Scenic Cruise.\n\nOnly a couple of the belays are fixed and there are a LOT of different ways to pitch it out. What follows is suggested for those who will be at or near their limit on this climb. 9 or 10 pitches is reasonable for a stronger team onsighting the route, and I've noted common pitch combinations.\n\nP1. Ascend the arete left of the corner, then step in and climb easily for a full ropelength to an uncomfortable belay.\n\nP2. Climb over a 5.8 roof and go up over broken grassy ground, past fixed slings to belay on the last ledge below a much steeper wall section. The Scenic Cruise splits from\n\nThe Cruise\n\nhere. We simul-climbed these pitches, as do a lot of parties.\n\nP3. Lead up and right over a 5.10- roof, and continue up the crack to a belay in a small inset. Or continue to belay on a ledge 50 feet higher...many do pitches \"3, 4, and 5\" as two long ones.\n\nP4. Exit the inset on the left and jam the continuous crack for 100 feet to a small stance with some fixed gear, fantastic 5.10-.\n\nP5. Jam the unrelenting but excellent hand and finger crack with many 5.10 sections, a harder version of the previous pitch. Considered the route crux by some. Belay in the pegmatite band.\n\nP6. This has the infamous Pegmatite Traverse, which rejoins the Cruise--a classic Black Canyon pitch. The easiest path moves up from the belay and then slightly left, avoiding the more prominent corner w/fixed pin directly above. Ascend a short 5.9+ crack in the pegmatite (3 friend helpful), then hand-traverse inobviously left on slopers, also 5.9. This achieves a stance on a down-slanting ramp. Reach back and sling a horn above the slopers: your best protection through the pitch's upcoming crux. An obvious flake/arete lies left of the ramp; climb that and continue up another crack to a fixed belay with slings around a block.\n\nA variation goes up into the corner/inset and traverses out and then down to the ramp at a fixed sling: reputedly harder, but easily aided with the sling. Either way, do not go all the way up to the top of the corner as this apparently leads to super sketchy shit.\n\nAlso, note that the Williams guidebook erroneously describes this as a rightward traverse, although the topo has it correct.\n\nP7. Traverse 15 feet left and ascend a 5.10+ corner with sustained stemming and liebacking, some dubious rock, but adequate gear (generally considered the route crux). Make an awkward traverse right under a roof, and then ascend a hand crack in another corner. Above this continue up two sections of wider 5.8 (or belay, if out of gear and/or gas).\n\nThe FFA apparently climbed a thin seam through pegmatite to the right of this.\n\nP8. The nice flat belay ledge has cracks leading up from either end, and both are climbable at about 5.8/9 with reasonable pro and quality (though the right has a nasty bush). Either way, above these continue up and left on easy ground and stretch the lead past a corner with several wedged blocks to a good ledge (or continue into the next pitch with a 70M rope, or brief simul-climbing).\n\nP9. Go left on the ledge and make an exposed move to get to an alcove behind a massive flake. Chimney up and right to a new bolt belay. Clever rope handling is necessary on this short pitch.\n\nP10. Follow a narrow, exposed ledge straight right, then angle up and right past three bolts with several insecure 5.9 moves. The last bolt is missing a hanger. Continue up and right through another pegmatite band to a nice belay ledge below a bulge leading into a groove. You can continue to the next ledge above the groove with a 60, although you'll face ledge-fall potential on the hard move into the groove.\n\nP11. Make an awkward 5.9+ move into the chimney, continue to a ledge, and head left for about 30 feet to the next crack system; belay where convenient.\n\nP12. Head up the crack/corner (with a fixed #3 Camalot) for a very long 5.9 pitch and arrange a belay. A variation which is often described as the standard line climbs gradually up and left from the ledge above the chimney on scary 5.9 face and flakes and rejoins the line.\n\nP13. Continue up the crack system, trending slightly right (5.8 or 5.9). Or, take an overhanging 5.9+ corner over to the left. Scramble to the top!\n\nThe Black has a reputation for loose rock which is as a whole is well-deserved, but this route is pretty solid throughout, especially on the lower crack pitches. However, this is probably the most traveled route in the Black, so start early and wear a helmet!\n\nP.S. the Peg Traverse has been oversold in some places as a death pitch. It's definitely spicy but not too hard or runout. It is not as dangerous as P1 of\n\nJourney Home\n\n, to compare to another Black trade route.","protection":"The amount of gear can vary depending how hard you climb and how much you intend to link pitches.

Stronger leaders will not need the #4, but it does come in handy in a few places (unfortunately most of them are on the crux pitch).

Clean cracks and flakes on the Movable Feast--the kind of pitches one would actually climb on a cragging day-- link into the exposed upper pitches of the Stoned Oven via moderate rockaneering in gullies midway up the route.\n\nLocating the start provided a few moments of uncertainty, although the information in the guidebook proved adequate and accurate as given. Once on route beta is sufficient; listed pitches are evidently long ones as even with a 70m cord we were unable to shave belay stances from the Movable Feast topo.  As the guidebook beta is basically accurate, I won't detract from your adventure by providing unnecessary minutiae.  I will add that on p.11 of the Stoned Oven we continued past the traverse move at the 1/4\" bolt to belay around the corner on a spectacularly exposed ledge, which au cheval stance gives great views of the leader stepping across to a nice hand crack free of the rope drag which would have begun the pitch had we belayed from the bolt.\n\nThence follows the Womb Fight, a pitch that you pray your sport climber friends never catch you 'climbing', as it embodies all of the distasteful qualities for which bolt-clippers shun the rack.  An awkward, graceless wriggle across a dirty ledge brings your face perilously near to ammonial slicks of ancient guano.  The rope, your gear, all you've brought with you conspires to impede horizonal progress, while you struggle to clip dubious gear crammed between crusty flakes and dirt.  Your partner isn't quite laughing, knowing that he must follow it with the pack.  Hopefully no one across the way on the South Rim has binoculars.

It was a CLIMBING magazine cover shot and received a fair bit of sensationalism in the Western Slope newspapers.  The first ascent was an outstanding achievement for the period and included some of the most impressive aid climbing yet done in Colorado. One can only wonder what was going through Bryan Becker's head as he hooked ad nauseum on the crux lead well into the danger zone. (Given the route name, it's easy to guess at least one thing going through his head.)\n\nToday it is THE wall route to do in the Black, and gets done a fair amount - although not in the Valley trade route sense. It is a beautiful line, taking a fairly direct route up one of the steepest and cleanest sections of rock in the canyon.  It has been climbed hammerless, rope-soloed many times, climbed in winter, and subjected to ruthless single-push timed efforts.\n\nEven after many ascents there is still a funk factor, although the route has no doubt cleaned up considerably since the first ascent. There are some potentially dangerous blocks and flakes on pitch 11.  Otherwise there is little munge, pegmatite or bad rock- a bit down low and some up high. Most ascents are now clean, but bring a hammer should a fixed head blow.\n\nSeveral \"chicken\" rivets have been added to the hooking pitches, and with the well-worn hook placements these blank pitches must be alot easier nowadays. One hooking strategy is to have a complete set of hooks on each of your aiders. This avoids fumbling as you find the right hook and try to remove it from the gear sling. You could also wear rock shoes and a chalk bag to use available face holds when high stepping. With all the hooking you end up doing, it's interesting to note that more than one climber has considered the crux of the route the final headwall rivet ladder, where one memorable rivet is bent down and almost completely out of its sleeve.\n\nOne of the most beautiful cactus colonies I have ever seen (anywhere) is directly on this route.  Please be careful crossing this clump of delicate plants and arrange your ropes to avoid it.  A mid- to late-May ascent may enable one of to see these in full bloom, a sufficently hallucinogenic experience in its own right.\n\nA motivated competent party could leave Boulder after work and bivy on the rim that night, descend at dawn and start climbing, bivy at Fantasy Island day one, Happy Trails day two, then top out (and drive home?) on day 3.\n\nDescend the Cruise Gully to beyond the toe of the Nose buttress and find a nice camp here amidst the poison ivy. There is a fire ring here but fires are technically illegal.  Bring iodine tablets and fill all your water bottles from the river.  Strategies vary, so depending on the hour, your motivation, and the general tao of the moment, fix pitches and camp here, or simply embark on your journey.\n\nP1-P5:  Locate the line with the most bushes. This leads to a large obvious left-facing corner system.  There are several anchors along the way on the initial pitches, so depending on your rope length consider stretching it out.  Haul on the right wall.  The hauling is hell early on, so the second should be available to unstick the bags.  The climbing gets better fast, and after a choss section of 5.10 (or C2), includes some nice 5.10 wide crack climbing (easily aided) and a beauty of a 5.9 hand crack (P5).  A poor bivy stance exists between the wide crack and hand crack pitches.\n\nP6:  Head left under a roof, then hook your way up the blank wall past several bolts to a roof with gear to lower off, and pendulum left into a right-facing corner leading to Fantasy Island.\n\nP7:  Climb a L-facing corner system to a belay on a flake (a quick, relatively easy lead).  If you arrive early at Fantasy Island it may behoove you to fix this pitch to get a jump on the next days climbing.\n\nP8:  A short stretch of sketch (most people will free climb this short section) leads to a beautiful L-facing dihedral.  The A3+ rating (a few fixed heads, some rattle-gear) is sometimes annotated with a \"5.11\" free climbing rating, but no way does this go as a 5.11 lead.  Belay at a cluster of bolts.\n\nP9-P10:  More hooking and the like lead up into a vast blank \"out-there\" section of wall.  Very enjoyable climbing, some bolts, some route-finding issues (issues, issues, issues), but pretty much every time you're in doubt a little Braille search above will locate a bomber hook placements.  These are the original crux pitches of the route.\n\nP11:  The cactus pitch, with perhaps a pin placement or 2, some loose blocks, and a traverse straight right at the top to reach Happy Trails bivy.  The start of this pitch is a bit spooky, runout on choss 5.9, but by now being spooked is feeling normal, so proceed with aplomb.  There is a bomber bolt to hang a ledge off at Happy Trails, great views below, an imposing wall above, and the ubiquitous but faint bivy odor of eau-de-climber.\n\nP12:  Head off right from the bivy, up some fixed heads to a traverse right (awkward gear placements), and the notorious headwall- a very steep, exposed section of memorable climbing graced with some pretty funky fixed stuff.  Belay at a cramped spot below a huge roof.\n\nP13:  Again, right and up from the belay, past an overhanging corner, some rivets, and a line of bolts.  This pitch eases off the higher you go, which is a nice feeling.\n\nP14:  Climb through some blocky pegmatite, up and left to some awkward and slightly strenuous stuff, and belay at a bulge (this is where the free version of the Diagonal meets the route).  Although pin placements are suggested for this pitch, with not much trickery it is easily climbed clean.\n\nP15-P16:  Enjoy the chossy 5.8 chimney munge above; you deserve it.  Find the line of least resistance from the terrace to the rim.  Fix the haul line, leave the haulbag (and your partner) hanging, and dash to the car for that cooler of beer.  Drink heartily, then return (with at least one cold one for your partner) to your final task of hauling the bag.","protection":"3 sets Friends to #3, doubles #3.5 and #4, a #4 Camalot, 2 sets TCUs, Wires/RPs, 2 sets assorted hooks including talons and Fish hooks, a small selection of heads (in case a fixed head blows on you) including a few circle heads , and a couple rivets hangers.

Climb up with no gear (5.10) to a good .5 TCU placement, then punch it further on runout 5.11 following a weird crack that eventually has good pro. Belay at 2 bolts (hanging). This is a difficult, heady lead and is very exposed.\n\nP10 (5.12b with 5.10c R). Climb up and right with RPs to protect 5.11d climbing. Now climb into the corner (you are now on the original Nose route) and do a difficult boulder problem past a fixed wire or two. Smaller fingers may help with this section- you may be able to just lie it back. This is very technical, powerful, 5.12b, and the technical crux of the route. Continue past a ramp and up a short step of 5.9 through some pegmatite. Belay on a sloping ledge (Pewter Ledge) at some bolts.\n\nP11 (5.10d with 5.10c R).  Climb unprotected 5.10c for 15 feet up a clean wall, then stretch right for a #0.75 Camalot placement. Move up and right past a bolt, then hand traverse right (5.10+) and up to a nice stance.

The climbing is unique, thoughtful, wildly exposed and just plain fun. As far as big wall free routes, this is one of the best in the country.\n\nThe \"R\" rating is totally dependent on the integrity of the fixed gear. On many of the pithes, your only protection is fixed copperheads, nuts, and pitons. The climbing is exciting, and large run-outs are to be expected. This route deserves respect.

There are several crux sections separated by good rests. Belay at a nice ledge with bolts.\n\nP8. An awkward 5.12 boulder problem protected by a bolt leads to maybe the most dangerous move on the route. Clip a copperhead that has been driven into a bolt hole, and do a tricky 5.12 move to a jug rail. If this heads rips, there are some ledges that you could hit. Continue up 5.11R corner, and traverse right to the belay ledge.\n\nP9. Awesome 5.12 climbing with fixed heads to a big roof traverse out right on jugs.

There are three very different crux sections on this pitch. All of the hardest moves are well-protected by bolts. The last 30 feet is the hardest and very condition dependent. If you catch this pitch while it's in the shade or on a cloudy day, it makes a HUGE difference. Belay at small stance on bolts, 5.13b/c.\n\nP12.

There's lots of good climbing, so it's worthy even if you A0 through the crux pitch, in which case the route is 12- A0.\n\nIt's a relatively short route, but it's nice to catch the crux in the shade, so an early start on warm days is recommended. It gets sun around 12:30 in the spring, likely earlier in the fall.\n\nTommy Caldwell did the second free ascent with me, a few months after I did the FFA. I don' think anyone else has free climbed it, but you never know. It deserves more attention.\n\nP1. There are three options: climb the wide crack on the right side of a pillar, 10+; climb the left-facing, slicer flake just right of the open book, 11; or stem up the open book, 10+ (my favorite option). Belay at some fixed gear on a nice stance below a small roof, 60 meters.\n\nP2. This is an awesome pitch. Climb easy rock to some techy stems. Avoid the chimney on the left, and transition into a left-facing flake then a right-facing corner above--super fun 5.10+. Belay at a small stance, 11+, 55 meters.\n\nP3. Another nice pitch. Head out onto the left wall of the book past a steep bit of wide crack, which eventually fades into a seam and some face moves. Stop at an uncomfortable hanging belay at some bolts, 55 meters, 11+.\n\nP4. The crux; a piece or two leads to into a steep, fading corner, and bolts through a black bulge--awesome, devious, crimpy climbing somewhere in the V8/9 range. (This pitch can be easily french freed at 12- A0.) Belay at a nice ledge, just 20 meters above.\n\nP5. Spicy face climbing past a few bolts eventually leads left into right-facing corner with a fixed nut. Belay atop a small pillar, 30 meters, 10+ R. This is the last truly cool pitch, but hey it's the Black, so 5 out of 7 makes it a classic!\n\nP6. This has tricky route finding. Head up the fading corner above, and then traverse straight left across two flakes to a large, right-facing feature. Climb up this corner to a pegmatite flake, now traverse right to a seam on a subtle arete, and find a belay stance just above, below a steep, right-facing flake that's a bit chossy looking. 35 meters, 5.10 with a bit of spice.\n\nP7. Pull the bulge/flake above, and meander to the top, 60 meters, 10-.\n\nFrom here, the easiest way off is to traverse across a bushy ledge and scramble to the rim via a 4th class chimney.","protection":"1 #00 TCU.\n\n2 each #0 TCU to #1 Camalot.\n\n1 each #2 to #4 Camalot.\n\n1 set RPs and wires.","location":"The route starts in a large open book to the left of the Plunge Pillar.

According to this: three hundred feet below the second Cruise Gully rappel, at the start of the traverse to Journey Home, begin the route at the second tree. It may be a little confusing to sniff out the start of the route.\n\nP1. Climb unprotected 5.8 to a right-facing corner with some 5.9, to a ledge. This is a long pitch.\n\nP2. Traverse up and right in an open book, then move up and left to a bolt.  Traverse straight left (5.10+) past 2 more bolts to a semi-hanging belay at 2 bolts (strangely, this anchor is just above a nice little stance). This is a patently dangerous pitch to follow; the second may want to practice the 5.10 moves still clipped into the first bolt, then unclip to follow - if you blow it you could swing a long ways and get hurt. Variation: Andy Donson climbed straight up from the belay (5.11c R or X) instead of doing the 5.10+ traverse, skipped the 2nd belay and joined the 3rd pitch.\n\nP3. Move a little left, then climb a continuous stretch of difficult face past 4 bolts through a bulge, and punch it to the belay. This is brilliant climbing, 5.12b. There is a small flake which you crank on that may snap on somebody.\n\nP4. This is the crux pitch. Climb a difficult (5.12a) right-facing corner with poor pro (RPs, TCUs) past a bolt, then follow the bolts through some of the best face climbing in the canyon, very spicy 5.12 b or c. The crux is a tenuous standup move on a tiny crystal, using a shallow, rounded crescent hold with your left hand and not much else. It is a long pitch ending at a nice ledge. This was bolted on the lead. Several very good climbers have backed down from this lead due to the fall potential from the crux.\n\nP5. Climb up, clip a bolt, then follow a corner to 2 more bolts protecting some 5.11- face moves. Perhaps it is a little runout. Belay over a small roof.\n\nP6. Move out and right with little gear, then go up (5.10+) to a belay below the obvious, overhanging corner capped by a massive roof.\n\nP7. Climb up and into the corner, then pull a hard move (5.11b or c). At the top of the corner, head straight left to an amazing belay on the arete (2 bolts). This is a wild pitch.\n\nP8. A mediocre pitch leads to the terrace.\n\nP9. (Optional) Climb a vague 5.11 hand crack to the only tree on the rim.  It is better to just walk left and solo off.\n\nI would recommend a stiff edging shoe for this climb.

The route is most notorious for a 60-foot-long section of offwidth on the 10th pitch that is rated 5.12-. All of the hard climbing on this route is, in fact, wide.\n\nOverall, the climbing is rather strenuous but nothing special for the first 7 pitches.  Then things change.  The next 5 pitches are interesting and/or hard.  There is no reason to bring anything larger than a #4 Camalot until the crux offwidth pitch, so leave these in the pack until then.  The follower (with the pack) will hate his/her lot in life for much of the climb.\n\nI was unable to actually free the crux offwidth when I recently did this climb with George Lowe.  I had led this pitch free with relative ease; however, in 1991 with Clean Dan Grandusky and then again in 1992 with Tom Dickey.  I'm interested in hearing how folks have fared on this thing.\n\nDescend the Cruise Gully, and hike down all of the way around the nose of the North Chasm View Wall and then around a buttress where the wall comes closest to the river.  You will then begin hiking up for a few hundred feet where you will see a bushy, right-leaning ramp on your right.  Ascend the 4th-class ramp for about 300 feet to its top.  You're at the right spot to rope up when you see a lot of orange-colored lichen on a face with a finger crack running through it.\n\nP1.  Traverse a bit right and then climb up some mixed face and crack to a good ledge about 130 feet above the start.  The crux (5.9+) is a hand crack towards the end of the pitch.\n\nP2.  Work up and left (5.8) for about 60 feet to a small ledge at the base of a right-facing dihedral.\n\nP3.  Climb a full-length pitch up the dihedral (strenuous 5.9) to its top.  The top is a large, boulder and cobble strewn ledge.  Two old, 1/4-inch bolts can be anchored to but camming anchors can be found to the climber's left of the bolts.\n\nP4.  Work up and a bit right on 4th-class terrain for about 60 feet to the base of a contorted crack.  Climb the crack (5.8) for about 60 feet to a good stance (save a #4 Camalot for the belay).\n\nP5.  Continue up the crack for about 35 feet then traverse straight left to gain access to an obvious right-facing corner system.  Continue up the corner for about 60 feet (5.10, wide) to a good ledge behind a flake.\n\nP6.  Continue up the corner (strenuous 5.9+, 3-4 inch) to a hanging belay.  There is enough rope to get to a decent ledge 45 feet higher, but, chances are, you've already used up any gear larger than a number one Camalot.\n\nP7.  Continue up the corner for 45 feet past a roof (5.10) to a good ledge.\n\nP8.  This is the best (and second-hardest) pitch on the climb.  Climb up the right-facing corner for about 60 feet (5.10 wide), then work left along a thin crack (5.11-) to a 3-4-inch crack near an arête.  Climb the strenuous crack past an offwidth section (5.11b/c) to a large ledge.\n\nP9.  Traverse straight left along the ledge (5.8), which thins and requires some balance moves in order to gain access to an even larger ledge directly below the obvious crux offwidth.\n\nP10. This is the defining pitch of Air Voyage.  The 60 feet of 6 - 8- inch wide crack is not all that scary-looking.  It's just vertical and is an obvious left-side-in offwidth.  When I did this in 1991 and 1992, there was a fixed tube chock about 20 feet up, and I remember just going for that tube chock and then running it out (maybe with one larger cam in between) until a #4 Camalot could be placed about 60 feet up.  More recently, armed with the biggest camming devices available (but with more weight, age, and less intestinal fortitude) I mostly aided the beast using a #6 Camalot (which will fit the entire way up), a #5 and #4.5 Camalot  (which fit here and there), and a couple of Big Bros.  It isn't pretty, but it really isn't all that hard to aid.  You can elect to finish this pitch all of the way up the now 4 - 5-inch-crack or make a hanging belay using #4 Camalots just above the offwidth section (wired nuts and/or a 1/2-1-inch cams will also fit here).  I've done it both ways, and, for this description, I have elected to break up the pitch into two.  The reason you might want to do the hanging belay is that you can use the #4.5 and #5 Camalots in the crack above.  By the way, the fixed tube chock is no longer there, nor are the fixed wires at the top of the offwidth (indicated in Derek Hersey's topo, attached)\n\nP11.  Follow the straight in 4 - 5-inch crack (5.10, strenuous) to its end and then traverse right under the roof (5.10) to a very exposed hanging belay.  The last part of the traverse is a stomach crawl.\n\nP12.  Climb a 3-4-inch crack for about 50 feet (5.10+) then move right under a roof (5.8).  This is the semi-famous Womb Fight section, so named because you crawl on your belly to gain the other side of the roof.  There is a large ledge that awaits you immediately after the belly crawl.\n\nP13.  Walk up the right-leaning ramp for about 40 feet and then ascend the broken face with cracks (5.9) to the top.","protection":"A standard rack along with 3 #4 Camalots, 3 #5 (or mixture of #4.5 and #5 Camalots), 1 (or 2) #6 Camalot, and 2 #3 Big Bros.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"+RRxvlnBWViX3p8zqCNgOg==","name":"Air Jordan","yds":"5.12+","grades":{"yds":"5.12+","french":"7c"},"fa":"Jonathan Schaffer and Andy Hughes, April 2014","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.70883,38.582]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"114323402","mp_crag_id":"105745058","climb_id":"+RRxvlnBWViX3p8zqCNgOg==","areaRef":"+7uRRElZXmagnCGspPzbBg=="},"content":{"description":"Consult Vic Zeilman's excellent guidebook for an accurate topo and route description.
