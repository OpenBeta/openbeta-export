It would be a great route to link up with something on the Newberry Slabs.  This would avoid the bushwhack approach that you must otherwise take.  The major redeeming qualities of the route are the crux pitch and its position in the canyon, which gives a great view of a number of other climbs, including everything on the east face of the North Chasm View Wall, from\n\nLeisure Climb\n\nall the way down to\n\nThe Cruise\n\n, as well as the\n\nCheckerboard Wall\n\n, and many of the routes on the South Rim.\n\nWhile approaching the tower (located directly above the Newberry Slabs), look for a right-slanting, wide crack on the left side of a prominent pegmatite band that splits the whole tower.  That is the routes second pitch.\n\nPitch 1. (5.9+). Climb the thin, left-leaning crack/seam, face climbing through sections, to reach a bulge above.  Traverse out left to a stance below an obvious, right-leaning splitter crack above.  This pitch is little dirty but not bad.\n\nPitch 2. (5.9). Head up the 5.8 hand crack.  It will get wide, but you can still get some smaller gear in to the right.  Pull onto a ledge (optional belay), and continue up 5.9 climbing to a larger ledge above.  This pitch is a lot of fun, and the rock quality is good.\n\nPitch 3. (5.11-). There are two parallel cracks heading out and left from the ledge.  This is the crux  a stellar hands and fists crack that climbs up and left through strenuous moves, which are well protected.  At the end of the crack, pull a bulge onto a stance.  From here, head straight up through some pegmatite, and traverse left on slabs to a good belay in a crack system (save a bigger piece for the belay if you can).\n\nPitch 4. (5.6). Continue on cracks and slabs to the top of the tower.\n\nOnce on top, walk to the far end (towards the\n\nCheckerboard Wall\n\n)  Here youll find a slung block (it may need some extra cordage).  Rap straight down into the chasm between the two buttress and swing to the other side, onto a ledge.  One 70 meter is fine, but one 60m would be cutting it really close.  Chances are if don't have a 70m, youll need a double rope rappel to get to the ledge.\n\nPitch 5. (5.7). From this ledge, climb up a chossy crack to the top of the other buttress.\n\nDescent: unrope and walk towards the\n\nCheckerboard Wall\n\n.  Take the gully behind it, and intersect\n\nThe Maiden Voyage\n\nwalkoff.","protection":"Standard double rack, (1 or 2) #4s.","location":"Descend the Cruise Gully and down the fixed raps.  From there, shoot for the prominent buttress above the Newberry Slabs.  Walk past the start of the\n\nCheckerboard Wall\n\nand bushwhack, heading downhill, towards a gully that leads you to the base of the tower.  The approach isn't too bad, but it might be more enjoyable to start something lower on the Newberry Slabs, and top out at the base of the Terbush Tower."},"__v":0},{"_id":"xwvRGAJAXx6MGF9g40jfAg==","name":"Newberry's Delight","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Jimmy Newberry and Less Choy, 1978","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.70252,38.57939]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107158586","mp_crag_id":"109540941","climb_id":"xwvRGAJAXx6MGF9g40jfAg==","areaRef":"TzXf2IbzUdqZuOiiQiTAlw=="},"content":{"description":"Newberry's Delight is located on the Newberry Slabs (that big chunk of nice looking granite located directly across from the east face of North Chasm Wall when you're descending the Cruise Gully).  There are many variations on these slabs.  It's unlikely that the description below is identical to the first ascent, but it does provide for some fun climbing up the center of the Newberry Slabs in roughly the area marked in Robbie Williams guidebook.  The original rating for this climb was 5.8; however, the first pitch seems to be harder than that.  This is a great route to link up with the\n\nPeter Terbush Tower\n\n, since it essentially tops out at the base.  If you're linking this route with\n\nMaiden Voyage\n\nor something else in the Cruise Gully, bushwhack from the topout towards the Checkerboard Wall and back into the gully.\n\nStart by walking up a veggy ramp to a ledge, located in the center of the Newberry Slabs (left-hand side when descending the Cruise Gully).  Look for an obvious, left-facing splitter just below where the slabs began to steepen.  This is the start of the first pitch.\n\nP1 (5.9). Climb the splitter crack through layback moves, hands and wideness to a chimney slot stacked with chockstones (they're rattly but fairly solid). When the chimney terminates in a roof, with a steep looking OW above, traverse left to a ledge.  This is a great pitch.\n\nP2 (5.9 or 5.6). Move up and left through steeper, broken terrain ending on a ledge covered in blocks and bushes.  Move right and locate a short, left-leaning finger crack in the steep slab above (somewhat hard to spot)  Climb to the finger crack and continue to a large terrace above.  Move right off the edge of the terrace on 5.6 slabs to a stance below an obvious, left-leaning hand crack.\n\nNote:\n\nIt's easier to follow a ramp up and right from the end of pitch 1, bringing you to a large ledge and a chimney that leads up to the terrace above (5.6ish) Follow the slabs from the terrace to the same belay stance at the end of pitch 2.\n\nP3 (5.8). Climb the left-leaning hand crack to slabs above.  Trend up and left until you spot a traverse leading to a large ledge on your left side.  From this ledge, climb a hand crack to where you can safely unrope and walk off.  It may be necessary to split this pitch up if you have a 60m.","protection":"Standard rack, (1 or 2) #4s for the first pitch.","location":"Descend the Cruise Gully.
