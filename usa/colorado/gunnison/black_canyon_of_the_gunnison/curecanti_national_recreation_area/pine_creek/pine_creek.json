Old school is the best way to describe this route. It's not a cam route, put them aside save one or two and grab those sick small nuts we all hate. The route starts off in a fingertip crack and works its way up about 40 feet to a roof. This is where things get fun! Your last placement is over ten feet below the roof, and there is no gear until well after you pull the roof. Once you pull the roof, you have over 50 more feet of face climbing with very little pro before the top out.\n\nI learned more about placing pro by following Jimmy on this route than any time in my 18 years of climbing.\n\nThe moves are all there and not that hard but the fear of gear sure is.","protection":"Take a rack on nuts and make sure you have small sizes for the top. Two or three small cams are good on the bottom half of the climb. You can walk off the route to the left (north) of the climb down a gully or sling a boulder at the top to rap.","location":"The route is on the right hand side of the road as you are driving into the crag. It is just a cross the creek and up a small bank. It starts in a small corner that works its way to a roof. It is easy to pick out form the road and is the only climb of its type there."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,933b93aa-def6-5be5-b363-1d4e2f419e6d,dc27c11e-06d3-52cb-bad8-b773996ce911,b1c0601d-c488-5b19-8a5c-b1d69861102c,402afcac-4637-565a-9867-e7781f918070","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Gunnison","Black Canyon of the Gunnison","Curecanti National Recreation Area","Pine Creek"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.48004,38.44252]},"bbox":[-107.48061410833779,38.442070339818144,-107.47946589166222,38.442969660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105882784","area_id":"QCr8rEY3VlqYZ+d4H5GAcA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.48061410833779,38.442070339818144],[-107.47946589166222,38.442070339818144],[-107.47946589166222,38.442969660181866],[-107.48061410833779,38.442969660181866],[-107.48061410833779,38.442070339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:46.444Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:25.600Z"}
