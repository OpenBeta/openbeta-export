From this climb's anchor, you can also rappel down and to the left to find the anchor for the 5.10 top rope.\n\nThe adventurous have made this climb into two pitches either by going far right and up towards/over the big block, by staying straight and going up onto the slabby dihedral, or by veering left and going through roof-ish steep crack.  In any case, this is trad climbing and the rock can be loose - especially look out for lots of loose junk on the slabs on top.","protection":"6 bolts + slings on anchor.\n\nBringing something for your belayer to lean back on can be nice - the climb starts up on a smallish ledge.
