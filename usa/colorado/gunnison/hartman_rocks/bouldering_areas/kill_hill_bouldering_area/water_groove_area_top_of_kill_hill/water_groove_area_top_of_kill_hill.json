After parking look to the south and you will see the boulders that you past on the way in.  The first obvious boulder right ahead contains two known routes starting as a sit start with a sloping rail rising right to left.  \"Grin and Bear It\" starts at the rail in the dirt and goes left. Pull the rail until it ends then go big around the corner to the jug.  Make a finese move to the crimp in the black face, left to vertical jug.  Pull the move to the sloping lip and the hidden crimp top out.  This is the first problem I can put my name on, I gave the best estimate of a rating so enjoy and let me know what you think.","protection":"Kind of a messy landing with a slab sloping into the climb located right under the fall.
