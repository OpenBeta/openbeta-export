It involves a low angle start, a bolted overhanging crux, and finally a beautiful, exposed headwall to the top.\n\nP1. 5.11a. Climb up and right on low angle terrain with spacey gear. Gear improves as the terrain gets steeper, and eventually you get to a short, overhanging section followed by a fun, technical crux protected by 4 bolts. Finish on an obvious ledge with a two bolt anchor (150 feet).\n\nP2. 5.11a. Climb beautiful cracks as they trend up and right to the ridge. Hands, fists, crimps, and technical footwork make for a sustained and engaging pitch on a beautiful face way off the deck.
