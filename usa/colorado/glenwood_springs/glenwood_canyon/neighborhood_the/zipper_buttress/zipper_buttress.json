The climb features sustained climbing, fun sequences, and great rock throughout.\n\nStart by climbing up an initial easy section protected by one bolt before a wide horizontal break/crack that runs across the wall. Just above, is the second bolt in a gray rock bulge. Climb above this bolt into a sustained set of moves that take you past the next four bolts with the crux coming at the sixth bolt. Easier climbing leads to the top and the anchor. The middle section of this route can prove perplexing and even frustrating because many, or most, of the holds that look like jugs from below turn out to be horrible slopers. Instead, make great use of a series of sidepulls and pinches while constantly moving your feet around to make the best use of them.
