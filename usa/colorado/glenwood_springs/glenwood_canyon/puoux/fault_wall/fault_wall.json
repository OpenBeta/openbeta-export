I would not be shocked to hear it called 13d/14? It looks that impressive. This wall is close to 45 degrees overhanging, is composed of immaculate limestone, and is just as colorful as it shows here. I know an awfull lot of terrific climbers who could tick this line, and just from the look of it, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend route 36 as a killer project. The hike from the car takes 10 minutes, the base was dry on 20 Jan.
