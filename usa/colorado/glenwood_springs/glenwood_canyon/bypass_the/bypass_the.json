Moving just left of the second bolt latch a nice left sidepull and a good edge before clipping the third bolt. Get set up and move hard right to a good, slanting sidepull. Move to a match on slopey, uneasy holds and clip the fourth bolt if you can. Or, better yet, make one more move to a small, incut hold out left and clip the fourth bolt. Then, make a big move to a horizontal seam where you can try to shake out before clipping a fixed stopper and cranking out the final moves with the use of a finger jam and some nice holds on the face.
