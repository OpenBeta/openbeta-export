The second pitch goes up cracks then right by some big blocks... tred lightly. Head toward a tree then up a peg band. Trend left on okay rock to a ledge with a bolt/piton anchor. Untie and walk left to the far side slab/arete. Climb relatively unprotected rock up to the arete stay true to the arete, and pull up to a slab finish. Most of the pro on this pitch was used to avoid the rope dislodging any block not to hold a fall. Untie and walk around the quartzite finish and find an easy way to the top.\n\nRap two 70m ropes from the top tree back to the bolt and piton anchor then all the way to the ground. There are also tons of rap options from trees.","protection":"Glenwood canyon rack, single rack o cams, nuts, and pins.","location":"See the photo."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e47011e8-0189-55d7-bf00-665ce3c108f4,fd4cfe65-eea3-59b9-9a7b-8401d6c7fbe5,fbc0f284-1f50-50aa-822a-c8368f71e0fb","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Glenwood Springs","Glenwood Canyon","Hanging Lake Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.22249,39.57474]},"bbox":[-107.22307337256326,39.57429033981814,-107.22190662743674,39.57518966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108215783","area_id":"+8DyhB9QUKqCKsg2j3Hg+w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.22307337256326,39.57429033981814],[-107.22190662743674,39.57429033981814],[-107.22190662743674,39.57518966018186],[-107.22307337256326,39.57518966018186],[-107.22307337256326,39.57429033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:01.287Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:14.383Z"}
