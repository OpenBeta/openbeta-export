Climb the left side of the face using thin face holds and a variety of holds on the arete ranging from good, incut holds to difficult slopers. The technical crux probably comes around the 3rd bolt but throughout this short climb you'll be challenged with the body tension, balance, strength and foot work required.\n\nThe name stems from my experience on the first ascent. I had cleaned and bolted this \"mini\" project last fall when my time during the week was limited and it was a perfect way to get out and climb close to home. This year, my wife and I are expecting our first child so my major goal for this year is to prove you can be a dad and still \"be bitchin'\". I first led the route on my birthday so it seemed fitting to call it How To Be Bitchin'. Don't worry I don't take myself that seriously and I recognize that few will care about a short little route next to the interstate. But, if you want/need a quick pump then this might be the thing for you.","protection":"Four bolts to anchor.","location":"On the left side of the west face of The Diamond is this steep, slightly overhanging arete."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e47011e8-0189-55d7-bf00-665ce3c108f4,fd4cfe65-eea3-59b9-9a7b-8401d6c7fbe5,fcfd1299-ca53-559b-b4f6-ebc5304b2aa5,cb4bbf2a-24b5-55d8-a083-28a1b58c1d22","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Glenwood Springs","Glenwood Canyon","Airy Block, The","Diamond, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.21427,39.57692]},"bbox":[-107.21485339091015,39.57647033981814,-107.21368660908985,39.57736966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106386074","area_id":"y0u/KiS1VdiggyihtYwdIg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:02.009Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:52.915Z"}
