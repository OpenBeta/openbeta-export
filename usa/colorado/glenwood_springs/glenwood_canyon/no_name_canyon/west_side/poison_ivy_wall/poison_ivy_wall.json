I used the pitch described here to bone up on my solo-aid skills before embarking on my first solo big wall in October 2017.\n\nWhile only C2 (or A1 if you hammer a Lost Arrow or knifeblade piton or two), the crux moves all have ledgefall potential, hence the R rating. This little line has it all—steep, reachy moves on thin gear, including hand-placed beaks, and also a committing mantel off of a hook. Be careful where the upper crack becomes rotten and crumbly. If you can lead this lichenous, funky and intimidating pitch with confidence, you will probably enjoy the more straightforward aid pitches that can be found in classic areas like Zion and Yosemite.\n\nStart on the steep, fractured rock to the right of the steel doors. A fat, old eyebolt and some bore holes (tricams work well) make for a convenient anchor if solo aiding. Move left into the overhanging seam above the doors. A shallow slot that accepts a small cam is the goal and is key for protecting the moves above. Follow the thin crack to the sloping ledge that bisects the wall (a large grappling hook is very helpful for gaining the ledge). If you've had enough, you can escape right along the ledge to a 5.8 corner and the anchors at its top; these anchors are the destination either way. Otherwise, continue up the thin crack that parallels the left side of an arete. This crack is covered in lichen and has a section that's very friable before you reach the security of good gear near the top.\n\nAt the top of the headwall, it's worth setting a directional anchor (finger- to hand-size cams) before traversing to the bolted anchor off the right end of the big ledge.","protection":"Stoppers, micronuts, a beak or two, cams from the smallest size to 4\", with doubles of the micro and finger sizes.
