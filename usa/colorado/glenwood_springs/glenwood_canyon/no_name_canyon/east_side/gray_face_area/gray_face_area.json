After the crux move (the start is maybe a wee bit harder than 5.8), jam and lieback the ever-widening crack.  Following the crack up and to the right on a ledge brings you the anchors of the\n\nJungle Book\n\n.  Two variations exist on the top.  1st variation: (5.10) Follow the right arching crack up until it is possible to move left with face moves into a small finger crack.  A few sweet ring locks bring you to anchors on which you may top rope the slab.  2nd variation: (5.10) Top the crack out to the ledge with the\n\nJungle Book\n\nanchors.  Continue up an additional twenty feet in the sweet hand to fist crack; top out on the diving board, walk back ten feet, and rap off of black Metolius anchors.\n\nThe slab to the left of the climb is often top roped by the anchors of the first variation. There exists a number of good face moves on edges (5.9). The anchors may be reached by some fifth class scrambling around the corner to the left, near the start of the pink face.","protection":"Standard granite rack.","location":"Per\n\nJeremy Joseph\n\n: it is located on the CMC Wall.
