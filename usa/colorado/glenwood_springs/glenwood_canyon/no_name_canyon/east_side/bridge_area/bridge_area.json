At that point, though, it's possible to clip or grab the chains, which are hanging in your face. And if you climbed through the first crux, you'll likely be fine there anyway.\n\nThe clipping positions are all reasonable, though the crux clip might be hard to find onsight.\n\nHere's some beta for pulling the rope and keeping it out of the water: pull it from the opposite side of the creek and give it a good snap just before the end drops from the chains. Make sure people aren't walking up behind you as you do this, or they might get an unwanted lesson in BDSM.","protection":"In addition to quickdraws, bring finger-sized cams and stoppers from a #0 Metolious TCU to 1 inch. A #3 Camalot isn't necessary but provides some confidence for a hard move. Save the purple Metolius and a long runner for after the crux.","location":"This route climbs the obvious arete that rises straight out of the creek 60 feet left (upstream) of \"\n\nElectric Butterfly\n\n.\" When the creek is running low, it's easily crossed to the base of the climb.
