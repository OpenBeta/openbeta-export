The hardest moves are over by the second bolt but moves keep coming until you pull into a scoop about halfway up the route and enjoy a no-hands rest.  After recovering, do two more semi-hard boulder problems separated by a rest and tiptoe to the anchor on questionable rock.\n\nShort and Demanding has 4 star movement, but 2 star rock.  If you don't mind a little silt, and crumbly rock, you will probably like this thing.","protection":"Bolts and two anchors with fixed carabiners.","location":"Starts out the left side of a small, gray scoop in the middle of the Super Pouox wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e47011e8-0189-55d7-bf00-665ce3c108f4,fd4cfe65-eea3-59b9-9a7b-8401d6c7fbe5,a8e1f3c0-b73b-537b-b29a-b58515cf3d60","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Glenwood Springs","Glenwood Canyon","Super Puoux"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.3037,39.566]},"bbox":[-107.30428329902756,39.56555033981814,-107.30311670097247,39.56644966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106384084","area_id":"qOHzwLc7U3uymrWFFc89YA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:01.281Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:51.441Z"}
