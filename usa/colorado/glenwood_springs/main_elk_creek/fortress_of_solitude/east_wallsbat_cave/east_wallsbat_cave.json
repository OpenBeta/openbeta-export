As you round the bend past the second big pillar, you'll head steeply uphill on a slidey scree slope into an alcove with four routes. This is the leftmost route.\n\nYup, yup, I know, there's a much more famous (and probably much better) Orange Mechanique in Cimai, France (8a), but I couldn't come up with a better name.\n\nThe bolts are a little more closely spaced on this one than most Fortress routes due to the stucco-like texture of the rock, which could tear your knees up and elbows up pretty good in a fall. The holds themselves, however, aren't too sharp. This sort of climbs like a Shelf Road route.\n\nTreating the crumbly pockets gently, stretch high for the first bolt, clip a second, then move slightly up and left to the third. Turn a small roof, then onto the orange face, which grows increasingly harder and more technical the higher you get. (It begins to overhang just a bit, too.)\n\nA decent pocket near the arete gives you a shake before the redpoint (pump) crux moving into the grey rock. Climbing on water pockets and grey incuts takes you to the anchors, at the base of a dihedral.\n\nBest done on cool-weather days and with a good, stiff pair of shoes.

Through the scoop, beware of the loose-looking rock off to the right, which is ... loose.\n\nThough it's a bit runout to the cold-shut anchors (shared in common with the 11c to the right), I didn't want to add another bolt and infringe on that line. The climbing is 5.8 or so if you pick the path of least resistance above the last bolt, heading straight up, then diagonalling right on big incuts.
