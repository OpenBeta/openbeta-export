First bolted by George Squibb in the early '90s, Vogue was finally freed by Tommy Caldwell in 1999 and is considered to be one of the hardest and most classic sport-climbs on the Front Range. Despite its classic status, Vogue has seen relatively few ascents in the 12 years since it was first freed, owing in part to the long approach, short season, and difficult conditions. Vogue climbs the striking refrigerator feature that soars out of the left side of The Industrial Wall cave to the top of the wall. The climbing on Vogue is characterized by powerful compression moves up the refrigerator feature that increase in difficulty up the route. The crux is contained in the final three bolts, involving extremely technical kneebars and core sapping slaps up the refrigerator. This sections is capped by a large deadpoint to one of the only positive crimps on the route. Many climbers have fallen repeatedly on this final move, and it is the redpoint crux. Core tension endurance is the key to success for this pitch.","protection":"Bolts and right kneepad.
