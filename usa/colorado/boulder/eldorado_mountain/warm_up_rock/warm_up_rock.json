Find a stable position and clip the 1st bolt.  Move up and right to a good rail and clip. Now it gets a bit awkward as you try to move left and get stable.  A cam be placed in the crack to the left. You can find a cool thread.  Reach far right and clip.  Move up to an alcove with an old nest, and milk the rest.  Clip, move up and left, and run it to the anchors on somewhat licheny holds.\n\nNote, the guidebook lists this as a 10b, but you might get a surprise if you go into it thinking it's \"only a 10.\"\n\nA stick clip is recommended.","protection":"4 bolts, an optional #3 or #3.5 Camalot, a 48\" sling for a thread, 2 bolt anchor with chains.\n\nA stick clip is recommended.","location":"This is the left of the bolted routes."},"__v":0},{"_id":"HIag9YPZXmm5K7cDxXxVGg==","name":"Sport Hiker","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28238,39.92003]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108599979","mp_crag_id":"108599960","climb_id":"HIag9YPZXmm5K7cDxXxVGg==","areaRef":"YnXmY5UqWq+RaY/ofy27yw=="},"content":{"description":"This is a good, overhanging sport route on generous holds that packs a bit of a punch.
