The way I've seen it done is getting a somewhat high left hand edge that's not too bad, but certainly not positive, and pulling up utilizing a shallow pocket for the right to a lockoff and reach with the right real high on the bulge/face.  From here the problem follows better holds once you find 'em to the top.\n\nI myself have not yet done this problem, so my assessment of the difficulty is only secondhand.

This is one of the more prominent problems at Flag due to its visibility and proximity to the upper parking area.

From here two super-thin edges guard the crux moves to the lip.\n\nI have seen the problem graded in various guides anywhere from v5 to v7.  The discrepancy is probably due to the fact that a key hold apparently broke in the last few years making it harder.  I can't even get off the ground on other v7s at Flag, so I highly doubt it's that hard.  Still, I found it more difficult than Flag v5s like Hagans, Eric Varney, Face Out, and Polling Pebble, so I'm tempted to believe its probably v6.
