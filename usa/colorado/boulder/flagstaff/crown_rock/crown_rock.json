The most common line is up the middle trough to a big ledge at 40 feet. Either continue left up a short corner or step right to a smooth slab crux and finish.\n\nSolid rock and a variety of holds make this an excellent introduction to climbing. Climb in the morning for sun or afternoon for shade.","protection":"Either solo it or use a TR. You must build your own anchor.
