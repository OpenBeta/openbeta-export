For someone like Peter Beal who is shorter, it's probably more like V12-13 because he has to use the worst hold on the wall.\n\nNevertheless, it's a great addition to the Schwagstaff circuit regardless of how you climb it.","protection":"2 small pads.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"TtE+ny2DUlm+vCsgoYlVtQ==","name":"Smith Overhang","yds":"V8","grades":{"yds":"V8","font":"7B","vscale":"V8"},"fa":"Richard Smith, 1967 (but surely not the V8 version?
