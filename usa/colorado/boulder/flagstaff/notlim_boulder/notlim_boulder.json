It is a beautiful, obvious and slightly overhanging line away from the masses. Climbers from all over the world come park at Capstan Rock, slip down into the woods and quietly enjoy one of the best lines Flag has to offer.  Although the name might suggest it was a Holloway problem, Rob Candelaria got the FA after - if my memory serves me correct - Jim showed it to him.\n\nHollow's Way ascends the obvious yet very thin overhanging seam on the north face of the Notlim Boulder. Move up the useful holds in the seam (they are obvious) and, depending on your footwork and finger strength, go for the lip and pull over.\n\nThere are a number of ankle twisting/breaking roots at the base of this boulder, so it would be wise to use at least a couple large pads while you are working on it. There is a single bolt-anchor on top if you want to try it on TR - but with a couple good pads and a spotter - you should be more than fine.\n\nEnjoy.","protection":"Crashpads and a spotter.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,8071adfd-baa5-506e-9150-589f9e9bb0ae,ac668c85-c9ec-5001-801c-fcdae2543721","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flagstaff","Notlim Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29561,40.00323]},"bbox":[-105.29619701744807,40.00278033981814,-105.29502298255197,40.00367966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746602","area_id":"rGaMhcnsUAGAHPza4lQ3IQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.29619701744807,40.00278033981814],[-105.29502298255197,40.00278033981814],[-105.29502298255197,40.00367966018186],[-105.29619701744807,40.00367966018186],[-105.29619701744807,40.00278033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:59.660Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:23.484Z"}
