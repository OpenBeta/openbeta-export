This would be a 3 star, in my opinion, but the rock quality is not that great. However, the problem is a few really fun moves on small holds and then tops out on a jug. Start low with your feet on a huge rail and your hands on some crimps and then move up to a little crimp rail/flake and then up to the lip.","protection":"A pad.","location":"This is on the Hoh Overhang, which is right on top of the\n\nSlot Overhang\n\n.
