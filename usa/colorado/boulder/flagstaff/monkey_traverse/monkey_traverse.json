This pumpy and technical traverse is highly recommended and worth the effort required to beg, borrow or steal the requisite beta.

The first section is juggy and overhanging. The second section climbs through a bizarre sequence on brilliant holds to a no hands kneebar rest. The last section requires tricky balance and tops out the far left hand side.
