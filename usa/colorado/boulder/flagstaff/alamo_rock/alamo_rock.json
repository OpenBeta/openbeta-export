That said, it is an enjoyable place for the newer climber to safely attempt a short section of offwidth (on TR of course). The first 40 feet involves an easy climb up a mild slope before reaching the beginning of the overhanging crack. One must combine several offwidth jams with face jugs to surmount the final crux section before reaching the anchors.","protection":"There are two bolts (maybe still the '50s eyebolts?), but both are showing signs of corrosion around the washers. It would be prudent to reinforce these with hand-sized gear in the crack to the climber's left of the bolts. The anchor station is accessed by a 4th class scramble around the right side of the Alamo followed by one or two 5th class moves to gain the summit, be careful on the downclimb when you're done.","location":"Park at the pullout for Crown Rock and walk on the main trail South. Look to your left (east) for a divergent trail after passing Crown Rock and before Pratt's Overhang. Follow this trail SE for another 50-60 yards (?), and the Alamo will come into view."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,8071adfd-baa5-506e-9150-589f9e9bb0ae,39e1be1c-332c-5a15-8526-d31ed015ac66","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flagstaff","Alamo Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29543,39.99998]},"bbox":[-105.2960169895072,39.999530339818136,-105.29484301049281,40.000429660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746524","area_id":"OeG+HDMsWhWFJtMe0BWsZg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:59.667Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:45.438Z"}
