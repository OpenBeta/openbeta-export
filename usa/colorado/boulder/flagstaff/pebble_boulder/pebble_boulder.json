One can identify it by a seam with two handholds that angles down and left; these are your starting handholds. To start, put your hands on the handholds and get your feet up; however, you like it-some use a heel hook, other just use a toe under the 'hang. From here, blast up to the sloping ledge above, and then grunt your way up and over the bulge, mantel-ing as you go, utilizing if need be the next sloping ledge above. I personally like to put my left foot on the starting handholds and then rock onto it for the mantel.\n\nThis is a classic scrape your legs and stomach problem and a must do for Flagstaff firsters.\n\nI give it two stars, because no one else will, and because it's such a battle.","protection":"There's a big root and ledge below this problem, and you have to hang upside down almost to start it, so it can hurt to fall unless you position your pad appropriately.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Qi2j+HNPW5CPQO2iO+cvbg==","name":"North Overhang","yds":"V3-4","grades":{"yds":"V3-4","font":"6A+","vscale":"V3-4"},"fa":"Pat Ament, 1967","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29701,40.00262]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106214976","mp_crag_id":"105746492","climb_id":"Qi2j+HNPW5CPQO2iO+cvbg==","areaRef":"CnwurWATU/uzzRmzaU1P7A=="},"content":{"description":"Climb on the north side of the Pebble Wall boulder.
