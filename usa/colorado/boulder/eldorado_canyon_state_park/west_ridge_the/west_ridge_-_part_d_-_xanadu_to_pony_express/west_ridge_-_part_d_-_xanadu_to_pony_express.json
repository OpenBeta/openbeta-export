The pitch is rated 5.8, but it feels pretty easy at the grade. Rests and stems are abundant, as well as positive holds to hang on while placing gear. The climbing was fun, airy, and being high on the West Ridge provides great views.  As with all Eldo climbs, check that the rock is stable before yarding on it.  Overall, a nice pitch for the grade.  Not incredibly classic but a great, well-protected route if you are working up through the grades.\n\nFrom P1, there are two descent options.  One is to look to your left after you reach the first ledge with a small bush.  There is a tree with rap slings just to your left.  A 60m rope will get you to the ground.

Working Class Hero climbs the easiest line up about 70 feet of jumbled low angle rock to the next buttress just up and right from the belay trees.\n\nP3, Per\n\nTony B\n\n: Above the previous pitch above a horizontal rotten band lies a broad stack of huge, vertical flakes, about 50-60 feet tall and more than twice as wide.

This pitch climbs the final crack and dihedral system, with a few pods that slow down the leader a bit despite its easy grade this climb is P3 (5.8).

It uses crack and dihedral technique to reach the top of the Upper Construction Zone buttress.\n\nTo descend from pitch 3:  From the top of the vertical rock, you scramble up and left (W/NW) to a large pine tree, at which there is a solid fixed rap station.

Perform a tricky mantle (10-) protected by a couple of RPs onto the smaller ledge.  Once standing on the 2nd ledge, reach high and place a #2 RP; ensure the solidity of this piece as it is probably all you will get through the crux -- if it blows, you will probably hit the tree ledge.  The crux is the 10' after the small ledge.  The left wall is vertical, has no footholds and a few disappointing handholds.  The right wall is slabby, has a few foot nubbins and no handholds.  There is at least one decent protection opportunity for a small RP in the crux, but good luck stopping to place it. The pitch ends at a substantial ledge about 60' above the ground.  A rap anchor exists on a tree in the crack system to the south, about 10' below and 10' to the south of the belay.\n\nNote if you find yourself midpitch, unwilling to commit desperate, tenuous stemming with a single #2 RP between you and the ledge, it is easy to traverse to the crack on the right, climb it (easy 5th class) traverse back to the Tanquerey belay, and rig a top rope.","protection":"This route is more serious than the S rating would imply -- S+ or S/VS is more like it.

Climb up the face with little protection (a large horn in the broken band at the start of Pins and Needles can be slung, awkwardly, for protection here) till your feet are on the break marked by a small fir sapling, the beginning of the crux.  From here a shallow micronut can be placed above in the seam.  Climb up and over the bulge with wide pinches and corner-ar√™te-slapping side-pulls to a finger slot, good gear, and easier climbing.  Follow the seam straight up the shallow, right-facing corner then up through an aesthetic overhanging finger crack in the right side of a slot. Continue straight up the ar√™te-corner through two more steep bulges to the top.\n\nUnfortunately, the route shares a hold with Pins and Needles, even though you climb directly up the offset seam 4-6¬í left of Pins and Needles.

This ledge is about 20 feet up, but you can belay from the ground. Climb the first few feet of Inverted Vee and then break left up a vague corner crack, pulling on somewhat suspect flakes.

After some hard-ish moves, you'll be at the base of a left-facing corner. Place a very key green Alien (bring a yellow Alien too, in case my memory is faulty), and then climb straight up the corner with tricky moves to a small tree.

It can be a frightening lead. Take a 4\" cam to reduce leg shake by placing in high and left at the top (crux)\n\nThe route is 5.9+ in the old rossiter book but has been \"downgraded\" to 10a in the new Levin book, eliminating the proper suspicion that it should be getting.  I interpret the 9+ as a height-dependent rating short person  (5'4\") might say \"plus several\"  I was glad to be 5'10\", but I'd still say +1.  Peter (5'8\") wished he were taller too, but he made it anyway.\n\nTo find the route, go up the West Ridge to the famous and popular\n\nPony Express\n\narea.  In the middle of this area is a tree, 1/2 way up on a sizable ledge.  The corner immediately left of this is\n\nPony Express\n\n.  Looking further left at ground level, about 20 feet left, is a flake, crack and corner system called\n\nZip Code\n\n.\n\nOne more system left of\n\nZip Code\n\nis a sizable, right-facing dihedral that goes 1/2 way up the wall to a large ledge (70').  The crack in the dihedral offers some generally poor and sparse protection, but it could hold a fall and is definitely better than nothing.\n\nClimb the dihedral up to the large ledge, moving left to the face and arete when necessary.  From the ledge, one can either climb up and right on more poorly protected face, merge and finish on Zip Code, or traverse left to a 5.8 crack system called\n\nCold Turkey\n\n.\n\nYou will probably be wigged out enough to take the latter two of these options with grace.","protection":"The pro up high is bad. In fact, it is mostly small and bad. The dihedral crack is mostly closed, with some iffy stoppers and some micro-cams or ball nuts. Aliens would probably be best due to their narrow width to get the best placement. So I've said some \"S\" routes are really \"S-\", but this route is \"S+\". The moves, while not terribly difficult, are somewhat insecure which adds to the stimulation of having little gear.
