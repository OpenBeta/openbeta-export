It's a bit strange, perhaps, but when you have enough love of climbing it becomes hard to separate climbing from all of the other things that compose one's life.

The existing information is somewhat ambiguous and it was not absolutely determinate how [far] we were to follow existing pitches (particularly on P2 of\n\nIgnominity\n\n), so we jumped off route as soon as possible to create a more [independent] line, or one AT LEAST as [independent] as intended.\n\nThis climb is a 1* or 2* climb, depending on how you look at it. It certainly has 2* sections, Is that enough to make the climb 2*, or do the 1* sections make it just 1*??? I guess 1.5* is good.\n\nTo find this climb, hike up the West Ridge to the base of\n\nLong John Wall\n\n, and then just a shave further to the base of\n\nIgnominity\n\n.\n\nP1: climb the first pitch of\n\nIgnominity\n\n(5.7), and continue up onto the second pitch for perhaps 15' (5.8) before taversing right below the first roof. This deviation goes around a bulge to the right and onto a slab, which is climbed DOWN and to the right to a shallow corner (5.10a). You will probably belay here due to drag. The belay is on #3 and #3.5 Camalot, + a few TCUs and/or a tricams.\n\nP2: climb up in a light colored crack that has a little resident chalk. This crack is shallow & a little flaky in spots, but it protects OK with a 1.5\" or 2\" cam. Continue up a very steep face as the crack disappears (5.10b). Pass a rotten band on some sidepulls (the gear is poor here, so don't fall (5.10a) and then step left to get a few SOLID nuts in a horizontal. Continue up the system of cracks for about 80' total to the ledge below\n\nLong John Wall's\n\n3rd pitch.\n\nP3: climb up the \"inset\" (stemming) of the 3rd pitch of\n\nLJW\n\nfor perhaps 15 feet (5.6) until the inset disappears and you can see a flake with a 2\" crack to your right. Step right onto this flake and jog upward and right on it (5.4?) before it terminates at a tiny left facing corner below a bulge. Go onto the corner and then left into a slot below the bulge. [Protect] overhead and climb the right hand of two crack through the bulge, using the one on the left as you please. This will bring you into a 5-foot wide \"inset\" with a crack on each side (left = thin fingers to seams, right = thin hands to wide fingers). Stemming this section is as nice as anything on\n\nLJW\n\nand is a great alternate pitch (5.9). Continue up on this to a broken ledge, being mindful not to drop rocks on your partner from the ledge. You will see a fixed rap station overhead, with blue webbing and one each, quicklink and rap ring. This is on a tree [which] is rooted behind a frightening looking flake. It is probably best to avoid this (death) rap. Big cams can be used to set a nice belay up and right of the top-out point, although you can find here and there placements for about anything.\n\nP4 as we did it was not [previously] documented and had no recognizable signs of prior passage. It may be a First Ascent- if it is, we will call it \"\n\nQuick Silver\n\n,\" but this is not known. If anyone has previously done this, please contact me with names and dates.\n\nP4: \"\n\nQuicksilver\n\n\" (5.9+). Here is where you get to use the big gear if you brought it. From the ledge previously mentioned, below the [death]-rap-station, climb up to the right and towards a 4-6\" crack though the roof at a right-facing dihedral/overhang. There is a death block teetering here, but it can be easily avoided. It looks to be about ~ 4' x 3' x 1' it is perhaps 8 [cubic] feet due to it's non-square shape, I figure this would weigh about 2000lbs. The point is, that it WILL KILL OR MAIM SOMEONE if you knock it off. So don't. [Stem] up past the flake and to the roof/crack. You can protect the roof at the base with a #3 Camalot or 3.5\" piece in a narrow spot (solid gear) and then stem higher and get in a solid 3.5\"-4\" cam. Protect, then pull up and left to the corner and over the roof (5.9+). During this crux, a #4 Camalot is optional, but the last [piece] is at your knees anyway. Continue up on easy hand-to-fist cracks protecting with 3\" gear, if you saved any (5.5) and up to a ledge and to the top of the ridge, now 20' right of the top of\n\nLJW\n\n.

The namesake song was going through my head whilst I lead this pitch.

Good moves and a nice long pitch.  It was very dirty- but now that 3 ascents have put some effort into cleaning the face for holds and crack to protect it, it is solid, though the route has a few flakes and some lichen on it.\n\nTo find this route, start at the Pony Express area. Rossiter's book has a topo on p213 that I will refer to, and an analogous photo on p212.\n\nBetween the routes\n\nDrug Abuse\n\nand\n\nSister Morphine\n\n, there is one additional route, Seemingly Innocent, which lies between them, but is not on the topo. This line is not well described in the book and not well defined. It likely shares some territory with P.S., but I do not know how much. Certainly there are differences, as there will be no mistaking their difficulty levels as similar (5.8 versus 5.10).\n\nTo climb P.S. start toward the right hand edge of the roof to the right of Drug Abuse. There is a 3.5\" to 4\" crack capped by a pinchable flake. Climb through the roof and up onto the flake (pinch hard) and get established. a 3.5-4 Camalot is crux pro and will keep you off of the ledge.  This is a bouldery 5.10 crux move, power is key. You can cheat to the right of the roof to avoid it all together if desired. Continue to force a line directly up the right-most of a handful of seams, continuing more or less striaght up. Into a right facing shallow corner, flip-flopping into a left-facing, shallow corner and then up some thin cracks and just right of a small triangular roof (well to the right of some vegetation). There are sections which have no crack just above that, but the climbing there is not crux. Perhaps 1/2 way up (70') a second crux (5.10) is passed in a thin crack. You will come up below just right of a small evergreen, with a 3rd crux (5.10) just above that getting from a few flaring thin-hands moves and into a solid finger lock with great pro there, after the move. Next, pass the small tree on the right.\n\nA 2 meter section of 4\" crack is right a few meters of this, but will not be obvious until you are above it. Nonetheless, it is a landmark.  From there the climbing is low angle. Go up and right to the massive pine tree to a fixed belay/rap.\n\nTo descend, rap from the massive tree. A single 70m gets you to the ground in a single rap, and MAYBE a 60m would too.

Steve Levin gives it 4-stars in his latest guidebook and I can't say that I disagree. While there is some junk thrown in the middle for good measure, the hard climbing is spectacular and is very well protected.\n\nP1: 5.10c, 80'. Begin with\n\nChick On The Side\n\n(which lies just below the start to\n\nHandcracker Direct\n\n). This pitch begins in an obtuse dihedral next to a pine tree. A good landmark is the fixed pin and chalked rail at about 25'. Stems, good locks, and some funk will bring you to the top of the dihedral. Stay true to the dihedral or step right after the crux. Either way, make your way up and belay after 80'. Move the belay left roughly 30'.\n\nP2: 5.10c, 110'. This pitch is the first pitch variation to\n\nMail Ridge\n\n. Start up a right-facing corner on good sidepulls and locks. The gear is great here. Fire up through an overhang using some underclinging trickery to a good stance. Follow easier (5.8+, 5.7, respectively) corners to a tree belay. There are rap rings around the tree. It should be noted that while the hard climbing is protected well enough, there are some spots above the crux (gaining the 5.8 corner) that are somewhat dicey. Small cams work well here. Also, on the day of our ascent there was a fixed nut at the crux that protected it very well- I would advocate to leave this in place as it makes protecting the crux that much easier.\n\nP3: 100', 5.5.

The second pitch is a great pitch to walk up to and do, it is fun and solid, and it protects with standard gear however you like.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"pbqyywfEUcakou93JX0vGA==","name":"Byway","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"Kent McClannan, Mike Alkaitis 2007","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28849,39.93203]},"left_right_index":33,"mp_id":"106124385","mp_crag_id":"105807742","climb_id":"pbqyywfEUcakou93JX0vGA==","areaRef":"lQVte9zBV7yOGEZ7jUx18w=="},"content":{"description":"This route starts up the last pitch of Rhombohedral (the obvious, wide crack/chimney on the north side of the formation that houses\n\nSooberb's\n\nlast pitch), but immediately traverses up and right to gain the prominent, twin crack system on a steep, hanging slab that faces north.","protection":"Standard Eldo rack- mainly small.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"unOOUDKYWFOJA6fZ5iCT7w==","name":"Barrel of Monkeys","yds":"5.11+","grades":{"yds":"5.11+","french":"7a"},"fa":"Mark and Scott Tarrant, 1994","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28849,39.93203]},"left_right_index":49,"mp_id":"105755320","mp_crag_id":"105807742","climb_id":"unOOUDKYWFOJA6fZ5iCT7w==","areaRef":"lQVte9zBV7yOGEZ7jUx18w=="},"content":{"description":"\"Barrel of Monkeys\" starts on the same shelf as \"\n\nThe Side Wall\n\n\", but on the far right side as for \"\n\nSooberb\n\n\".\n\nClimb up and right to a pine tree at the base of the \"Sick Flake\".  Climb behind the tree and on the outside of the flake to reach the first bolt. A long sling is helpful on this bolt.  The route is obvious from here, blasting up the steep wall above past the remaining 6 bolts.  There are 2 cruxes, one at the 2nd bolt (.11c/d), and one at the 6th bolt (.11c).  The first crux involves some tricky footwork and a longish reach to the right. A fun, well-protected section (.10c) with decent rests leads to the higher crux which is strenuous and deceptive.  From here, the route moves slightly left to a blunt arete and then up and right to the anchor. This is one of the few pure sport routes in Eldo and is a nice departure from some of the scarier routes in \"\n\nThe Side Wall\n\n\" area.\n\nThe rock is excellent and the moves are very fun.  It gets no stars in the new Eldo guide, but is well deserving of 2+ stars.  The only complaint is that the anchor is over the top of the steep climbing, so there is quite a bit of rope-drag when lowering and following on toprope.  Also, be careful when lowering since the leader will end up about 25 feet to the right and about 80 feet above the ground (swing or climb back to the ledge).","protection":"7 bolts + 2-bolt anchor.
