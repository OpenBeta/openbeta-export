Make your way to the base of Quartzite Crag, and jump on the ridge. Continue up, staying near the ridge crest for the most solid rock and fun climbing. While the majority of this route is easy 5th to 3rd class, several short vertical to overhanging bulges and corners will keep you on your toes.","protection":"Protection is possible, but all of the harder climbing is directly above large ledges so this most likely makes a better solo.","location":"Start at the base of Quartzite Crag, and climb until the rock runs out.
