From the bolt go up and left on mild runouts through easier territory, aiming for the bottom left side of a hanging flake.  Place gear along the way on long runners if desired. On the hanging flake, you can place a 0.75\" (+/-) cam or two on a long runner on its left side before launching out under it and up under it to the right, where another cam can be placed 1-1.5\" before rising up under the flake (5.10b/c, S?) to a right-facing corner to reach the bolt and chain anchor.

While it is only feet from the road it took me 18 years to get around to it.  No matter the option taken to finish the route, there are some flaws, and are some nicer sections.  The overall balance makes the route one worth doing for the completist, and not totally worthy of shunning for the rest of the community.\n\nThe crux may be in the interesting climbing  (10a) done getting to the shared section of P2 of\n\nMarch Of Dimes\n\n, or perhaps that shared section of\n\nMarch of Dimes\n\n(10a), or best of all, going slightly right and connecting to the 2nd pitch variant for\n\nMarch Of Dimes\n\n(10c) that is just to the right.\n\nIn any case, some occasional grit from lack of travel makes this route one for the experienced climber.  Also, note that the route takes poor stoppers and is pretty much tip-sized cams (0.3\") for most of the way.  I didn't have that size and was less than pleased with my options for protection a few times.\n\nP1: (70' Cl4, dirty) Start off on the left side of the\n\nMarch Of Dimes\n\nButtress in a junky gully/ramp.

A very large, upright flake punctuates the brown area where rockfall more recent than the surroundings has revealed cleaner stone and a flake that appears to be somewhat precarious.  Head up to that flake on the brown area with the yellow lichen above and right.  Climb either side of it for a crux (left, 10a, right 10c) that is thin (blue Alien, perhaps?) and steep.  Continue up onto lower angle rock and flee right to the belay as for\n\nWerk Supp\n\nor run it out a little more to the top of the ledge directly over the flake (5.8?) and belay at a good tree.\n\nP3: (5.3- 5.10c, depending) Three choices here:\n\nA.

Well here it is.  Find this obscure short pitch just above the first pitch of March of Dimes or starting perhaps 15 feet L of the upper 70 feet of Werk Supp's first pitch on the North Face of the Bastille.\n\nDescribed by Rossiter's guide as \"this pitch parallels the upper half of P1 of Werk Supp on the left.\"  This route probably warrants the bomb rating for the rock bomb potential at least along the line we took.  From the little saddle behind the March of Dimes buttress, move slightly R and find a bugaboo (or KB?) a few feet off the ground.  You can try to find ways past the pin to the R to avoid touching this huge, tilted, detached flake (now removed) precariously perched up and L of this pin, but neither of us felt it was less than 5.10.  Certainly, moving up and R seemed likely to enter X or VS range (if this is the actual line, you should ignore this next bit about the flake and the rating).  Then again, so did up and L.\n\nOur efforts required a gentle lieback on this flake (now removed) and fearful stepping upon it to traverse L.  The upper part of this flake shifted an inch with gentle outward pressure inward or outward.  Arrggghhhh!  Reminiscent of Cannon Mountain (NH) rock, this huge block could take out the belay or belayer below and would definitely take out a car on the road.  Don't think you're safe yet.  As you gain this up and R ramp, you must face other stacked blocks that make you try to minimize your presence.\n\nFinally, reach a decent angle pin (partially hidden under a lump of grass in the crack) in solid rock.  From here the route is more technically but less psychologically difficult.  Continue up to a KB.  Here you go up and highstep L into a briefly fractured band.  Climb past what-appears-to-be a soft iron pin and reach the belay thankful for metastabilities.  On the positive side, at least none of the 4 pins shift with hand pressure.\n\nPerhaps somethings are better not climbed.","protection":"4 pins (in situ), hmmm, not much else.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"xEZ8y+WVW4ql1LCLmgYcTA==","name":"The Bastille Crack","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"US Army climbers, 1954.

Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb.\n\nThe climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon. As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, \"avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm.\"\n\nStart at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right.\n\nThe first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it.\n\nP1. 5.7, 60'. Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains. You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch.\n\nP2. 5.6, 90'. Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face. Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall. Belay at a crack with a fixed pin. If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance.\n\nVariation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8. Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line.\n\nP1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope.\n\nP3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux). Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge. A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor.\n\nP1-3 can be combined with a 70m rope.\n\nP4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner. Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation. Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.\n\nP5. Several options here:\n\na. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'. Climb the chimney to the top.\n\nb. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top.\n\nc. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80'. Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation.\n\nTo descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30' right (west) and then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff.\n\n(Ed.
