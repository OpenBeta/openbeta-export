This does not significantly change the overall grade of the route, but will make the first section of 5.6 climbing less protected.\n\nFrom the Red Ledge, which can be reached by climbing one of many Redgarden routes such as\n\nSwanson Arete\n\n(for an easy approach), or the\n\nWest Chimney\n\n(not recommended), or the first 3 pitches of\n\nYellow Spur\n\n, or...  In fact, you can traverse from almost anywhere on the Red Ledge, including from the routes\n\nGreat Zot\n\n,\n\nGrandmother's Challenge\n\n, or\n\nGreen Spur\n\n- if you are willing to traverse a little way.\n\nOnce on the ledge, traverse south toward the fantastic dihedral and arete of Tower One, toward the visible top pitch of the Yellow Spur.  As you pass the great dihedral (bearing the appropriately named route \"The Dirty Deed\", start looking upward.  While the original route went up the chimney a bit before traversing out right to a crack system (20-30' right of the dihedral) it is possible to go directly up from the ground, which may make the start more like 5.6 than 5.4.  This is approximately 1/2 way between\n\nDaedalus\n\nand the\n\nDirty Deed\n\nDihedral (chimney).\n\nGo straight up this crack system until it ends and then beyond to a medium pine tree on a small ledge, about 90' up.  A larger pine is up and left in the dihedral.  Belay at the medium pine, or continue upward on Pitch 2.\n\nPitch two goes up and slightly right in another crack system to the left-hand edge of the ledge bearing the large pine tree, another 90' up, or so.  Linking these probably requires a 60m rope.  (I used a 70m and had plenty left.)  Belay in the crack above the ledge at its left edge, or at the base of the large pine as for\n\nDaedalus\n\n.\n\nIf you have not linked pitches 1 and 2, linking pitches 2 and 3 is an option.  Again, linking these might require a 60m rope.\n\nPitch 3.  Climb the obvious hand and finger crack from the left side of this ledge to the top of the cliff.  There are good jams on easy terrain here as well as some face climbing.  Belay from above and then descend as for the\n\nYellow Spur\n\n.\n\nThis route is nice climbing with nice views, and is reasonably safe, but requires some distance between pieces.  Mental constitution is more important on this route than hard-core ability, so I don't recommend it as a first lead.

For this variation, traverse down and left on runout 5.6 from the belay.  Head up for and obvious bolt and continue up a sort of arete with an delicate 11 section after the pin.  Continue up on 5.7 climbing to a small belay ledge at the base of the beautiful 70 degree slab.\n\nThe normal way to do this pitch is to traverse in from the left, above the bolts on nebulous terrain to join the second half of the pitch I just described (8+).\n\nThe fourth pitch is the best on the route, and is the route's technical and psychological crux.  This pitch checks in at about 10c with delicate balancy laybacks and precise footwork.  Climb up to the obvious bolt fifteen feet above the belay.  The crux is the twenty-foot section above this bolt.  Head for a shallow left-facing dihedral with a pin scar.  Make a scary blind placement (small TCU, or stopper) hope that it is good (you can indeed get a good placement here, if you spend too much time trying to place this piece and fall, you will probably hit the belay ledge, not a good prospect) and climb right of the dihedral for ten more scary feet to reach a good hold. (If the TCU blows on a fall from this section, injury is almost definite, however as I said you can if you are patient get a good piece in here that will hold a fall from the crux moves above, it is a hard piece to place though).  Continue up on slightly scary 5.9 that traverses left under an overhang and surmount this on good holds on the left (9), do some 5.8 out right to reach the upper ramp.  This pitch is about 10c overall and instead of requiring pure strength, requires a good sense of body position and good footwork.","protection":"Bring a purple Metolius TCU or equivalent for the crux.

P1 is mostly just hard (impossible for me) with difficult gear. P2 is spectacular but easier.

Art Higbee (Art's Spar) is a little less known than Wunsch and Bragg, but Art climbed a lot with Jim Erickson including on the free ascent of Half Dome (see the movie).\n\nErickson's 1980 guide says, \"Slightly less severe than PSYCHOSIS, yet analysis and commitment may be necessary.\" He also says of P1, \"...conquer a minor overhang...\" The \"minor\" overhang is a large and very difficult roof, and the crux of the climb. Did something break off since the first ascent? I'm good at roofs and can climb most Eldo routes to easy 11, although sometimes with hangs and falls. I could not do this roof despite many attempts. I'd like to hear from any 5.11 climber who can do this. The way that almost worked for me was to stem with a low left hand jam, long reach for a good pinch at the lip, and try to pull on that pinch to reach the good hold.\n\nApproach:Hike up to the west side of Redgarden. After the steel ladder, continue past a couple more switchbacks until you can cut back right on a ledge that leads to Psychosis and Vertigo. This is one level below the start of Yellow Spur. Psychosis starts just left of the largest tree on this ledge. Neurosis starts about 12 feet left of Psychosis at a right facing dihedral. For a warm-up, you can climb from below to this point via Schizophrenia (5.8) or one of the harder climbs on either side of that.\n\nP1 10d++ S?:This is rated S in Rossiter's guide. If you're tall (I'm 6'2\" with mediocre reach), it's not S, but perhaps \"protection difficult.\" Climb the initial corner at about 5.9 with barely adequate gear. Move very carefully onto the ledge on the left. There is lots of loose gravel and some bigger rocks on this slanting ledge that want to fall off. The belayer should be wearing a helmet and be out of the fall line (rope, too). Get good gear on the underside of the roof. I used HB offset nuts and some small cams. Move right on a large block under the roof with a horizontal crack and buckets. The left side of this block is suspect. You can get some gear on the right side. You can place a blue Ballnut in the roof. From the ledge on the left, if you are tall, you can place a very good #3/blue Camalot in the obvious slot at the lip. This topropes the crux. As I said above, I couldn't do the crux, so I can't offer any advice here. A very long reach will work. Perhaps a hand jam where the blue Camalot is (and place the cam after getting the good hold). Perhaps left hand on some small sidepulls. Climbing from directly below puts the lip much further away. Some combination of heel hooks with sloper holds might work. Pulling over the lip is 5.9 or so on good holds. You can place a 0.75/green Camalot before you pull over the lip. Above this the climbing is maybe 5.8. I placed gear in the main corner but climbed a bit further right where it was cleaner and less steep. Gear is sparse but adequate. It's not obvious where to belay. Traverse left around the main corner to a hidden ledge. Further left and down on this ledge are good cracks taking green and yellow Aliens and a 0.5 Camalot. You can protect the second on this traverse with a yellow Alien or medium nut above the big horizontal crack.\n\nThere is a variation to the left of the crux roof that is apparently 10a. Looking down from above, it looked pretty dirty above the roof on that variation.\n\nP2 9+:The second pitch is the best pitch. It looks pretty hard from the ground, and it is pretty hard at about 9+. Gear and rock is good, but you have to work for the gear at a few places. Like the regular 2nd pitch of Psychosis, it's very steep, but with more interesting moves and better rock than Psychosis. When you top out, there are a few gear placements, but the rock is a bit suspect. I prefer to move right and down to a very good horizontal crack that takes hand-sized cams (#2 and #3 Camalots). Up and right from there is an excellent 1\" cam placement. This belay is a little less comfortable than up and left, but safer, and there's more rope out for the initial hard moves of P3.\n\nP3 10d:I first did this pitch accidentally thinking it was the 10d variation of Psychosis. The guidebooks say climb to the roof and move right, but you actually climb right about 15' below the roof. Climb the shallow right facing corner that is left of Psychosis. The first 10' of this is a little loose, and gear is difficult, but available. Continue up the corner as high as you can to place gear. The climbing is about 5.9. Step down a bit and move right onto some decent handholds. It may be possible to traverse straight right from here and avoid grief later, but we traversed diagonally down and right (first crux) to the shallow left facing corner. It's very difficult hanging out at this point to get gear. Get a good high nut. (Double ropes useful! One high on the left and one running low across the face to this point.) Make hard moves up the crack and then desperately reach an obvious crystal/flake on the arête, and escape right into an easy corner (top of Psychosis). It may be possible to continue up the crack without moving around the arête, but it's very steep and a little dirty. Rossiter just says of this pitch, \"...traverse right (10d), and up to the top.\"","protection":"Double cams from microcams to #2/gold Camalot, #3/blue Camalot. 1 or 2 sets of micronuts.

Alternatively, you could substitute\n\nThe Exterminator\n\n(11b R) if you wanted to add some spice.\n\nPitch 4:\n\nWingshot\n\n, 11b. Belay all the way at the top. Alternatively, you could do\n\nWishbone\n\n,11c. Walk off to the North towards the Kloof alcove.\n\nPitch 5:\n\nKloof\n\n, 11a.

As a variation to the\n\nGrand Giraffe\n\n, Art's Spar makes a largely fun link up that catches the roof that was actually dodged by the\n\nGrand Giraffe\n\n. I will add a story to this description because it must rank as one of the all time classic epics that should have ended in disaster, but instead saved the life of it's chief protagonist.\n\nBegin Art's Spar at the top of the Lower Ramp as you would for\n\nRuper\n\n.  Following the\n\nGrand Giraffe\n\n, a pitch of 5.8 followed by a pitch of 5.4 takes you to the belay below the roof; stay in the 5.9 corner for the\n\nGiraffe\n\nor cut right and over the roof for Art's Spar. On the Upper Ramp, one has any of numerous choices to finish the headwall and catch the East Slabs. And this is a great route.\n\nNow, I may burn in hell for telling this story, but it is too good not to tell. Fifteen years ago in September I did Art's Spar with a super athlete/climber who I will call DK to preserve my own hide. DK, as most masculine hunks, had hugely more balls than brains, although he did survive this epic so he must have had some sense of self-preservation - or luck.\n\nWe hit the Lower Ramp with just over one hour of sunlight remaining, and waltzed up the first two pitches to the\n\nGrand Giraffe\n\nbelay below the roof at Art's Spar at approximately sunset. DK led the roof in classic, flawless style, but this took 45 minutes, which amounted to 45 min after the sun had set - dark in other words. Thinking of the exit off the Upper Ramp, the East Slabs, and the enclosing darkness, I suggested to DK that he rap back down to my belay from which we would descend via raps to the Lower Ramp and then rap this to the West. Agreed, he set up a rap and started down. Now, bear in mind that the roof is 300 ft off the deck. About 6 or 7 ft from the lip, DK stalled out and stopped his rappel.  I inquired as his status and the progress of his rappel, to which I received a series of garbled grunts in response. After close to 10 minutes, perched above the Art's Spar roof, DK emitted a single sharp curse, SHIT!! In the silence that ensued, I heard the three notes that have burned themselves into my memory, perhaps forever: \"PING!! Ping!  ping....\" \"DK\", I inquired with feigned calm ,\"what was that?\" ....  \"I just dropped my figure 8\", he responded. In other words, while rappelling with the figure 8, DK managed to drop the very same device with which he was rappelling. Nifty.\n\nAt that time I was wagering to myself at close to 5% chance of DK living through this evolving epic, perhaps a bit less, but since it was DK I would go with 5%. However, with a little school boy hand-over-hand rope climbing, DK did manage to get close enough to the belay for me to get a rope wrapped around his legs, then his waist, and get him back to the belay to continue our pleasant outing, which we did, under the cover of darkness. This was the last day that DK climbed. He even survived to marry the most beautiful woman in the universe; now both are happy.","protection":"Bring a full rack and a standard 50 or 60 m rope.

Both pitches are pretty spicey.  Nearly all of the holds are huge, and the climbing is vertical or overhanging.  Do any route that reaches the Upper Ramp to get to the base; the climb would make a fitting finale for\n\nRosy Crucifixion\n\n.  A huge cave/overhang sits near the upper part of the ramp, just left of the upper pitches of\n\nRuper\n\n; above it is a pocketed wall and another prominent roof band.  The route starts at the right side of the cave.\n\nPitch one: Climb up an easy ramp to the right margin of the overhang, which at this point is a blind corner.  Place protection overhead in the curving roof/dihedral and feel around the corner for the proper place to get established on the face (scary 5.8).  An astute runout back to the left will be necessary to prevent horrendous rope drag.  Follow a crack/seam steadily up left, with reasonable protection, and belay down and left from the apex of the upper roof (variable number of pins).  Don't be fooled (as I was) by the line of huge holds just above the cave; they lead to some very dangerous climbing if one is to stay on route.\n\nPitch two: Traverse up and right from the hanging belay, and turn the roof (crux, small gear at your feet) right of its apex, where it begins to bend down to the right.  Work up and slightly left over a steep wall into an obtuse left-facing corner which provides an exciting finale; belay above.  A considerably more mellow fifty feet finds the top (shared with Ruper).  Go west to the rappel (described under\n\nRuper\n\n,\n\nYellow Spur\n\n,\n\netc.\n\n) or east to the east slabs descent.","protection":"Standard rack, a #3 Camalot or the like could come in handy.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"KiDNZQDTX8eh0GK+wmWkdw==","name":"The Art Of Slappiness","yds":"5.13b","grades":{"yds":"5.13b","french":"8a"},"fa":"FFA: Chris Weidner  10/03/07","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28603,39.93194]},"left_right_index":27,"mp_id":"106044132","mp_crag_id":"105807695","climb_id":"KiDNZQDTX8eh0GK+wmWkdw==","areaRef":"PfmL73yMUUup7qmJtdjT6A=="},"content":{"description":"The Art Of Slappiness ascends the overhanging arete left of\n\nVertigo's\n\nsecond pitch.
