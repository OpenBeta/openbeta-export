Do a sit down start up the leaning crack on the left side of the south face, and then hand traverse right along the seam with decent hands but bad feet until it turns into a mellow slab. This is a bit sharp but quite fun- - it gets a strong two stars. It felt more like V3 to me (the grade is from\n\nColorado Bouldering - Front Range\n\n).\n\nInstead of hand traversing, you can also finish straight up above the initial crack, which is a cool couple of moves with some pockets, a hidden crimp, and a pseudo-mantel. That is perhaps a little easier than the traverse, but it is headier.","protection":"A pad and a spotter are optional - it's pretty low to the ground, although on the last few difficult moves, you're a bit higher and could potentially twist an ankle if you landed unluckily on one of the wooden steps below the boulder.
