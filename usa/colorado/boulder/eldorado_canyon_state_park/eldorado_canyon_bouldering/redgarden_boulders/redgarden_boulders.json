The problem starts on a good, flat jug in the slot about 15 feet above the base of Dangerous Acquaintances and moves left along the slot, both under and at the lip, until you enter the opening moves on the Wisdom and can step off to the left.\n\nThe landing is a bit steep and slick in places so take care to step off before you fall off. Some flakes look suspect as well (one seems to be held on with a wad of chewing gum)! This is a fairly continous, pumpy rig with about 50 feet of climbing on it -- it just happens to be in a grotty spot.","protection":"A thick T-shirt.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,7fea44a6-af9d-583e-9abc-274876289cd7,e3b2321d-78e7-5162-8e08-8a7c08aaf306,402f934b-9f6e-5948-a13f-718fa1d79b4e","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Eldorado Canyon State Park","Eldorado Canyon Bouldering","Redgarden Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V9"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2881,39.92981]},"bbox":[-105.28868638735052,39.92936033981814,-105.28751361264948,39.93025966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106731896","area_id":"QC+TS59uWUihP3GPodebTg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:58.561Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:44.341Z"}
