From the good, incut sidepull, go up to the gorgeous, slopey, vertical rail. Do a long pull to a good crimp, and cruise your way up to the top.\n\nI cleaned some big blocks out of the top corner, but there's still some smaller loose stuff up there that I could've kept cleaning till forever. I recommend checking it out on a toprope or treading lightly. One big block immediately after the move to the crimp is loose but wouldn't come out. It's very easy to avoid, I left a brushed X on it. Despite my warnings of choss, the line is really good, and the crux is on bullet rock.\n\nIf anyone has done this previously, please let me know.
