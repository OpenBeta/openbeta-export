It comes out of the hole off a big jug with barely any feet.  As the name implies, a kneebar gets you through the first move, and a knee bar pad helps.  Climb up through some tension, thuggish moves to good crimps.  Head up to the \"crimp block\" and up over through crimps and slopers to the scary but protectable topout.  There are a lot of moves on this one.  It is very atypical for Eldo.  It is mostly big holds with big moves.  We are not necessarily claiming the FA, but Bob Horan commented that he had never seen anyone on it, and we also did a lot of cleaning on the topout!  This is a VERY good problem for the grade.  It is a great addition, go try this thing with a group, and bring a kneebar pad!  Proud line!","protection":"4-5 pads is ideal.  This makes it much nicer to commit to the topout.  At least 2 pads are needed.","location":"The problem is in the corridor below\n\nGerm Free\n\n.
