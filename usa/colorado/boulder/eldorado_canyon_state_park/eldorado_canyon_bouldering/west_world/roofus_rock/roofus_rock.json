Start on the left side of the slightly overhung face with a left hand dish/crimp and a right hand, small, undercling crimp. Make a hard move off the ground, then continue right with bad feet and little crimps and slots. From here, use technique and crimp strength to makeÂ some big hard moves to the good rail just under the apex of the boulder. Top out along the arete at around 20 feet.","protection":"At least 3 pads.","location":"This is on the far left face of Roofus Rock.
