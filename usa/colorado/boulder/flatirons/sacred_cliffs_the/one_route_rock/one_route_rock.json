The dogs and Kat were the only ones up there on what was a busy day everywhere else.\n\nThe climbing starts just left of a left-facing corner at the North end of the West Face of the Rock.  Climb in from the left on face moves to avoid some bad rock and to the top of the corner, where a good ledge is reached.  Place overhead gear in the crack up and left, get some confidence and go for it.  Steep jamming on an uneven and sometimes flaring crack takes you past some cobbles for feet and to lower angle climbing.  Finish out up on top with wide gear (#3.5 or #4 Camalot + a nut or two) for an anchor.\n\nTo descend, scramble off to the Southeast.","protection":"Cams from 1\" to 3\" plus a larger cam for the anchor up top.","location":"This route is the obvious corner and crack system on the North end of the West face of 'One Route Rock'."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,f4f976d7-c9ca-5a50-a1ec-cf40ad03859a,a583a19e-685e-50b2-980e-c7da9b023d98","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","Sacred Cliffs, The","One Route Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.30126,39.98233]},"bbox":[-105.30184683784627,39.98188033981813,-105.30067316215373,39.982779660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106528773","area_id":"pYOhnmheULKYDsfamwI9mA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:02.656Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:37.339Z"}
