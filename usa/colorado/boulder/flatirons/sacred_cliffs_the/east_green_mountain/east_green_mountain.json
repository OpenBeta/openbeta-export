The crack varies from wide fingers to difficult-to-utilize seams. The climb is on a steep, 80 degrees slab and the face itself lacks holds better than pebbles, so having some finger crack technique can be very helpful.\n\nThe first ascent (and original name) is currently unknown, but it's an obvious crack in a well-traveled area, so who knows?","protection":"It's a high-enough boulder to consider what would happen if you peel off and the slabby nature makes things a little more complicated. There's an OK but not GREAT landing. The crack could accept small gear (theoretically), but it's suggested to go into the climb as a solo and commit. It's a long way to bring up a bouldering pad.
