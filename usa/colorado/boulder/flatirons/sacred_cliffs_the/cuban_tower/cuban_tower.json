Climb the crack (wide and rotten at first, narrowing to almost fingers, and widening to hands). I often had to stop and scrape a lot of crusty lichen out of the crack, with one hand, while painfully jamming with the other. This led me to believe that no one had previously climbed it. I belayed at the top of the crack on a pillar/pedestal. Btw this is the same crack that the adjacent route, Bay of Pigs, ascends. I think that BoP was first climbed in the late ‘80s.\n\nThe second pitch was much easier. It continued up a short dihedral, then traversed east, across the south side, to the east-facing, low-angled slab, following that to the summit. We scrambled down east, then south.\n\nNo bolts and pins were anywhere on the rock. We didn’t name the route, nor did we report it to the “authorities.”  We didn’t name Cuban Tower, either — I don’t see any resemblance to Cuba (where I have climbed).","protection":"A standard rack through a #4, or bigger, although the biggest piece on my usual 1983 rack was the original #4 Friend, which is similar in size to a #3.5 Camalot.","location":"Start below the obvious chimney/slot on the right side of the face."},"__v":0},{"_id":"NEYoLs4sWeeF3Te/EuLwFA==","name":"Bay of Pigs","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Bill DeMallie (?), late ‘80s","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.30157,39.98195]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118756027","mp_crag_id":"105746569","climb_id":"NEYoLs4sWeeF3Te/EuLwFA==","areaRef":"vGq7cDKxVCSNOQq9grpDxQ=="},"content":{"description":"This route is in the Rossiter and Haas guidebooks to the Flatirons. I led the first pitch on January 8, 1995. My partner was unable to follow, so I didn’t do pitch two until yesterday, when I followed David Light up both pitches.\n\nPitch one climbs 25 feet to a 3/8” bolt that has an old SMC hanger. There’s a nut placement in a horizontal just before this bolt and a good placement for a small nut a few feet above the bolt and just below an old fixed wire.  Continue up a steep seam, past a pin and a bolt, to a two-pin-and-bolt optional belay at about 50-60 feet (10d R).\n\nContinue up and right, past a blind placement for a #4 Rock or #7 Stopper, to the base of the prominent overhanging-to-vertical crack. This 5.10 crack starts out wide, tapers down almost to fingers, then opens up to hands. It ends atop a pillar. Belay from gear placements and one bolt.\n\nPitch two steps down, traverses left to a bolt, and wanders up and left, past six more bolts (5.10), to the summit. From a two-bolt anchor on top, a 140-foot rappel reaches the ground. David and I rapped 100 feet to a ledge from which scrambling south (not easy) or north (easy, longer) reaches the ground.","protection":"A full rack through a #3 for the crack. David left his #4 on the ground and used his #3 as part of the belay anchor. Because the bolts and pins are >30 years old, I wouldn’t trust those much.
