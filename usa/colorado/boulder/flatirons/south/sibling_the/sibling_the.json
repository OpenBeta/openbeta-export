The best approach to this is either up to the North side and then up around to the West, or going West until parallel with the top of the rock and slightly above, then dropping down into the West face from the South.\n\nThis climb ascends the acute arete on the Northwest Corner. The climbing is relatively steep and thin in places, with a crux 1/3 of the way up. The pro is adequate, but adequate only to prevent serious injury, it would probably not be comforting. This is probably not a good climb to 'push' on, nor one for a beginning leader.\n\nClimb up the first few moves and start placing pro where possible. Pass the crux on a relatively steep section and protect a little more before ascending up the ever sharpening and exposed arete. Small incuts and edges up high make the top half of the climb fun and interesting as well. Finish by hitting the \"true summit\" of the rock, left of the fixed anchor, protect that, then scramble down a few meters and belay. A 'slingshot' belay here is a good idea to protect the second; protect above where you set the stance.\n\nTo descend, rap from the fixed anchor.","protection":"A standard light rack. 1 set stoppers and cams.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Wv4InnBoUIahVnnYuWSHug==","name":"Direct North Face","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"T.

There are 2 possibilities here, the direct, and the 'non-direct' traverse-in. The second (non-direct) eliminates most of the technical difficulty, but also most of the grunge. It is also probably a better route, as it still hits all of the 'fun' climbing.\n\nThe best approach to this route is probably up to the North side of the rock from Shadow Canyon trail, but we had been on the west side and dropped down to there from the West face, which we approached from the South.\n\nThis climb ascends the North Face from near an old, rotted-out tree stump. The relatively direct line of climbing first ascends a face for 40 or 50 feet (5.10, S/VS) to intersect a series of diagonal 'slashes' that are very well protected (5.10a) and rides those to the top of the rock, perhaps 3 meters East of the true summit.\n\nAlternatively, one can traverse in to the system of cracks from near the NW arete, at it's base.  The route is given 1 star. That describes my experience with it, including some cleaning of loose rock and lichen. My partner enjoyed it more than did I. I will probably be more of a 2-star route once it is well-cleaned.\n\nBe mindful of the loose blocks on top when setting an anchor. Not all that glitters is gold. To descend, rap from the fixed anchor on the rock's west end.","protection":"At present it was only TR'd to clean and inspect.

Step right (South) onto the center of the West face and diagonal up and right a few feet to a crack and corner system. Follow a right-facing corner up to a roof formed by a huge chockstone.
