Looking at the entire feature from the saddle on the Fern Canyon trail, there are three distinct slabs separated by vegetated gullies.  This climb is the farthest climber's right (north) of the three.  Bushwhack down from the saddle or up from Bear Canyon trail until you are at the base.\n\nThere is no distinct ending to the route, for the descent downclimb one of the notches that breaks the ridgeline.  From there, hike down to Bear Canyon trail.
