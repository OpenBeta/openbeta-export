If you are planning a trip up the left side of Seal Rock and are an aficionado of obscure Flatirons, this might be worth a quick detour.  The crux is near the bottom, nothing too hard, but the lack of traffic keeps it dirty and covered in pine needles.  Once you reach the left-facing flake, there is plenty of gear if you want it.  Higher on the face the easiest path is through a section of dark brown rock that is pretty loose and flakey.   You can avoid it by staying left. With a 70m rope, you can easily make the top in one pitch.  If not, there are a few good spots to belay from....","protection":"A few cams and nuts, or just solo.","location":"Start on the lowest point of the East Face.\n\nThere are a couple of ways off the top:\n\n1) Down-climb through a slot to the west.  This is easier if you are tall.  Harder than the route if short, but still doable....  It seems like there would be a nasty tumble if you blow it, but it's easier than it looks.\n\n2) Down-climb a little ways down the east ridge until you can reach a ledge system that heads SW back into the hillside.

It looked easy, but we already went down the slot...."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,ee2fde9f-b2c2-58e8-ad07-ff56ccf69c8a,00d2f791-12b3-5de1-a3f7-4a2a177aca80","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","South","Penguin, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.289,39.9611]},"bbox":[-105.28958665560106,39.96065033981814,-105.28841334439892,39.961549660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107626759","area_id":"ANL3kRKzXeGj90oqF3rKgA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:55.099Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:37.626Z"}
