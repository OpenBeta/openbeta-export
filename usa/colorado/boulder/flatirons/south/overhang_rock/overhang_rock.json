The Ouroboros often symbolizes self-reflexivity or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself, the eternal return, and other things such as the phoenix which operate in cycles that begin anew as soon as they end.

A 70m rope is mandatory!","location":"The best way to approach this climb (and all the other climbs on the West Face of Overhang) is to walk up the Bear Canyon trail until you come to the huge boulder on the left side of the trail (the\n\nShelf Block\n\n). Just before the boulder there is a climber's trail leading up and left into the woods. Follow the trail up past a few boulders, contouring and following a few cairns until you reach the big flat rock directly under the power line. From there, head straight up the talus (walking parallel to the cliff) for about 15 yards until you can break left through the woods onto the main talus field below the West Face. Wander across the talus to the base of the climb.  The climb starts approximately 40 feet right of\n\nSnake Watching\n\n. Start by a small tree atop a ramp."},"__v":0},{"_id":"NmdR4aboWOmksoS4AK/4jw==","name":"East Face","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28729,39.9706]},"left_right_index":15,"mp_id":"105756589","mp_crag_id":"105745115","climb_id":"NmdR4aboWOmksoS4AK/4jw==","areaRef":"SrBGMBmDWOeShgCpFQV0YA=="},"content":{"description":"As implied by its name, this routes is on the East Face of the rock way up closer to the Southern end of it.\n\nApproach as mentioned on the rock description.\n\nThe route starts some 50 feet to the right (North) of the obvious notch at the top of the rock (left of the summit).\n\nP-1 Climbs left following a crack/strata that leads towards a large tree at the base of the notch. This crack is a bit dirty and vegetated.\n\nAs a cleaner, more fun alternative, you can tackle the small overhang directly below the notch. The overhang is a bit awkward but goes at about 5.7 and has adequate protection although you need to work for it. Once you clear the overhang continue up a right facing flake and onto a one move 5.7 slab. Merge right with the original route and belay at the top of the notch (past the tree). This pitch is exactly 100ft.\n\nP-2 At the notch as you look towards the summit to the North, you will be faced by a sharp arete. To its left is an imposing overhang with few features. To the right and about 15 feet up, a flake invites passage to the East face. This is a really exposed pitch.\n\nClimb up the sharp arete and clip the three ancient pitons (two of which seemed solid). Take note of the large rocks you are yanking on since the top one (spike at the top) looks ready to come off.\n\nOnce you reach the flake traverse right and down onto an improbable and awkward slopping ramp that tappers off to nothing as you traverse it. Placements are available at the end of the traverse. Look between your legs and see a clear shot at the packs you left at the base. You are now above the large overhang on the East Face.\n\nMake a tricky move to reach an easy but somewhat loose ramp that will deliver you to the summit some 30 feet up.\n\nRope drag is a major issue. Long slings and a strong stomach are a must.\n\nDescent - Rappel from the summit to the tree at the foot of the notch. Two ancient pins exist behind the summit block. A long (20+ft) sling can also be slinged around the summit block.\n\nWith a 60m rope we were able to rappel all the way to the ground by-passing the second rappel from the notch tree.","protection":"Standard rack, long slings are a must.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,ee2fde9f-b2c2-58e8-ad07-ff56ccf69c8a,4ab04630-1983-58e7-9286-00a915057460","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","South","Overhang Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.6"},{"count":3,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":6,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":5,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":10,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":6,"expert":4}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":5,"intermediate":1,"advanced":6,"expert":4}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28729,39.9706]},"bbox":[-105.2878767371282,39.97015033981814,-105.28670326287181,39.971049660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745115","area_id":"SrBGMBmDWOeShgCpFQV0YA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":16,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:55.100Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:26.203Z"}
