This climb can be made safe, but it requires good judgment in both using holds and placing protection.  There are loose flakes in and around the crack.  In summary, this is not a good climb to push for if close to one's grade or for a new trad leader.\n\nIt is a good climb solidly into the 5.10 grade.  Consider wearing sleeves and tape gloves to protect yourself against sharp edges.","protection":"A single set of cams from 1\" to #4 Camalot.  A very large cam can be used up top, but there are other alternatives for protection there, including a 1\" cam out to the left of the main crack.  A new #4 Camalot is the crux pro.  An old one is a little large, and a #3 is in a questionable area of rock.  So take the new #4.","location":"The route lies practically on the Fern Canyon trail, and it is the right-facing crack/flake/corner that faces South on the Superfresh block.  Head up and into it placing your full set of cams starting at just under 2\" and working up to 4-5\", with a small cam optional up top (1-1.5\").\n\nAbove the corner system, belay on 2 small trees.  To retreat, scramble West on the ledge with the 2 small trees, then go North up a slab to a large tree, then down the Northwest-most prow of the block to the base (5.4)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"aWY9Or2ZWoyg8np4CeAIxA==","name":"Superfresh","yds":"5.12d","grades":{"yds":"5.12d","french":"7c"},"fa":"Colin Lantz, 1989","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28619,39.96541]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105754075","mp_crag_id":"107747923","climb_id":"aWY9Or2ZWoyg8np4CeAIxA==","areaRef":"C/B+rdhpVX2kgTwub1cN/w=="},"content":{"description":"Though technically not on the East Ridge itself this route is on a big, detached block just up from the toe of the East Ridge, right smack dab in the middle of the Fern Canyon Trail.\n\nAs such, you may want to consider avoiding this route on weekends -- both for your own sanity and out of courtesy to the scores of hikers that use the trail to access Bear Peak.\n\nSuperfresh is about a third of the way up to the saddle at the top of Fern Canyon and is the obvious, well-chalked double-overhanging arete right on one of the steepest sections of the trail.\n\nStart in the crack in the dihedral and stretch right to clip a bolt. Move out onto the face and clip a second bolt and away you go! Continuously powerful moves lead up the arete to the famous footless clip.
