This is best done after climbing the route, or from the North side. Duck through a hole formed by a short chimney capped by a chock-stone to get to the South face.\n\nA few meters east of this there is a large pine growing near the Wall, with a right-leaning crack starting near it.

This fin forms a right-facing dihedral. The route climbs up the East face slabs slightly left and turns right under the fin and follows the dihedral.\n\nP-1 Start at the low point of the rock or slightly North of it. Work your way up and left on somewhat unprotected rock. I placed 3 pieces for the whole pitch. The climbing is easy but punctuated by some 5.4 moves. Once under the fin move right and enter the dihedral. About half way up set up a belay at a stump/bush\n\nP-2 Exit the dihedral to the South via one of two weaknesses. The lower weakness provides an easier exit but puts you on a steep 5.7 slab with no pro for about 15-20 feet. The upper weakness is harder to surmount (5.6) but puts you on easier terrain. Once on the slab work you way up towards a 2 foot wide crack and reach the summit after exiting left from the crack. Belay some 15 feet shy of the summit at a horizontal crack (no pro at the summit)\n\nDescent - Retrace you steps North (right) on the horizontal crack until you reach a broken area and exit West. scramble down 30 feet of fourth class to the West side of the Tiny Tower - Climb the West ridge for a complete outing.","protection":"Standard Flatiron rack.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,ee2fde9f-b2c2-58e8-ad07-ff56ccf69c8a,02c5215a-04f5-5e02-b543-01168550ce2c","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","South","Tiny Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.2"},{"count":2,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.289,39.9611]},"bbox":[-105.28958665560106,39.96065033981814,-105.28841334439892,39.961549660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745819","area_id":"AsUhWgT1XgK1QwEWhVDOLA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:55.092Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:37.430Z"}
