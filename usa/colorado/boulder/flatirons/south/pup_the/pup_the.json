Start in the center of the East face. Follow a hand crack past a large tree until it finishes. Hop left into an off-width crack, skip up this until it ends, then jump up the remaining slab on in-cut jugs. To descend, either scramble off north, downclimb the route, or loop your rope around one of the large smooth protrusions of rock and make a single rappel in any direction.","protection":"Standard Flatiron rack.
