Climb anywhere. It looks like the right side has a little bit cleaner rock.\n\nThe top of the slab has a bunch of large jumbled blocks that form big caves and confusing terrain. You can easily escape right from pretty much anywhere and hike up around the top back to the trail behind The Keel, but there is a faster way off: head left at the top of the slab. It looks like you are cliffed out to the south, but there is a small corner to stem down. This puts you very close to the back of The Keel. Hike down to the south of The Keel."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,ee2fde9f-b2c2-58e8-ad07-ff56ccf69c8a,f7845e63-4ceb-5949-8bf0-34b832c61e3f","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","South","Rudder, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29014,39.95865]},"bbox":[-105.29072663458192,39.958200339818134,-105.28955336541807,39.95909966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112248916","area_id":"94ReY0zrWUmL8DS4MsYePw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:55.096Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:26.060Z"}
