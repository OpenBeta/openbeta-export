If you're climbing at Overhang Rock or other routes at Poot Ridge, this would be worth the side excursion. The route by itself is NOT worth the approach.\n\nFrom the large boulder behind the summit where Stoned Operation is located, gain the ridge on its northern end. This can also be approached from the east via a pine needle covered slab. Once on the ridge, enjoy a surprisingly sharp knife edge ridge to the top.\n\nDownclimb the route or rappel 40 feet to the west off a webbing anchor.","protection":"A small, select Flatiron rack.
