We started on the left and aimed for the giant \"diving board\". You could stop here for your first pitch. We simulclimbed about 350' until the big tree ledge 2/3 of the way up, but there were places you could belay.\n\nFrom this big ledge, you can stay near the left side of the face to reach a small false summit and then do a short downclimb to another big ledge. Or you can just skirt this block on the right to reach the ledge. The Haas and Roach guidebooks show the final pitch going up the crack that splits the final summit tower. I'm not sure how that is, because we climbed a fun crack through an overhang on the right edge of the summit towers. We topped out on the right side of the chimney that splits the top and stepped across to the left to reach the top. You have to reverse these moves to get down, and there is no gear.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":"There is a nice staging area a little uphill to the left of the low point of the face. Gerry Roach's guidebook has a topo that shows the start further right, but it looked hard and obviously unprotected."},"__v":0},{"_id":"l2hcT6X9WUiw1h0AeR1GGg==","name":"Central East Face","yds":"Easy 5th","grades":{"yds":"Easy 5th","french":"1+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28596,39.95186]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"121558181","mp_crag_id":"113430701","climb_id":"l2hcT6X9WUiw1h0AeR1GGg==","areaRef":"G59QT05KUl2h77207O8MhA=="},"content":{"description":"This face/route doesn't seem to be documented in any of the guidebooks. It climbs the middle of the central face of the Forgotten Flatiron on a bucket covered face. You can climb almost anywhere you want. It is a 4th Class/easy 5th Class solo dream. The only disappointment was that it wasn't longer. At the top, it goes up a small finger of rock formed by a gully on either side. One can easily walk off from the top or bail into either of the gullies. I then returned to the bottom via the gully between The Forgotten Flatiron and the Fatiron. I found the \"crux\" to be the first 5-10 feet off the ground where a few friction moves were required before the massive buckets begin.","protection":"There isn't much in the way of cracks for gear, but there are loads of pockets, buckets, and elephant ears. Walk off the top.","location":"Walk north along the east face passing the section that has the highest summit on formation. The bucket covered face can't be missed, and the start is document in Mark Roth's photo. There is smoother red face to the north (right) of this face. The top of the route forms a small finger that sits between the tall south summit and the shorter north summit.\n\nI started from these GPS coordinates: 39.95183 N, -105.28537 W."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,ee2fde9f-b2c2-58e8-ad07-ff56ccf69c8a,1b9f504f-4e4a-525d-a1ef-bdb4ecef0c84","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","South","Forgotten Flatiron aka Icarus"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"},{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28596,39.95186]},"bbox":[-105.2865465763424,39.951410339818146,-105.2853734236576,39.952309660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113430701","area_id":"G59QT05KUl2h77207O8MhA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.2865465763424,39.951410339818146],[-105.2853734236576,39.951410339818146],[-105.2853734236576,39.952309660181875],[-105.2865465763424,39.952309660181875],[-105.2865465763424,39.951410339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:55.103Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:46.381Z"}
