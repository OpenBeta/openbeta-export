There is potential for 9 pitch slab routes in a close but remote feeling location.  These 5 wings are just south of Bear Peak, near the summit ridge, facing East.  They are probably most angelic when dusted with powder.\n\nApproach as if headed to Shadow Canyon area.  We parked at the new Mesa Trailhead about a mile outside of Eldorado Springs on CO Hwy 170.  Hike up South Mesa trail to Big Bluestem, head North, pass the Maiden, then bushwhack uphill.  It is perhaps 2500 feet elevation gain.  There is an old dilapidated structure along the way.\n\nP1.

It is a good route with solid stone. The route starts from the point of rock ~20 meters due west (nearest to) of the summit of The Keel and rises up and left on a distinct leaning crack system. After a few hundred feet this system gets clogged with shrubs and dirt, at which point you go just right (North) onto the next face over and continue to climb up and left on that face. This is repeated until you reach the summit ridge- which is followed past some false summits to the true summit, perhaps 800' of climbing in all.\n\nThe true summit has a large boulder marking it, just to the West, with a towering and steep North face. To escape, down-climb to a notch and scramble west to this tower.  To go back to the trail, go North down to a talus field, E/SE between the Wings and the Rudder, then back up W/SW between the Keel and the Wings, then down from there, South of the Keel toward the Sphinx on its North side, then East to the Mesa Trail.\n\nThese directions should not be taken lightly or capriciously unless you wish to end up in the narrow slot to the North, between the Keel and the South Shanahan Rocks... with the company of a mother bear and her cubs.\n\nNote that there is no Eastward path down on the South side of the Wings- They are \"cliffed out.\"\n\nEds. this appears to be the 5th wing counting from the left.","protection":"Although we soloed this route, I did make note that it appeared a standard Flatirons rack (cams and nuts with long slings) could protect the route as well as similar east face routes.","location":"Start in a left-leaning crack that ascends up the center of the North Wing, just behind the summit of The Keel."},"__v":0},{"_id":"qq0IO/DlUh2g4xVT+5EvzQ==","name":"The Middle Wing (4th Wing)","yds":"5.3","grades":{"yds":"5.3","french":"3+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2911,39.9564]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"106737589","mp_crag_id":"105745768","climb_id":"qq0IO/DlUh2g4xVT+5EvzQ==","areaRef":"3H8ULMxEUuazbA5BdszPZw=="},"content":{"description":"This is a superb route on high quality rock in an outstanding location. The rock is similar to that of the 3rd Flatiron, though much less travelled.\n\nThere seem to be many approach routes, none of which are particularly quick. One way is to first climb '\n\nThe Keel\n\n' (1000 feet 4th class), then contour approximately 300 feet South from the summit of\n\nThe Keel\n\nto reach a distinctly separate rock from 'The North Wing'.\n\nAlternatively, scramble up the talus field which runs parallel to The Keel on the southern side. Follow this to it's end and bushwhack 50 feet west to reach the base of the route. Approach time: 1 hour 30 minutes.\n\nTiptoe up the slab on perfect rock for 700 feet to the summit, passing some interesting rock architecture on the way. Smoother, better quality rock is found to the right, and tree belays are found to the left.\n\nThe ideal descent would be to go up and over into Shadow Canyon and follow the main trail down. However, during raptor closures (Feb 1st- July 31st) it could be frowned upon to do this. An alternative is to head North from the summit for approximately 1000 feet then East down tricky ground to emerge in amongst the Shanahan Crags and then on to the Mesa Trail, being careful not to disturb too many bears on the way down.

The rock up there is surprisingly interesting though, and the exposure as well as the view make this a great adventure whether you free climb it or aid it.\n\nP1.\n\nLow 5th Class. Rope up on the ridge when things start to turn to 5th Class. Head over to the ledge below the obvious offwidth, and build a belay. If you don't have a 70m or you rope up a bit early, you may have to do this as two pitches.\n\nP2.\n\nC1+ (probably 5.10+ free). From the ledge, head up a finger crack that quickly widens to hands and then to offwidth. The crack continues to flare out to about 12 inches and forces you around a roof (you could probably tunnel). From here, some stemming up a triangular area brings you to easier ground and a belay.\n\nP3.\n\nLow 5th Class. Do a traverse pitch across the slab over to the next crack. There are two cracks on the upper part of the overhang, but only the right one makes it to the ground. Head over that way, and belay at the big tree below it.\n\nP4.\n\nC1. (probably 5.9 free). Climb up the short crack using horizontal cracks on the sides. A very flared crack guards the ending, but luckily there are face holds.
