It is also closed from Feb 1 to July 31 due to raptor nesting.  The protection on the first pitch consists of three bolts with nuts only (no hangars) and a few stopper, RP, or tiny cam placements on the upper half of the pitch.  I am not sure if the nuts on these bolts can be unscrewed, but if so, it would be great to put hangars on these bolts (or much better, replace them entirely).  [Replaced in 2014 - see comments.]\n\nThe route begins at the highest saddle west of the Matron, and follows the arete between the North face and SW Faces, except for deviating onto the SW face around an overhang at the crux.  It is better to approach via the North side of the Matron.\n\nClimb up the arete to the overhang, and clip the first bolt.  This area is a shameful \"bolt graveyard\", containing six(!) other bolts that have all been chopped.  Climb up the SW Face, traversing left to clip a second bolt.  Now move up and left back to the arete (also 5.8).\n\nThe rest of the first pitch is now much easier and follows the spectacular arete to the rappel anchor at 80'.  There is one more hangarless bolt in this section, as well as a few places for stoppers or small cams.  This first pitch is easily toproped from this anchor, if you are coming down from climbing another route on the Matron.\n\nThe second pitch to the summit is easier (about 5.6) and offers excellent protection through the crux.  Move left and up through a broken area to an eye bolt 130' off the ground, then move up and left and skirt the summit overhang to the right.  This area can also be reached by stepping right off the belay and heading straight up some easy cracks.  Clip 4 ancient pins as you skirt the overhang (crux).

Climb down this ramp, which is quite easy, but there are pine needles and loose rock around, and a fall would be fatal, so it is a good idea to be roped up.  This is the most unpleasant pitch of the route.  It is also possible to begin right from the base of the west face, but this is more difficult and involves more loose and crumbly rock.\n\nFrom here the route is obvious, you simply follow this ramp east as it goes down and then back up.  There are several nice belays along the middle of this ledge, where it is 6' wide.\n\nEventually, as the ramp heads up, it shrinks down and steepens.  Here you will find several fixed pins.  Finally, the ledge runs out together, and the crux of the route is the remaining 10 feet or so to the East Ridge.  There is an old bolt here to clip before the crux (traverse right from the bolt if you want to make it 5.6, straight up is harder).\n\nOnce you reach the east ridge, you will probably be experiencing major rope drag.  The easiest option is to continue traversing until you reach a belay stance.  You can also immediately head up the east ridge, in which case you will discover a foot wide chimney separates you from the rest of the east face.

The route is similarly long, steep and wild. Were it on better rock the route would be a classic, but it isn't. 3-star moves and position around some poor quality rock in several places.\n\nThis climb starts as for \"Quiche On A Leash\" on the shady N. face of the Maiden. Reach the N. Face via a trail below (to the east) of the rock and head uphill on the North side until a massive, left-leaning, overhanging, broken dihedral is seen. Perhaps 20' up the route there is a ledge to the left and a 10' length of purple webbing hanging down from a fixed pin, as if it were an extended draw to clip; its quality is very, very dubious. (it was already very dubious in 2003) The corner ascends to a needle's eye near the top of the wall, through that and to an anchor/rap station up and left of the top of the route. This is all perhaps 200' from the lowest/East-most edge of the N. Face, or 100' East/below the Standard N. Face route.\n\nQuiche On A Leash goes up the initial dihedral to reach the ledge, passing a 10b layback move with slick feet. From this ledge the ORIGINAL climb (QOAL) walks out left and face climbs back to the dihedral and then up and on, all the way left to the tree below the needle's eye. Refer to Rossiter's Flatirons climbing book.\n\nRather than do this, place a TCU in a diagonal seam in the left-side wall at waist level (even with the purple webbing's end) and start heading up and right, into the right-most corner, not the left.\n\nRemain there, stemming back and powering up though an initial bulge to reach the right side of the large dihedral. There is a little bad rock in this section, although none of the moves require using it for holds. Continue up to where the pin is anchored and place some good small-med stoppers, then continue up the right most of the twin corners, going through bulge after bulge, trending left with each one as the corner goes that way. There are at least four 5.10 or harder cruxes. Many of the moves were done in a horizontal body position on our ascent. The hardest crux (10d?, tricky & powerful) was protected by the two smallest HB cams I had, a #0 and #00 HB micromate- similar to the smallest 2 Metolius or Alien cams. Later, as teh corners converge you will reach a 1/4\"-driven angle and some fixed hardware above that might be the worst I've ever seen, Circa 1950s.  No doubt this was an old aid line, but modern climbing gear can back it up. I presume this to have been the first FREE ascent of the right hand side of the line.\n\nThe grade is 'old school' and may not compare to other recently developed routes. Our ascent felt a little harder, but that was likely due to cleaning and testing suspect rock on the lead, even in the middle of the cruxes.

It is an interesting diversion at the Matron but not a destination. There are some really good moves on some pretty poor rock in at least one spot. I scraped off a lot of grit and lichen, and my partner broke off one hand hold. Were the route on better stone, it would be a 2+ star route. As it is, it is a 2- star.\n\nThis climb starts on the high end of the North Face, just a short distance East of the West Face and the slab routes there. Soul Survivor boulders up a flake to an initial bolt, goes up and right (reachy) to a big undercling flake, then through the roof left (11b, reachy) or right to underclings and a heel hook (11d, gut-buster). The rock on chalked flake of the right option is crumbly, and grit was falling out of the heel hooks I used. The left way is a \"will my foot really stick to that?\" move with a hidden jug to match hands on at the lip.\n\nGet to the first bolt (5.9-) to the roof (5.10b) through the roof (11b) and then go up and left to gain a crack which goes up and right (runout of 1-1.5\" gear, 5.8) to the 3rd bolt. From the 3rd bolt climb 5.10 and 5.11- moves to the top of the buttress (lichens, crumbing rock in a few places) where you can clip 2 eye-bolts on the top, just at the W. Face intersection. Long slings make a smooth TR possible. If not using slings, save your rope and the bolts, and rap, don't lower off.","protection":"6 draws + a set for the top anchors.  1-1.5\" pro with a sling can protect the long distance (relatively easy, maybe 5.8) between the second bolt and the third.

Approach the Matron and walk to the very most Easterly of the base. From here, climb one pitch of 5.5 up a ramp that angles from right to left. The pitch is the only semi-difficult one on the route and is very short, about 30 feet. From here, scramble up easy, fun slabs for about 350 feet to the summit.\n\nTo descend, rap off double bolt anchors over the back side.\n\nPer\n\nKevin X\n\n: once you're off the summit, there are two sets of anchors - one to the west (your left while rapping), one to the east, (your right while rapping). With a 60m, go to the anchor to the west, and rap down the slab to the ground. The eastern anchor will not allow you to reach the ground. I am unsure if a 70m would reach the ground from the eastern set.","protection":"This route is typical of many other Flatiron face climbs in that it takes very little pro, but is not really scary.

At around 90 feet, he made a 15-20-foot hand traverse to the right before finishing straight up a short, shallow, left-facing dihedral-ish feature and pulling onto a ledge (crux, 5.9+).
