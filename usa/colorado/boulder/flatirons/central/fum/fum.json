We climbed it with a 60m rope and were able to complete the climb in two pitches the first one being a full 60m.\n\nIf climbing with a shorter ropem you may simul-climb or belay at the flake described below (not that good of a belay though)\n\nStart at the low point of the rock just right of the gully that separates Fo from Fum.\n\nP1. Climb a left-leaning, shallow, hand crack that disappears after some 50 feet. This section protect with a couple of small and mid-sized cams. Once the crack disappears, continue up and left towards the East Face Southern arete. You will be able to protect on a flake where the South face meets the East face. This will be your last pro for the next 140 feet. Move back onto the East face and climb straight up the face. This is 5.5 Flatiron face climbing at its best. Aim for the trees on a large ledge that runs across the entire face and belay where you can.\n\nP2. From the ledge, look for a weakness on the head wall on the left side (South) of the ledge, and crank up a 5.6 short section followed by some 30 easy feet to the summit. This section is well protected.\n\nDescent: Scramble down to the Northwest, and find a crack system. The descent in this system is easy but for some 5.3 moves near the bottom. When we climbed it, someone had leaned a dead tree against the wall making this much easier.","protection":"Standard Flatiron rack.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Lnjwjx04WC2FGteq7i7qkA==","name":"East Face Right/Fum","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2914,39.9745]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105757225","mp_crag_id":"105745519","climb_id":"Lnjwjx04WC2FGteq7i7qkA==","areaRef":"aiYqkaDmXfWr2v3NIAVN1Q=="},"content":{"description":"This is a scruffy route that starts at the low point on the rock on the East face.

This tree ia not on the face and is hard to use as pro. This section is run out and thin. Once on the right side of the East face climb up and slightly left towards other trees on the face. Belay at either tree when you run the rope out. The lower tree has ants in it...\n\nP-2 - Climb onto the now treeless east face past a crack offering the last pro for a while. Traverse left under a blank wall and into a chimney via a funky move above a small tree. Run up to the summit.\n\nDescent - Scramble down to the West via a crack and a dead tree.
