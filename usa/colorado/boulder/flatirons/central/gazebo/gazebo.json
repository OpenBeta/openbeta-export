The easiest and shortest way up is probably the North edge of the east face, but we came up from the meadow to the south. The south side provides lots of possibilities. You could get on the south ridge early and extend your journey a couple hundred feet, or you can walk up the gully all the way to the final 60 foot head wall. The easiest route up this last section is to walk left to the arÃªte and follow a left-facing corner until it runs out. This corner has great protection if you actually bring a rope. When it ends step right onto the east face for a short scramble to the top.\n\nOther options are the obvious wide crack/groove behind a tree. Gaining this groove feels harder than 4th class. It's a couple 5.5 moves while the tree is kind of spotting you.\n\nA few other spots along this ledge have slightly harder but fun ways to tackle the bulge onto the summit slab.","protection":"A small rack or just solo.  There is an old 1/4 inch bolt up top, but I wouldn't trust it for much.","location":"When you pass under the East Gazebo, which touches the Mallory Cave trail, hang a right and wander up through the meadow.

Several options will present themselves, but one stands out near the tallest point of the rock.
