This route [may be] closed Feb 1 to Aug 1.\n\nThis route is on the right side of the northeast face, it reaches the summit ridge just south of the summit near a large pine tree.  The route follows a crack/corner system that drops straight down from this pine tree.  Start the route quite high up, only 150' or so below the saddle north of Bear Creek Spire, and traverse south (left) into the crack system.  If you start lower down you will encounter 5.6 climbing.\n\nThe climb now consists of sections of dirt and trees alternating with friable rock covered by pine needles.  The crux is a section of small roofs, consider carefully how you are going to downclimb this while going up.  After you reach the big tree and ridge, there are still a few exciting exposed moves to reach the summit.  I would have rated this route 5.4, but probably it was all the friable rock and dirt that was freaking me out.\n\nDownclimb the route (or if you were smart and brought a rope, rappel the route from trees).","protection":"Standard rack with long slings for trees.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"ceIH9FrrUgukgZHAWUVU0Q==","name":"North Face","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2868,39.9726]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105847243","mp_crag_id":"105745861","climb_id":"ceIH9FrrUgukgZHAWUVU0Q==","areaRef":"5Sl1q8LTULSeUW7DoZrTDg=="},"content":{"description":"Bear Creek Spire also has a North Face route, accessible from the West side of the saddle above BCS and below the East Bone of Dinosaur Rock.
