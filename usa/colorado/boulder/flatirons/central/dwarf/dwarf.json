It is located on the shady N face of the Dwarf.  Sadly, this was formerly a sport climb that received the chop (for whatever reason) but now is best done as a TR.\n\nAscend the gully SW from the SW corner of Der Zerkle off the Mallory Cave Trail.  If you reached Back in Slacks/Power Bulge, you've gone too far.  Beware of poison ivy.\n\nYou can easily scramble up the W side of this rock and set up the TR.\n\nThis little problem packs a punch for virtually every move.  Move in from the R on a traverse.  Keep your feet low.  Use body tension, side pulls, angled underclings, and pebble pinches to traverse all of perhaps 8 feet.  Then, work up using good foot technique on slightly overhanging rock to gain a horn of sorts.  A few holds on the L side of this horn help you to gain the top.  Quite a punch.  Onsight this one and you're a solid 5.11 climber.  Not me.","protection":"There are at least 3 remnants of bolts left in the rock.  There appears to be a hole low.  There are 2 ring bolts on top.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,3064068f-8414-58a3-aefa-818bbb244841,b484f8a2-6e0a-5a7b-b3df-e1c4f83d4030","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","Central","Dwarf"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29,39.9777]},"bbox":[-105.29058679808432,39.977250339818134,-105.28941320191566,39.97814966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746069","area_id":"tIT4om4KWnuz3+HE+D1AMA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:00.898Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:35.002Z"}
