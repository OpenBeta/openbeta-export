It's probably been done before but it's not in R Rossiter's Boulder Climbs North or Flatirons guidebooks.  Gave it a name because unknown crack sounded boring.  It can serve as a way to get a TR on Cold Sweat, a way to get the blood flowing, or just a pleasant, if brief, romp.\n\nFind this on the WSW face of The Bubble, which lies just W of N Dinosaur Egg.  Approach via NCAR to the Mesa Trail, S to Bear Canyon Trail, up (N) the gully between the 2nd and 3rd strata.  If you back up from N Dinosaur Egg to examine the route Cloud Walker, you'll back right into the E face of The Bubble.\n\nA combination of jams and large face holds allow this slightly-overhanging, R-leaning crack to go at a moderate grade.  Tape is not necessary.  There is a 10-15 ft traverse R to the anchors of Cold Sweat (2 cold shuts) as the crack peters out.  Rap the route.  35 ft.\n\nIt is probably equivalent in difficulty to Mr. Natural in Eldo, which is 5.8+, but it's slightly steeper.","protection":"#2F to #4 Camalots useful.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"dy0PP5hSWt24Vsf/kJJPQA==","name":"Hot Spit","yds":"5.11c","grades":{"yds":"5.11c","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Paul Piana and Eric Johnson, 1987","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2888,39.9726]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105761640","mp_crag_id":"105746551","climb_id":"dy0PP5hSWt24Vsf/kJJPQA==","areaRef":"eN9ma8i8UZ+/jK25bBFi1w=="},"content":{"description":"Although short with only three bolts, Hot Spit is a hidden gem in the Flatirons.

Visiting Hot Spit is a great way to finish off a day of climbing at the nearby Overhang Wall or in the Dinosaur Mountain area.   Hot Spit is located on the west side of the Bubble.

OK, this may be boring perhaps, but the sidepulls vary. Taping your left Achilles and left 3rd & 4th fingers may be useful. This route climbs steeper than it looks. The crux is after the 3rd bolt involving small holds for liebacks. A stick clip is facile and perhaps useful. The 3rd piece of protection is a drilled angle, reminiscent of Garden of the Gods or the desert. It seems solid. The anchors are a pair of coldshuts. The rock is rough and fluffs up the rope when weighted on TR. Rap the route.
