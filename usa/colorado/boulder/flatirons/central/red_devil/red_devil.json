Face of the Red Devil that people can enjoy on TR from the\n\nHIAB\n\nanchors. I grade the route at 10+, but I also believe that it is slightly harder than\n\nHell In A Bucket\n\n, which I believe to be about 10c.\n\nTo start the route, go about 6 meters left (uphill) of the start of\n\nHell In A Bucket\n\n.

Instead, stay left through a second bulge, again on sidepulls, pinches, and pockets, staying about 2 meters left of bolts 6 & 7 (the bolts for this lie would be 3 meters away). There is a bit of flakey lichen here, but the holds are solid & clean.
