Start standing under the trail on a left hand, weird sloper and right hand undercling or sidepull. Pull on with difficulty, and with some awkward feet, punch 4 feet to a perfect pair of comfy edges, the right hand being better. Some do this move with 1 hand, some with 2, either way it’s hard, and avoiding a dab can be problematic. The second move is either another massive dyno to a left sloper jug which is said to be easier than the first, but it felt much harder. It’s a style thing I guess. It’s possible to work around right then back left using some horrible holds, which avoids the dyno but isn’t any easier. Top out carefully. Satisfying movement and a few sweet moves make this a perfect choice for the V12 power climber.","protection":"2-4 pads.","location":"Once at Dinosaur Rock, continue up the Mallory Cave Trail.

Stacking some pads helps. Start with your right hand on a thin sidepull and your left hand on a pinch on the arete. To get my feet high enough to start climbing, I pushed off of the boulder that is underneath and to the left; this allows me to get my right foot smeared onto the actual problem. Once on, I release the left foot and begin.\n\nThe first move is the hardest, you have to pretty accurately grab a thin/sharp crimp with your right hand. The rest of the moves aren't too bad, but the last move requires some confidence. Your position feels a bit airy, so having a spotter and some pads would be wise. To finish, after matching the jug crack, I climbed onto the boulder to the left and continued till I was able to downclimb, which I thought was fun.\n\nI am not sure about the grade, as I'm the only one to have climbed it, but I'd imagine it's between V4-6.
