At the top, step down onto a couple of boulders, and scramble to the ground. It is best to exit left on the existing Der Zerkle approach trail and go back down to the Mallory Cave Trail.\n\nLike Babyhorn downhill from this, it may be a good short climb for kids. As I remember, the tree on the back should provide anchor options.","protection":"None.","location":"This route is visible from the Mallory Cave Trail through an opening in the trees."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,3064068f-8414-58a3-aefa-818bbb244841,37a20dfb-0af5-5be9-a6af-e7ea17ca07d4","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","Central","Mini Zerk"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28764,39.97426]},"bbox":[-105.28822676854793,39.97381033981814,-105.28705323145206,39.974709660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116575110","area_id":"N6IN+wr1W+mmr+fqF8oH1A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.28822676854793,39.97381033981814],[-105.28705323145206,39.97381033981814],[-105.28705323145206,39.974709660181865],[-105.28822676854793,39.974709660181865],[-105.28822676854793,39.97381033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:00.350Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:24.073Z"}
