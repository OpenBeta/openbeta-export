Start at the left side of the east face and head straight up a left-facing dihedral that forms one side of a shallow gully.  Cross over the gully when the pro gets thin and head up the face to a belay stance about 25 feet below the south facing arete that goes to the summit.  Tackle the arete, cross a crevice, move out onto the east face and head for the summit.\n\nVariation: from the crevice, head west and corkscrew around the summit block via some cramped moves under an overhang on the west reminiscent of\n\nCozyhang\n\non The Dome.\n\nDescent: scramble to the northernmost point on the summit and head west to a gully that leads to top of the saddle between Fo amd Fum.  From the summit, it looks like a steep downclimb, but it's not.  Cross the gully and head up the west side of Fum and through a hole behind Fum's west face.  Hike down along the north side of Fum.  You can also descend the gully between Fo and Fum, but it supposedly requires some 5.4 downclimbing.","protection":"A standard rack--some extra big pieces (#4 Camalot, #11 Hex).

Wander up the Mallory Cave trail past Red Devil, the Box, angle SW, and head to the third strata of Dinosaur Mt.  This lies just L of the relatively-narrow channel/groove capped with a large chockstone between Fo & Fum.  Probably not heavily traveled but worth the effort for those in search of a brief (240') flatiron explore.  Start approximately 30 feet from the R edge of Fum in a shallow, inviting, L-angling groove with good face holds.\n\nP1.  Angle slightly L up this shallow groove.  Find a crux about 90' up as you hop up past an angled ledge.  Now head up.  Continue to a tree at 120' for a belay (optional).\n\nP2.  Continue up to a second crux with double sidepulls and good smearing as you shuffle up.  This is somewhat reminiscent of the South Platte here.  Move slightly R and then continue to the top on easier terrain.  Hopefully you'll find a pleasant breeze at the summit.\n\nDescend via a 50' downclimb with a few 4th or low 5th class moves to the slot between Fo & Fum (the next flatiron N).  Move N up over a boulder and head for a hole/cave to the Fum-Dum col.
