Between the top of the Lower tower and the bottom of the upper tower is a fern, raspberry and thimbleberry filled gully with a bit of a trail. You will pass a set of twin cracks, 8' off of the ground (In Focus, 5.10) and then a single hanging crack 4 meters further left (Picture Man Crack, 5.7).  These are seen in the attached picture. Just another 3 meters up and left is a huecoed out, shallow crack with the first pocket in the bottom of the crack at about 8' high. The crack runs for 6 feet before it ends abruptly, with a short move or two of fingercrack still higher. There is a rounded boulder just left of the start of this line, pinched in between the ground and the back of this flatiron.\n\nClimb up (boulder) on a little slashed pocket for the left and  a pebble crimp for the right and some sloping feet to reach the first little pocket.  For the FA this sequence was the crux at 5.10. The boulder to the left was not used simply for lack of having seen it that way (there were nasty bushes over it) and then up and over through some slabs and an easy wall above. This is well done as a boulder problem.\n\nAfter the first Ascent with a scrambling group nearby, Stephan G. did the second ascent as a flash free-solo. He found that stepping back onto the aforementioned round boulder brought the opening sequence from 5.10 to 5.9. So this route goes 5.9 without wandering. The bushes (thimbleberry) over it were fairly easily and non-destructively trained out of the way when I repeated the route and used the boulder.
