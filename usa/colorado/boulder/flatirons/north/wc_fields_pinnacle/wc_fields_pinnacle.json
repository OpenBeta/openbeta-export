This route can likely be done in one pitch, but the zig-zagging would give nasty drag (unless using double ropes, or skip clipping the belay bolt).  All bolts on this route are bomber 3/8\", probably not the originals.\n\nBegin at a tree on the north side of the east face which is north of a two foot overhang on the lower east face.  P1: Climb this easy slab to where it steepens (pin), then move right over a steep overlap to a belay bolt near the north end of the face (100').\n\nP2: Move back left, then up to a bolt.  Above and to the left you can see another bolt about 15' higher (above an overlap).  You can place a #3 Camalot in a slot to your left, but it is not much higher than the first bolt.  The crux is the next few feet, moving up left of the bolt.  Then grab some good handholds and continue straight up to the second bolt.  Move up and right, place a red Alien (or equivalent) under an overlap, then lieback a flake up and right and run it out up an easy 20' slab to the razor-like summit ridge.\n\nThere is a 2 bolt rap anchor just on the other side of the edge.  Tag the summit and then rap 75' west to the ground.","protection":"A few draws and longer slings.  There are several trad placements, we placed a red alien and #2 and #3 Camalot, so bring 6 cams of various sizes to be safe.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,86410ac6-a2da-5a5f-8855-ba74384faafb,f0451e32-6483-5aa7-90a2-4760b96b9325","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","North","W.C.
