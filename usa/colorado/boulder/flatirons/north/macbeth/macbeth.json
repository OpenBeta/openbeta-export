IMO. it's a judgment call as to whether the extra hillside erosion is worth the extra 100 feet of \"rock\".\n\nThe main slab is 100-150 feet long. If you include all the minor slabs above and below the main rock, this route is maybe 300 feet, including hiking.\n\nDescent: walk/scramble off the main slab to the southwest.
