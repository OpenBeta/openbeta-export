This climb is approximately 300' long.  The bottom of the east face of the Spy is connected to the north edge of the First Flatironette.

Climb over the step either on the left (5.3) or right (slightly harder).\n\nNow follow the narrowing arete to the summit.  Very exposed and not much pro.  Since you are on a narrow fin, a fall by either leader or follower could result in a pendulum down either side, and it might be hard to return to the route.\n\nFrom the summit, continue west and pass an overhang by means of a jump.

There are a couple of other possible lines here, but the protection and rock quality on those are suspect.  This route is the most obvious weakness to the right of the big tree and the bird poop stains....  Named for one of the most famous spies of all time, I was really hoping 007 would be 5.7, and luckily enough that feels about right.  This has most likely been climbed before, if not, it should get climbed some more....  The middle section has some awkward moves and a little suspect rock, but if you have a rope, there is tons of good gear.  When you approach the lip, the rock quality is as good as anywhere in the Flatirons, and you won't want it to end.  The crack gains the\n\nEast Ridge\n\nright before its crux bulge.
