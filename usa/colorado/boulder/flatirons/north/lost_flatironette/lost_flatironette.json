The start is slightly lichenous and dirty, being down in the trees and lacking light or wind to clean it up, but this presents little problem.\n\nMore disconcerting, and perhaps what most people will recall about the route if anything stands out, would be the brief section of poor rock that lies perhaps 50' from the top.  The light spot at a short overlap is shedding grains and has no real holds left but for what seemed a reasonable slanted edge to the right of the arete for a foothold.  Once up on this, solid stone and cobbles to the right provide quick relief from any anxiety.  A fall from there would likely be tragic if you are soloing the route, as the small sloping ledge below does not provide the sort of stance one can fall onto and remain.","protection":"Since I have not roped up for this pitch, I remain uncertain.  Take a light Flatirons rack, and be aware that much of the route will not be well protected.","location":"This route climbs the rock from the low point at the base up to the SE ridge (climber's right) and to the summit.  Were it not for a few feet of poor stone along the way, I would review the route as 2 stars.  Perhaps normal traffic and cleaning will fix that problem."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,86410ac6-a2da-5a5f-8855-ba74384faafb,af6d5b57-b716-5f70-b69b-391826003b6d","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","North","Lost Flatironette"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.3"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2922,39.98348]},"bbox":[-105.29278684772376,39.983030339818136,-105.29161315227623,39.983929660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109794459","area_id":"r21bV7cWX3C2mzkYJgA7bQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.29278684772376,39.983030339818136],[-105.29161315227623,39.983030339818136],[-105.29161315227623,39.983929660181865],[-105.29278684772376,39.983929660181865],[-105.29278684772376,39.983030339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:00.914Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:54.751Z"}
