After some 30-50 feet place your last piece for a while and traverse left unto the East face. Delicate face climbing among the lichen will put put you on a broken ledge. Traverse left and up and belay at a small tree with a nice hand crack on the back.\n\nP2 - Traverse left and up to a large narrowing slot and move up to the top of the ridge. Run up the ridge.\n\nFrom here, the top of the ridge is broken and undefined. You can unrope and follow it to a pinpoint summit after a bit of hiking. You can hike South from here to reach the Amphitheater or Saddle Rock trail.","protection":"Standard Flatiron rack, up to #3 Camalot.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,86410ac6-a2da-5a5f-8855-ba74384faafb,b7a43180-203b-51a8-b5a7-73d72b9357b3,382b4d00-ba6c-5ddb-a957-eeb86f7c97a3","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","North","Gregory Canyon (including The Amphitheatre)","Gregory Flatironette aka Fifth Pinnacle"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29529,39.99474]},"bbox":[-105.29587694446751,39.994290339818136,-105.29470305553248,39.99518966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745843","area_id":"OCtNALpsXdupV+64b3yXow==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.29587694446751,39.994290339818136],[-105.29470305553248,39.994290339818136],[-105.29470305553248,39.99518966018186],[-105.29587694446751,39.99518966018186],[-105.29587694446751,39.994290339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:02.653Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:27.489Z"}
