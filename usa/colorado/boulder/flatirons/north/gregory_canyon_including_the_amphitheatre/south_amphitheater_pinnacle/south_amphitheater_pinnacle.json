About 3 meters left of the\n\nSouth Ridge\n\n, there is a steel, flat face of rock.  If you back up, you can see where this vertical-to-overhung face will go up a narrow, flat rib to a false summit.  Face climb just left of a shallow, junky corner to get off the ground and continue up on in-cuts and jugs on vertical terrain to a slightly overhanging face finish on large in-cut holds.  This is the best climbing I found on this formation.","protection":"?? - A few pieces here and there, perhaps.

You can cheat and use the left side, or make it more challenging and stay more on the right.\n\nThe rock sucks here. However, there is a line of fairly solid rock if you follow it the right way.","protection":"Some long slings/cord for the anchor.","location":"Climb up the southwest corner of this ridge and scale across to get to the two trees that are the TR anchors.
