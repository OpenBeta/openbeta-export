Clip pin after pin, and place gear as you like while climbing the overhanging system, which is steeper and harder than it looks from below (looks 5.7-ish).

You'll encounter some very cool holds along this 90 feet of climbing: huecos, iron-rock flakes, tiny pockets, and the ubiquituous Flatirons crimpers.

From the sloper (under the crimpy V and ear of the V7), climb or dyno into the cave, and continue to the gap on the huecos. This path often does not have chalk.\n\nFinal third//V7 and V8: stay low, and use the crimps on the bulge for your hands or heelhooks. Reach the large hueco, and try to fit your body inside. Option 1: pulling out of the large hueco, use holds below the lip for another ten feet or so, then surf the lip to the end and mantel. This is slightly easier but more sensible than option 2. Option 2: stay low all the way to the tree. There are holds.

This feels exposed, and you're now doing the splits. From here if you are tall, you can reach an awesome jug pocket on the top the Pullman Car, but it is hidden, you will have to feel around for it and reach really far. If you can't find it or aren't tall enough, this move may be a little harder, but it is certainly still possible. From here, it is about 150 feet of easy climbing to the summit.\n\nOverall, the route isn't difficult if you know the beta, but I would recommend practicing it on top rope first if you have any doubts (rappel or downclimb from the true summit, and build anchor at top of the route), a fall could result in a >40 foot free fall onto the 45 degree Flatiron.

It was the first that I did unroped. I've climbed it more than any other route in the Flatirons. It used to hardly ever see traffic...no longer, you step off a trail onto the route, you step off the top of the route onto another trail, and the climbing is easy and sometimes unique. For all of these reasons, this route is one of my favorites in the Flatirons. Difficulty snobs will want to stay away.\n\nThis formation has become quite popular, and you should expect to share the route with others.\n\nThe approach to the 2nd is described on its Rock page. At the bottom of the 2nd, step off the trail and onto the rock. The first crux is negotiating a slight bulge with a crack. From there, the easiest way trends right a bit, then back left aiming for the gully. Follow the holds.... Step right onto the rib, and head for an obvious tree. Keep heading up and slightly right over easier rock. The obvious Pullman Car will be looming above you to the left. Soon, you will be on a small summit, with a notch between you and the rest of the route. Jump! It's not as hard as it looks.\n\nContinue trending up and right. You will intersect the north edge of the 2nd. The route finding crux of the route is here where you need to find the spot to step around onto to the north to reach the final slab up to the top of the route.
