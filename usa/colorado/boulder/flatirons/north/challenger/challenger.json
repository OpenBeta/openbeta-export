Consider combining this with a route on the Fourth Flatiron, Green Mountain Pinnacle or Willie B.  This is a great route to free solo if you are solid; there is very little pro in any case and even a roped fall would be serious.\n\nP1. Start in the saddle between Green Mountain Pinnacle and Challenger, and follow the East Face to the top of the Spaceship.  You can belay at a tree in the middle after crossing a smooth slab.\n\nP2. Above this, climb for the most part just left of the arete formed by the east and northeast faces (often you can use the arete as a handhold).  The position is spectacular and exposed, and the climbing is sustained.  There is a crack for pro 60' below the top, but after that you will have to run it out.  The hardest and most exposed moves are right below the summit.\n\nDrink in the summit view.  To descend, continue west along an arete until you reach a saddle where you can scramble down either side of the formation.","protection":"Light rack to 2\".","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,86410ac6-a2da-5a5f-8855-ba74384faafb,b8de7100-83a3-5f69-9edd-1ff769fa62e9","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","North","Challenger"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.295,39.98306]},"bbox":[-105.29558684411629,39.982610339818144,-105.29441315588373,39.983509660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745397","area_id":"uN5xAIOjX2me3R/3afpi6Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:02.655Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:37.168Z"}
