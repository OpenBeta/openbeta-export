As you pass the saddle continue down some 30-40 yards until a large Dihedral comes into view. This dihedral is a bit bushy and blocky.\n\nThe West face route climbs the left side of the broken dihedral for some 50 or feet, heading left towards a ledge below a vertical headwall that sits to the left of the dihedral. Climb the headwall via some burly moves for some 20ft and head up to intercept the North ridge some 40 feet North of the summit.\n\nDescent - Downclimb East and then South to the saddle between summits. Scramble West back to the trail. The are two gullies you can take for this downclimb.

To get there, hike to the rock and down its West side, past the NW arete and the North face. You are supposed to scramble up the NE face into a gully passing the word JERSEY written in 1 foot letters on their right in order to reach a small tree on a small ledge.\n\nWe were not able to find the start as described by Roach (as above). We started too far West, on the North face proper. We went up a scruffy, dirty, and insecure gully up to the tree on the left skyline. After reaching it, it was clear the correct start was further East (left)....\n\nOnce on the tree ledge the fun begins, climb the clean, nicely featured slab for some 50 feet while traverse slightly right. Eventually you will connect with the North ridge.
