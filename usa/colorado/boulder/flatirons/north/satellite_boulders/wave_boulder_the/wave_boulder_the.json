A good warm up or warm down on mostly small holds and every bit as good as the Tree Slab Traverse on Flagstaff.","protection":"maybe a spotter","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"p+vBakF5W7ezN1VOpKFLaw==","name":"Wave Overhang","yds":"V0","grades":{"yds":"V0","font":"4","vscale":"V0"},"fa":"???","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29047,39.98934]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"105757486","mp_crag_id":"111852425","climb_id":"p+vBakF5W7ezN1VOpKFLaw==","areaRef":"c3wtA6AGVueFu12WkAZLOg=="},"content":{"description":"Pass the Sputnik Boulder like you are going up to the main area for the Lower Satellites and the Third Flatiron.
