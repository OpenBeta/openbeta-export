Your Mother ascends the middle of the North face of the Mothership from a sds down in a slot. Using a good hand hold, use some small intermediates to get to a good slot. Grab the one edge on the slopey topout, and do a long reach move to another good edge. Use that to pull over and ascend the slab for 30 or so feet until you can downclimb the other side. Cool moves but too short.","protection":"a pad or two are nice","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"0eiFu5w7VxK6pjF4RjFFCw==","name":"Room With a View","yds":"V7-8","grades":{"yds":"V7-8","font":"7B","vscale":"V7-8"},"fa":"Jason Beausoleil, 2000","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29112,39.98916]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"106151846","mp_crag_id":"111852438","climb_id":"0eiFu5w7VxK6pjF4RjFFCw==","areaRef":"ZI5Plb+tWXaWLGyMEQAzJA=="},"content":{"description":"Pass the Sputnik Boulder like you are going up to the main area for the Lower Satellites and the Third Flatiron.

The Northeast Corner is the first thing you will come to and tops out around 16 feet. After a couple easy slab moves up the corner, you will encounter a long reach move to the slopey lip. Move around the corner a couple feet to the left to better hand holds, throw your right foot over the top and rock up and over. Fun as part of an easier circuit of problems, if you don't mind the air under your feet.","protection":"a pad or two are nice","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"MyBnaJrVWhuAqdh9+cJ9Kg==","name":"Mothership Overhang","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"Jason Beausoleil, 2000","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29112,39.98916]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"105759117","mp_crag_id":"111852438","climb_id":"MyBnaJrVWhuAqdh9+cJ9Kg==","areaRef":"ZI5Plb+tWXaWLGyMEQAzJA=="},"content":{"description":"Pass the Sputnik Boulder like you are going up to the main area for the Lower Satellites and the Third Flatiron.

Start on obvious holds at head height and, probably using a gaston, rock onto a slopey foothold that has a tendency to spit you off until you figure out how to hold the holds and what you are actually going to grab next.
