It is on the backside (East face) of the boulder that lies on the opposite side of the trail from the BBC.  The side that faces the trail has an obvious cave/roof problem on it.  The problem lies on the opposite side of that boulder.\n\nThe problem starts on two chalked crimps (undercling for the left hand).  Fire up to either a tough sloper or a big undercling pocket, then fight to get your feet up, and move up and left to top out.  The initial moves are very powerful, and require lots of body tension.","protection":"1 crashpad for sure, and a second wouldn't hurt.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"O2z0OK2oXO+jeh1vOnnY2w==","name":"Captain Hook","yds":"V9","grades":{"yds":"V9","font":"7C","vscale":"V9"},"fa":"Jesse Margolis, ~ 2000","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29091,39.9889]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105760002","mp_crag_id":"111852435","climb_id":"O2z0OK2oXO+jeh1vOnnY2w==","areaRef":"zTG5SHDhXpWHgNGjSySUHw=="},"content":{"description":"This problem goes through the overhang on the A7 boulder just under the V1 rail traverse.
