Start at the low point of the rock and walk up easy terrain to the base of a headwall. Bypass the headwall to the left (5.2) or turn it via a thin traverse on the right and up (5.5?).\n\nFrom there, romp up to the first summit on easy rock, and proceed down and up the next couple of summits that appear as you work your way West. From the top of the last pinnacle, a notch separates Easy Street from the East Sentinel Boulder.\n\nDescent - scramble back down and left on the East face for some 20 feet, and traverse into the notch. Downclimb the notch to hiking territory.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,86410ac6-a2da-5a5f-8855-ba74384faafb,dd7a1071-e47e-5fd0-af66-6ed5fce5dc03","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","North","Easy Street"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.2"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.293,39.9872]},"bbox":[-105.29358687967928,39.986750339818144,-105.29241312032075,39.987649660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745951","area_id":"3XoQceR+X9CvZm7V/OXcAw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:02.073Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:36.929Z"}
