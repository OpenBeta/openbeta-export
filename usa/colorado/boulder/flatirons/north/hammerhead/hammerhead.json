It is a little different than your standard, \"easy\" Flatiron route.  Half way up the east ridge, you climb over the longest arch in Boulder.  Try not to think too hard about what would happen if it breaks.  The final pitch is airy, since it traverses the overhanging west face through some ledge systems.  The rock is solid, except for a 10 foot section.\n\nP1 & P2: Follow the east ridge for 400 feet.  Stay within a few feet of the south edge to enjoy the exposure.\n\nP3: Climb on top of a 6 foot boulder that is against the NW corner of the summit block.  Traverse the ledge system moving up at the obvious points.

This arch is apparently the longest arch in the Flatirons and has some great exposure. At this notch, climb down a bit and off the rock. At this point, you have several options, one is call it quits, another is ascend the north face via a short 5.7 pitch, and the last and probably best option is to go up the west face ledges on Yodeling Moves to get to the summit block. Once on the summit you can down limb Yodeling Moves or rap off the slings on top.
