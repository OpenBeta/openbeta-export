It climbs a bulge on the north side of the Potato boulder in BH's Best of Boulder Guidebook (or maybe it's the Egg, anyway it's obvious when you are there)  The guide seems to call it V3(!?)  Not sure if this was a FA or not.  Go do it!\n\nSDS on 2 nice edges, right hand up, big move left to killer sloper, bust to lip...a fantastic hueco-esque problem. Go do it.","protection":"1-2 pads is plenty, could probably do it solo, but its a bit dynamic and you might roll down the hill....","location":"This is the best part...only about a 15 minute (tops) hike from Chautauqua, making it a great quick hit.  If you head northwest from the boulder, you hit the Royal Arch/2nd and 3rd Flatiron trail junction pretty quickly.  From there, you could access the Ssatellite Boulders if you need more bouldering."},"__v":0},{"_id":"n+AIoXHhUUKvdpgLq6yAnA==","name":"Bread and Bella","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"Andy Mann","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.293,39.9872]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105763218","mp_crag_id":"105746683","climb_id":"n+AIoXHhUUKvdpgLq6yAnA==","areaRef":"3FMOy/8xUVut+MVuf560lA=="},"content":{"description":"This is the main line on the backside.
