After the first move to get on the rock, there's a hand hold on a flake above your head on the right that will allow for you to step across with the left foot. At this point, you're directly below a few foot placements that will lead to the top, as there's not very many great hand holds higher up.","protection":"","location":"It is located just to the right of \"\n\nDarth Mater\n\n.\""},"__v":0},{"_id":"IiwoXwRZXlepR2Szu4d/xA==","name":"Norther Darker Side","yds":"V0-","grades":{"yds":"V0-","font":"4-","vscale":"V0-"},"fa":"N/A","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28602,39.98925]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"109236519","mp_crag_id":"105745412","climb_id":"IiwoXwRZXlepR2Szu4d/xA==","areaRef":"3tCYXvYyUv2wivPuay/lGw=="},"content":{"description":"If you're tall, start high and grab a jug.
