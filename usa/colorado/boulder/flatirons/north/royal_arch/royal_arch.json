Start on the west side of this buttress, which is quite steep at the bottom. The first 20' is the crux and is difficult to protect.  Fortunately as you get higher it gets much easier and soon you are on the top.  This pitch is less than 100' long.\n\nTo descend, downclimb the east face route until you can escape to the south.","protection":"Light rack, mostly small stuff.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"v/w0T/KkV6OcQSVBZjUMVg==","name":"East Face/Royal Arch","yds":"Easy 5th","grades":{"yds":"Easy 5th","french":"1+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29138,39.98204]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105755713","mp_crag_id":"105745777","climb_id":"v/w0T/KkV6OcQSVBZjUMVg==","areaRef":"h1Eq9b/WVFynLGcX2JqP2g=="},"content":{"description":"This is a really fun route on great rock and up a major hiking attraction. After all it is not everyday you get to bag an Arch....\n\nStart at the bottom of the East face of the Arch this can be reached after climbing the Regency or simply downclimb/ hike down from the arch after reaching it via the trail.\n\nClimb up a small flatironette at the base for an added 30 feet of climbing or start at the notch between the Flatironette and the East face.\n\nWork your way up via the path of least resistance making sure you are seen by the hikers on the left side of the Arch. For dramatic flair, you may grunt a bit to make them think this is a hard climb.\n\nThe summit is narrow and not necesarily comfortable to hang out. Descend by retracing your steps some 50 feet and moving left (South) to the area below the arch.\n\nTake a deep breath and start signing autographs and dispensing climbing wisdom.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,86410ac6-a2da-5a5f-8855-ba74384faafb,87512af5-bfd6-545c-a72c-6717d89a8fda","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","North","Royal Arch"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29138,39.98204]},"bbox":[-105.29196683535551,39.98159033981814,-105.2907931646445,39.98248966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745777","area_id":"h1Eq9b/WVFynLGcX2JqP2g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:00.912Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:35.600Z"}
