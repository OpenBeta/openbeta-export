Along the way there are many opportunities for moves harder than 5.2, but always a chance to avoid them. This route is probably 4th class, in reality. It ascends 400+ feet of climbing on a rock which is probably 300' tall. Along the way you come to several false summits, similar to the N. Ridge of the first flatiron, but not as clean.  To descend from the Summit, hop off to the NW, go up to the NW around the summit of The Spy and take the Spy Express trail North of the spy back East and then south to the base of the First Flatironette.","protection":"A light rack, or a good solo. The climb is reasonably broken up into shorter sections with good stances and rests, to be done as a solo.

Why is there only one route on this broad slab?  Well, there could be dozens, but the climbing is all generally the same and wandering a little here and there keeps the general difficulty at about 5.2. The only real difference from one section to another is how continuous the climb might be or how many trees and gullies you might pass along the way. Rossiter suggests going up from the low, left-hand edge of the rock past a few gullies to the most continuous and  solid part of the face.  This is perhaps 100 feet up and right of the very base.  I agree that the climbing from this point is great.  Climb up and onward, tending slightly left past flakes, cracks, and pockets for a few pitches to reach the summit.\n\nThis is a fine climb at its grade and perhaps the best Flatirons introduction to slower parties and less confident leaders.  Like any Flatiron, there are to be some runouts, but the lack of difficulty and frequent secure rests will likely keep even a skittish leader's head cool.\n\nDescend by scrambling the ridgeline up top to a point where you can step, hop, or scramble off to the west.  Next, walk north past a gully, past The Spy, and continue North down a hill until you reach a well-traveled East/West Trail. Head East on this trail to gain the cliff base again. This trail is pretty good and should take only 5-10 minutes.","protection":"A standard light rack.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"D4cjo5SBWvmRCEG4CPznFg==","name":"East Face South","yds":"4th","grades":{"yds":"4th","french":"1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29285,39.99195]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"116575610","mp_crag_id":"105746188","climb_id":"D4cjo5SBWvmRCEG4CPznFg==","areaRef":"/BtmjN7oXtac8iscYgs8vg=="},"content":{"description":"This route starts on the south/left half of the formation and does not go to the summit, instead ending at the climbing trail between this rock and the First Flatiron.\n\nStart about 25 feet left of the two gullies that separate the taller right/north half of the Flatironette from the shorter left/south half, on a pine needle-covered area with a step-like root.
