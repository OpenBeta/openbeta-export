Think of it as a quick side trip on your way back from the Royal Arch. If you complete the route and follow the broken ridge at the top, you will wind up at the Sentinel pass where you will be able to pick up the trail and continue on your way back to Chautauqua.\n\nHop on the rock at the lowest point and work you way to the headwall that blocks access to the upper ridge. Negotiate the headwall by traversing right and head up the ridge.\n\nNear the top, and with enough exposure to make it interesting, make two moves of thin, smeary 5.2.\n\nFollow the ridge to Sentinel Pass","protection":"Standard rack","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,d0ca78b6-a3cb-517c-adee-d9c6f8c2d2d8,86410ac6-a2da-5a5f-8855-ba74384faafb,4b26b1b3-bcf6-53fc-8a64-b64cb886988b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Flatirons","North","Two Move Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.2"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.29133,39.98396]},"bbox":[-105.29191685184674,39.983510339818146,-105.29074314815325,39.98440966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745906","area_id":"Syaxs7z2U/yKZLZMuIaYiw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.29191685184674,39.983510339818146],[-105.29074314815325,39.983510339818146],[-105.29074314815325,39.98440966018187],[-105.29191685184674,39.98440966018187],[-105.29191685184674,39.983510339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:00.907Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:54.500Z"}
