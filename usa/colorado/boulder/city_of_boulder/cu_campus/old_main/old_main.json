The fact that you are looking for spots to climb on a college campus points that you probably don't care if it's rock or not. It's something interesting to climb on. The staircase is turquoise and made of old rot-iron. It's ~28 steps spiral upward to a locked door. Grab the back of the 10th or 11th stair to start. Campus you way to the last stair using only your hands and the steps above you.\n\nToo easy?
