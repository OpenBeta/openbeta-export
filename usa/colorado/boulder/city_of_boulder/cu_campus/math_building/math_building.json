Any climbing is undertaken at the climber's own risk.\n\nAscend (free solo) the obvious tower of the math building on its south or west side. The brick is solid and sticks out a couple inches, allowing for continual crimps and pinches (all great, but length makes it pumpy). Slap the gutter on top and begin the downclimb - no easy rests, but no obvious cruxes. Pulling the roof isn't recommended - the flimsy gutter running along the edge makes the mantel quite unstable.\n\nThe arete can be climbed if one is looking for a spicy and exposed variation.\n\nClimbing the math tower draws less attention than climbs in other regions of campus. While many people are still walking by as you climb, they often pay little attention. This may be because engineering students empathize with others who feel the need to throw themselves off a building.\n\nFeatured in the film\n\nReal Rock An Urban Climbing Experience\n\n, releasing May 2019.","protection":"Some cams might fit between bricks, but don't try it.","location":"It is near the intersection of Folsom and Colorado."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,ead45a4c-f171-598c-937d-e3e6cd49c8b8,8f18ffef-13a3-5ef2-aabb-c764c2bcfc1d,ae8545f2-7e1c-5a20-9973-dacc9f5945f1","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","City of Boulder","CU Campus","Math Building"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2"},{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.26413,40.00823]},"bbox":[-105.26471706044285,40.00778033981814,-105.26354293955714,40.00867966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112065636","area_id":"roVF8n4cWiCZc9rMn1lF8Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:58.088Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:31.344Z"}
