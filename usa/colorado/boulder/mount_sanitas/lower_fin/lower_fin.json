This problem rates two stars for sure, although three stars could probably be justified - by Sanitas standards, this is a classic problem.\n\nStart on the far right side of the Fin and do V1 moves left on good holds with cruddy feet.  After 10-12 feet you will reach a jug and a decent pseudo-rest.  Then launch through the crux - solid V2 moves, more aesthetic the higher you go (which still leaves your feet only 3 feet off the ground).  After the crux, there is a stretch of cool underclinging before topping out on juggy holds (V0).\n\nIf you are looking for a very safe, fun, and continuous V2 boulder problem, this one is hard to beat.","protection":"A spotter is always recommended.
