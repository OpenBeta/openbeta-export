While guidebooks may refer to this route as 3 pitches, it is normally climbed in one pitch. There are anchors atop each pitch (or section). Between 2007 & 2013, I repeated this route every year. It became my favorite climb at Vampire Rock. A helmet is advised for the belayer. Even though the rock is pretty solid, I was almost hit by a sizable piece of rock that my partner accidentally broke off below the anchor on pitch 1.\n\nAfter climbing the first 50 feet of\n\nWanker\n\n(.12a), clip a bolt just right of the anchor for pro with a long draw or sling, rather than clip the anchor. This will keep the rope line straighter.\n\nPitch 2 (.12b). Climb over the roof. This begins from jugs underneath to reach a jam at the lip. Clip the 2nd bolt, and crank a show stopper crux getting over the lip. Once standing at the lip, there is a bolt with a chain to clip, before balancing up the slab to a jug. Clip a bolt to the right, & clip out of the chain. Move up right to a no hands rest stance at an anchor, 4 bolts & a 2 bolt anchor.\n\nPitch 3 (5.11d/12a). Clip 2 close bolts above the anchor, putting a long sling on the 1st bolt and a long draw on the 2nd bolt. Clip out of the anchor and the last bolt on pitch 2 to reduce rope drag. Ascend a tiered overhang with a final crux past the 4th bolt. Gain a sloping ledge above the lip. Move up right to the anchor, 5 bolts & a 3 bolt anchor.\n\nCleaning can be tricky. Use the left two anchor bolts, not all three. Lower down pitch 3 and notice that your rope is running in the best spot on the final lip. Â Stop at the pitch 2 anchor and clip in. Untie and pull your rope down. Lower off the 2nd anchor, which works well to clean the rest of the route (pitch 2 and 1).","protection":"19 clips and a 3 bolt anchor.

Although there is a lot of loose rock on this route, I give it three stars because there are quality sections, it has interesting position, thought provoking moves and it's rare to get this far off the deck in Boulder Canyon.  I think it's a Kor route.\n\nP1.  There are two ways to start.  Either climb the bolted route '\n\nThat's Weak\n\n' up to the chain anchors, or climb the left angling corner system which starts 20 fee to the right of '\n\nThat's Weak\n\n' up to the same fate.  In keeping with the spirit of the climb, I prefer the original start up the corner system.  Some loose rock, but the pro is adequate and it goes at about 5.7.

Not sure if we did the correct last pitch, but this way was stellar.  Climb up the ramp a bit further and work up into a left facing corner with a nice crack.  Good jugs lead up to a steep layback and fist crack, past a basketball sized bush (as of 9/3/02) and tops out on a low angled slab with insecure holds.

There is some loose rock on this route but nothing I think will come off any time soon. Just be careful what you grab and what you put pro behind. We trundled all of the loose stuff that we could get to move, so it should be fine--but this is more of an adventure climb.\n\nP1 (10a). Follow thin cracks up blocky terrain a few feet right of the large, dirty corner. The upper third of this pitch has nice moves along a thin seam in good rock. We left 3 fixed knifeblades for pro in this section (UPDATE 7/2016: now bolted). Look for a 2 bolt anchor to the left after the knifeblade section.  This anchor is about 10 feet below where\n\nVampire\n\ncrosses in from the right.\n\nP2 (10+/11-?). Climb up and right, into the left-facing corner between \"\n\nVampire\n\n(P2)\" and \"\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Jacked\n\n\".  The corner leans right for about 20 feet and climbs a lot more interesting than it looks from below. Enjoy the jug rest below the roof (often heavily chalked from people on\n\nGood, Bad,...\n\n), and then punch it through the bulge above on great finger locks. This crack leads you to the slab that is at the end of P2 of the\n\nVampire\n\n. Belay as for P2 of the\n\nVampire\n\n.\n\nSeveral options exist from here.
