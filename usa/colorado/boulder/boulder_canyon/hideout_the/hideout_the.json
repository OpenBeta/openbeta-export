From here, sprint up the arete, making increasingly difficult and technical moves until you get to a reachy crux, which is followed by a strenuous clip and a very cool but draining mantel sequence that takes you to the chains.\n\nThis route missed classic status, because it lacks the aesthetics and length that people expect of a four star route; however, The Holdup compensates for this with amazing moves, great rock, and a nice line. Plus, being South-facing and well out of the canyon, this is a great option for cold, sunny days in the winter.\n\nDue to the distance between holds at the crux, this route could feel a bit easier for tall people and way harder for short people.
