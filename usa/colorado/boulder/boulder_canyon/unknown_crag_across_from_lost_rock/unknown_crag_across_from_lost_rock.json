It is lower angle than expected, but there is the blunt arete, tiny roof low, and awkward roof high which can make it a bit more interesting.\n\nFollow slabby moves up.  Pro is left of the tiny roof.  You can follow the cleaner, blunt arete if you're the third.  Continue up easy terrain.  ~140' up there is another interesting roof.  Pro for the roof (?~#3 Camalot) gets in the way to jam.  Trust the high step smear and yard.  Alternately, you can chicken off right (making it 5.6 overall) and around the little roof.\n\nInterestingly, the next, brushy dihedral to the right has an old sling.  Any info?\n\nWalkoff to the left and down a gully.","protection":"A light rack to #4.5 Camalot.","location":"This is on the left side of the face.
