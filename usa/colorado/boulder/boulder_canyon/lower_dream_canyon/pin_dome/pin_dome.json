There is a mine pit about 25 ft. right of the route. Climb past 4 bolts to a cool and devious, orange arete - 2 more bolts will get you to the anchors.\n\nRecommended. This would be very popular if it were more easily accessible. The best approach is probably from the Upper Dream Canyon parking lot. From the left side of the lot, look downhill and follow cairns leading towards Boulder Canyon, skirting a shack with a decrepit outhouse on the left. Weave your way down to the impressive Big Sky routes, then on down to Mine All Mine.
