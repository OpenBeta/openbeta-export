S.L.O. is left about 15 feet on the detached, leaning block. The route goes up the obvious left angling, offset seam above the horizontal crack. Go up the slot on the right and place gear in the horizontal. Get your feet onto the horizontal and tiptoe left around the arete to the seam. It's a little hairy leaning out left to spot the gear at the start of the seam. Once looking up at the seam there is a TCU placement followed by a nut or two.
