While fundamentally solid, this route still has a bit of breaking in to be done. Some lichen or a bit of flakey rock may be encountered. The principal holds, however, are good, and the gear is all good. There is some optional gear placement opportunity between the top two bolts, so the route can be safely done without this, and the crux is done prior to that point. We found the route to be about 5.9, a bit harder than the grade assigned by the book.","protection":"This route is protected with 4 bolts and arrives at a bolt and ring rap anchor. Below the final bolt an optional medium cam placement or large nut can be placed.","location":"This will likely be the first route you see or pass if you approached the rock from Happy Hour Crag. It lies at the left side of the South face of this crag and starts from a large shelf which is considerably above the starting point of the West face routes. The belay and trail to this point are stable and low-slope."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,e519a674-a620-509c-9e86-a246f84a8e40,81c57d42-2651-506d-be7c-0f217b3cc8a0,43fc2070-3965-5f90-8bc2-d73ac0648d86","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Boulder Canyon","Kanjiklub","South Face"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.39646,40.00444]},"bbox":[-105.39704702785178,40.003990339818145,-105.3958729721482,40.00488966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120193590","area_id":"Q/wgcDllX5CLwtc6wGSNhg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:56.809Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:28.414Z"}
