The bottom can be climbed from the right side of the arete upward with a spotter, then the crux can be pulled on either side of the arete, with the right side being what is forced by the position of the bolt, though the left is possible. Once the crux is pulled, the climb goes right on obvious crack systems. The stars on the route are for the upper section. The boulder problem at the bolt is an interesting diversion but not destination-worthy in and of itself.","protection":"While a single bolt protects the crux, a standard light rack, perhaps with extra in the 2\" range is needed for the crack to the top. Bring some long slings.","location":"At the far left arete of Electra Glide crag, there is a single bolt at a bulge on the wall. Work up to this on the arete from the left (moderate) or the right (harder, heads up, 2\" cam for protection when you need it) and clip the bolt  when you come to the second bulge.  The bolt was formerly junk, but newly replaced with 316 SS Climbtech equipment on 9/2/15.\n\nPull onto the corner and up part this bolt on the right, and continue up and right to the crack of\n\nElectra Glide\n\njust above the small roof on that climb. This does not finish on Electra Glide, as per the D'Antonio book, but breaks off back left of E.G. and finishes on 5.9 climbing on it's own, a-la the Rossiter guide. Place gear (1.75\" +/-), and head back left on 5.9+ moves well above gear in spots to a 2-2.5\" cam in an overlapping flake/crack, then continue to two bolts on top with the fixed rap station to belay or descend.\n\nA variation of this also goes free (Haas/Bubb 9/2015) whereas you climb the left side of the arete, clipping the bolt on the right with a 2' sling, get up onto the ledge and then climb directly up the arete on the left without diverting to Electra Glide for any progress (you can place gear there, sure) and head to the top.  This is 5.10 PG-13 for several spots that might cause a little pause to think about consequences.  We considered additional hardware, but frankly, it would have changed the existing routes."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,e519a674-a620-509c-9e86-a246f84a8e40,47009d7b-0d8f-5d99-a9e0-21bfba8c2a29","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Boulder Canyon","Electra Glide"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.4134,40.0016]},"bbox":[-105.41398700343406,40.00115033981814,-105.41281299656593,40.002049660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105744635","area_id":"RwCdew2PXZmp4CG/uowqKQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.41398700343406,40.00115033981814],[-105.41281299656593,40.00115033981814],[-105.41281299656593,40.002049660181854],[-105.41398700343406,40.002049660181854],[-105.41398700343406,40.00115033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:56.813Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:48.410Z"}
