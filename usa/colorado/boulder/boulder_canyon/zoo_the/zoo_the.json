Although the cliff does extend for a little ways to the left of this route, it is approximately in the middle of the cliff.  Look for the bolts leading up just to the left of a small dihedral.   The moves on this route are consistently difficult.  There are two cruxes, and both of them are well protected.  This route is significantly harder if the quickdraws are not already hung. Unless you are very tall, expect some difficulties reaching the bolts when hanging the 'draws.  Aside from being poorly bolted (don't worry, it's still well protected, it's just that every bolt seems to be about 6 inches out of reach), this is a pretty good route.
