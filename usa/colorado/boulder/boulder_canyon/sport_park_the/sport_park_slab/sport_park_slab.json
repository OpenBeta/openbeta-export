This comes to the first of many ledges.  Climb up through the second bolt, and 5.6 crux to another ledge.  From there, you have a crack on the right of the bolt line, and lots of good feet.  Pass a couple more ledges and clip the anchor from a ledge just below and left of it.  The route can be walked off to the right, and it deposits you at Surprising Crag.\n\nIt would be a two rope rap, and lowering is not really an option.  You can easily belay from the anchor then walk off.","protection":"8 bolts with a 2 bolt anchor at the top.  Lots of places for trad gear as a backup.  Several cracks and ledges lend to easy clips and gear placement.","location":"This looked like the only route on the Sport Park Slab.
