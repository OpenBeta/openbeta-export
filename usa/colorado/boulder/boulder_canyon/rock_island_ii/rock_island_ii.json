As-is, this is really just a fun way to set up an TR for the Candelaria Crack. This route lies maybe 10 feet to the right (towards the car) from the Candelaria Crack, a finger crack in a right-facing dihedral-like feature. About 20 feet long, this route would be a fun short lead (or highball boulder problem) if you're looking for something to do, or if you want to TR its .12a neighbor. To retrieve your anchor, climb the route, pull the gear, and scramble/walk to the north to a trough, fairly obvious from the ground.","protection":"Takes great finger-sized gear, maybe down to a green alien. I placed a #7 HB Offset, followed shortly by a maroon Trango 4-cam just above in the finger crack.
