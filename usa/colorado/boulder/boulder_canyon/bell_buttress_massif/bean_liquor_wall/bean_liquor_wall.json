Tricky moves passing the second clip yield to a powerful dyno or a subtle jam. Run up on killer jugs to a short, delicate and balancey move just before the anchor.

The nifty sequence at the end can be avoided either to the left or the right. However, with the final clip well above your chest when pulling the move, why cheat yourself?
