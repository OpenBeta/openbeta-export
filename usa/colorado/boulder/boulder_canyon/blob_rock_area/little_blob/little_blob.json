It was a little dirty, and the start is a little dangerous, but once you get past the bad rock at the bottom, there is good gear and fun moves on great rock. The crux comes right away and feels harder than it is due to suspect holds, lichen and bad gear above a bad landing.

It lets up quickly after the crux, unlike its more demanding neighbors.\n\nI found the two routes to the left (\n\nLost And Found\n\n&\n\nTake Five\n\n) to be more continuous and enjoyable, but this route is certainly worth the effort if you're in the area.","protection":"5 or 6 bolts, and a chain anchor.
