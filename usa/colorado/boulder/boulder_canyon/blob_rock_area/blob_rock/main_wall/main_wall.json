The crux tackles this roof directly via an overhanging corner with a very thin crack in the back.  You can place good gear down low, but higher up the corner where the crux is, your pro consists of RPs.  Back when this was rated 9+ we used to piss and moan about how Dan Hare could call this 5.9.  The exit moves above the roof are exciting and thin, then traverse right to a nice 2 bolt anchor (courtesy Dan Hare).  80'.\n\nIt is possible to climb around the crux on the left, which is really the route \"Center Direct (5.9+)\".  This involves an awkward hand traverse left along a leaning crack which begins where the normal crux does.  Not recommended unless you forgot your RPs.\n\nP2. The second pitch climbs a crackless corner and/or the slab to the right, and ends at the eagle's nest where the climb got its name.  This pitch is only about 60' long and has very little pro.  It used to be 5.8 but has been upgraded to 5.9 in the latest guide.  I'd still call it 5.8 s. 35'.\n\nP3. The final exciting pitch moves right through a roof on a steep, exposed flake, turns the corner and heads straight up beautiful hand cracks to the top.

We slung the bolt with a wire stopper, but this did not inspire confidence as the next pitch is run-out 5.8.

Under the Eagle's Wing starts at the right side of that flake. A little to the right of that you will see two bolts which are the start of the new first pitch of\n\nOctober Surprise\n\n. Just left of that is a short, right-facing corner capped by a roof, the start of Resolution.\n\nP1: Climb the corner and swing left through the roof (or perhaps chimney up past the overhang). Protect your second, then angle gently left along grooves following a vague, white dike that becomes more prominent higher up. At one point, where it starts to get a bit difficult, step right and up to another slab. Continue easily to the base of a vertical headwall. To your left is a right-leaning offwidth crack. Get gear high and left then undercling and make a long reach diagonally right across the steep face to an incut jug. You will need approximately a 6' wing span to make this reach. It may be possible to do this move some other, more difficult way. Plan B would be to climb the offwidth through the bulge (not trivial). Bring a #4.5 Camalot for that. Back to the jug... step right across the face and up an easy slab. Angle left a bit to regain the white dike. At a dirty, thin, right-leaning crack through a bulge, step left onto a slab and up to a ledge. Belay somewhere here or traverse right to the\n\nOn Ballet\n\n/\n\nOctober Surprise\n\nbolts.

Get gear high then rock around left onto a foothold and stand. No gear here despite the thin crack at your face. Reach high, if you can, to a knob, and step up to reach past the bulging face to a horizontal. A #2 Camalot protects the easy move onto the upper slab.
