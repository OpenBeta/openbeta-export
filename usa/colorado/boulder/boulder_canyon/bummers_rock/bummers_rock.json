It starts on a flat area at the very base of the granite slabs. The first pitch follows a slab to the anchors that is broken in two places by horizontal seams. The first pitch is easy 5.7 or so slab climbing with 2 bolts to an anchor. The next pitch continues up the face to the left (follow the bolts). There is a mantle move that I would call the crux at the second bolt of the second pitch. The route then continues to top out with easier climbing.","protection":"This is a bolted sport climb so bring quickdraws, however a small rack of nuts and cams is a good idea if you are squeamish about runouts. Bring your usual set-up for 2-bolt anchors. There is no rappel ring on the anchors of the first pitch (I left a 'biner), so someone might want to equip one.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"dLANQqEsVKyzBRkkH65vsg==","name":"Suspended Man","yds":"5.12b","grades":{"yds":"5.12b","french":"7b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3434,40.0095]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105748151","mp_crag_id":"105744576","climb_id":"dLANQqEsVKyzBRkkH65vsg==","areaRef":"Kt3xp/rPWB6bq6pQ/4wCLw=="},"content":{"description":"I only climbed the first pitch of this route, and it sucked big time. Super easy slab leads to a vertical section with no pro, save for a bolt which someone made unuseable by flattening it into the rock. The second pitch continues up much better rock through some hard climbing (5.12 moves) to the top. The route can be found about 25 or 30 feet to the left (West) of \"Thanks Bill\". Look for the anchors at the top of the first pitch above a vertical section of rock at the top of the initial slab.","protection":"It's a sport climb, but take some cams and nuts for the first pitch. OK, PAY ATTENTION HERE: Some fool hammered the bolt hangers flat against the rock on the anchors of the first pitch. There is a sling and a locking biner threaded through one of them, but not the other. You can NOT fit biners through the anchors here, so bring some spare slings too.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,e519a674-a620-509c-9e86-a246f84a8e40,2addf1a7-facf-581e-9bab-aa50ff8c022f","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Boulder Canyon","Bummers Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3434,40.0095]},"bbox":[-105.34398707136525,40.00905033981814,-105.34281292863477,40.00994966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105744576","area_id":"Kt3xp/rPWB6bq6pQ/4wCLw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:56.817Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:41.266Z"}
