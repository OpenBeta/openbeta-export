The dirty and treacherous start and shortness of the route more than makes up for the decent hand-jamming on the upper half.\n\nRossiter says first ascent unknown, perhaps c. 1982 and perhaps named then Dogge Doo Buttress.

Wriggle up a little higher to a jug and the base of the hand crack. From there it's straightforward to the top of the pillar.\n\nGetting down: Rossiter shows the route scrambling up and left, but that's a long way. Instead, set up a trad anchor in a crack above the pod above the right side of the pillar and lower down clipping the bolt anchor of No Man is an Island (hard to see on the right side of the pillar). You can't easily just run the rope from the top of the crack through the anchor bolts, because that would form a double right angle bend across the top of the pillar. The second can clean the trad anchor, climb down to the bolts and lower or rappel from there.","protection":"Doubles from green Alien to hand-sized cams.
