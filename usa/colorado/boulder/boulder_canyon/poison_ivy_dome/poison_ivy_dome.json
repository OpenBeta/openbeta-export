The safe way to start this is to get into the crag/dihedral to the left and then clip. Move up and right onto the bolt line as the dome lessens in angle. There are a few cool holds along the crack. You'll get a good deal of rope drag from the top of the featured crag.\n\nYou can do a more direct start, but you'll pull the crux (5.8) before you can clip the 1st bolt.
