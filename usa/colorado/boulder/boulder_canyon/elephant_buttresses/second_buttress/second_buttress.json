Scrtamble up between Elephant #1 nad #2, keeping an eye to the right for a huge hanging flake with a finger-to-hand crack traversing out right under it and then upward.  This is about 10' up the route.Pitch 1: Set a belay below and then tackle this flake.  Pulling past it is the P1 crux at 5.9+, then head up descent cracks toward the bottom of the routes Tough Situation and Classic Finger Crack. The climbing eases for a while.Pitch #2: According to the guidebook we used, you climb a thin crack up the left edge of the face above, on the buttress face left of the afformentioned two neighboring routes. There is no crack there, however. JUST BARELY left of these is a rusted total crap bolt that is very hard just to get to and dangerous, it joins Tough Situation after perhaps 25'.  Around the corner to the left there is a junk-filled crack that looks pretty easy and also seems unlikely to be the route.After playing around on trying to figure out the hard-looking seam above the bolt just right of Tough Situation, I decided to do Tough Situation and set a TR for the line aside of it. The face past the bolt goes squarely at 5.11, at least 5.11c if you ask me, but I have not done enough trad routes at that grade in BC to distinguish the grades finely. A foothold (a generous name for what I was standing on) snapped off while I was on it, and I must have taken 3 falls on TR. Any one of which would have mangled me on lead if the bolt popped. This pitch felt LOADS harder than What's Up (5.10d) or Left Wing (5.10c) which I on-sighted wet. This felt somewhere between FM (5.11c), but less secure, or Avalon Rising (12b/c).\n\nIf you have info about this route or how such a massive misgrade might have occurred, please post relivant info.","protection":"For the first pitch, a set of stoppers and rack of cams from TCU-hand sized + a few tricams if you like them.
