It is not worth a trip, but if you are on top, you might as well do 4 routes for 100 feet climbing, as 3 for 75. This is a 4th route and is the second hardest of them. While I can find no documentation of it, it seems likely that it has been done many-a-time.\n\nClimb up onto a large spike of rock on the arete and establish yourself onto some footholds. This initial 'flake' looks loose at first, but inspection showed that it was well attached at the base, and part of the main cliff. Use a horizontal to protect and stabilize, then continue to the top of the rock. This is more of a boulder problem than anything, but it has a terrible landing in TV-sized jumbled rocks on a slope, so perhaps roping up is for the better.","protection":"A few small cams or nuts.
