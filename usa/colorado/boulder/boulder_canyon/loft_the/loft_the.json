It has fun but hard to read climbing.  An onsight would be proud!  Start in small crack (between orange lichen streaks - crux) and continue up the wall.  Pull over a small bulge/overhang and angle up face near right hand arete.\n\nThe crux crack feels a bit committing because of the ground being close and a lack of gear.  There is a really good stopper placement (long reach) that does protect the crux, although it is hard to reach up and clip it in....  The stopper is fixed.  A stick might be nice to clip it? All in all, it is not too bad though.\n\nThere is a bolted anchor on a ledge most of the way up the wall.","protection":"Standard rack to a #2 Camalot max. Two #0.75s are good.  Offset cams work well also. A gray/purple Metolius cam works well in a horzontal near the top.","location":"Ascend gully between Vampire / Black Widow, continue up faint trail to a small wall. This wall can be seen from the road (look for bright orange lichen)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,decc1251-4a67-52b9-b23f-3243e10e93d0,e519a674-a620-509c-9e86-a246f84a8e40,d3416c9d-c754-576c-9a58-ad629f5ce388","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Boulder","Boulder Canyon","Loft, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.4102,40.0024]},"bbox":[-105.41078701031195,40.00195033981813,-105.40961298968807,40.00284966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107593735","area_id":"00FsncdUV2yaWK1in1zjiA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.41078701031195,40.00195033981813],[-105.40961298968807,40.00195033981813],[-105.40961298968807,40.00284966018186],[-105.41078701031195,40.00284966018186],[-105.41078701031195,40.00195033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:56.272Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:18.060Z"}
