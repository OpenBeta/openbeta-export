Double ropes would certainly make the belay easier, given that the route starts right and the belayer is to the left of the ledge. Toproping is the most easy and obvious solution to this problem.\n\nTo do this route, head up the first few feel to the ledge at the start of '\n\nBridge From the Underworld\n\n,' going left (behind) the small pine tree and traversing to the right side of the ledge. Find a good sidepull in a seam to the right of the ledge, pull up onto a right foot hold, and establish a stance. A few Aliens (green, yellow) can go in to protect this with long slings. Make a few more insecure moves up to an undercling at a small roof-like feature, get in some more protection (green Camalot + another Alien + long sling), and start heading up and left on small holds and smears to the underside of a small arch, continuing left under that feature with no protection. The rock here felt solid and high-friction.\n\nAt the end of the small arch, you intersect and cross left through '\n\nBridge From the Underworld\n\n, climbing a few feet of it and placing another piece before stepping left into the thin crack to the left of the right-facing, shallow corner of that route.\n\nSmall to medium stoppers and small cams can protect the thin crack until it runs out, becoming a flaring seam. Here you find a few good holds, and head up and left onto the arete and around it, onto some pinches and incuts above good horns of granite, heading up and left with not much gear for a few solid moves. Eventually you arrive where\n\nBloodletting\n\nand '\n\nBridge From the Underworld\n\n' merge at the 2-bolt anchor.","protection":"A rack from tiny to 2.5\" cams with some small to medium stoppers for the upper crack and some long slings to help the drag reasonable.
