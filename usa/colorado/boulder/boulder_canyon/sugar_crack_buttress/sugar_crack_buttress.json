There are two hand cracks that access the slab, and we took the right of the two. Once on the slab, move up and left, and protect in a few horizontals.

While it is not a route to push your limits on, good protection can be had the whole way and the flake is actually pretty well-attached.\n\nScramble up some slabby junk out of the ditch along the road and to a ledge below the obvious flake. Place gear under and in the flake and pull up and into it.  Continue past good stances and rests, placing sometimes hard-to-see gear in the flakes every 4-5 feet (double set of Aliens if you want to sew it up), and top out of the flake on face holds.  A horizontal with a thin-hands placement comes just as you run out of flake to protect.  Make a few moves left and pull over a slight bulge onto a slab and continue up and left to the summit of the rock, protecting in good horizontals most of the time.","protection":"Mostly finger-sized TCUs or Aliens, so consider a double set of narrow-profile cams if you want to stitch it up - perhaps a good idea since the flake is thin and some gear might not hold a whipper. Larger cam opportunities exist too, so take a full set of cams to 3\" and a few long slings.\n\nA gear anchor up top can be had prior to walking off to the West.","location":"This climb is on the SW buttress of the Sugar Crack Wall.
