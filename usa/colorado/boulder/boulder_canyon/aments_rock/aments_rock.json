On toprope, I found that two decent pieces can be placed once the flake turns more or less vertical.  An s rating is still appropriate since a fall before these placements could ground you on the slab below and after the two cams, you must make the crux moves with no further pro.\n\nStart at the right side of the cliff and head up to the small, short, R-facing dihedral.  You can place a couple pieces before heading left onto the slab.\n\nUndercling the flake and make a couple of moves left.  At this point, the fracture in the flake ends and a small offset (0.25/0.5 Friend) will sit well in a pod.  A few feet higher, another small cam around the 0.3-0.5 range fits.\n\nAfter this gear, make the crux moves on thin holds up the slab.  The route is basically over after the slab.  Walkoff to the R or L is possible.","protection":"Micro cams, small Aliens, or the like up to #1 Friend.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"H1hnljNkWN2J3eqkAweojw==","name":"Aids","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Pat Ament & Linda Schneider, 1984","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3108,40.0156]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105764106","mp_crag_id":"105746686","climb_id":"H1hnljNkWN2J3eqkAweojw==","areaRef":"UNPCi4WrXvi41bEXmr97kA=="},"content":{"description":"If you are in search of obscure routes with stars in Rossiter's guidebook, this may be on your list.  Well...it is close to the road, you won't find crowds, your cell phone reaches here, sun, but it ain't that great.  Crack, yes, but it doesn't climb like typical crack.  1 star... barely.  Wiggly Seam (esp on TR) is better but has much less pro.\n\nFind this route on a clean-looking, South-facing, slab located just right of the trail after you turn left crossing the bridge that accesses the Dome & Frogman Pinnacle.  Beware of poison ivy on the approach.\n\nAscend the crumbly slab to the roof below this route.  Move to the left end of the roof.  The crack starts as an incipient just over the roof.  Pop over the roof left or right of the crack.  Either lieback the crack or sort-of-jam the right-angling crack to the top, 50 feet.  Walk off left.\n\nYou can bail off left to climb the arete (5.6?), Deb's Arete, if you get to the start of the crack & don't like the looks of it on lead.","protection":"Light rack to #3 Camalot.
