Work your way up the first crack sequence (above the obvious traverse). Your feet will end up in the traverse hand holds. The holds are relatively small - footwork is essential. Use the vertical crack left of the \"Center Crack\" route up & over the top. Use care on the last sequence (climbing out of the vertical crack) as a fall here could potentially break an ankle.
