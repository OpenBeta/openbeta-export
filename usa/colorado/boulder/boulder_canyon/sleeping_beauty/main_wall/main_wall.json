Step back left into the crack and continue with some stems to a ledge. You could belay here if you are running low on gear, but the wide crack above is much easier than it looks. You need one or two hand-sized cams and a #3 Camalot to finish the pitch. Continue up the crack at about 5.8 until it gets wide again. Move up on big footholds to clip the 2nd bolt and make an 8ish move to gain a good foothold in the crack. Another couple of easy moves lead to a ledge and the anchor.\n\nP2: 70' 5.9: I got rained off and didn't do this pitch. It looks very low angle with many dishes. Rossiter says it's 5.9. Maybe so, but it looks way easier. Leave any trad gear at the belay, since this pitch is sport.","protection":"Pitch 1 is trad with 2 bolts at wide sections. Single set finger sized (could do without), double in 0.75 to #3 Camalot, #3.5 Camalot, #4 Camalot (could do without). Backclean or move cams up when you can. Pitch 2 is sport with 5 bolts.
