The flake 10' up seems to be a ball-and-socket and can not seem to be removed, but does wobble a bit and so is less than ideal for gear.  Start off with a small-ish stopper and a small Alien (green?) in a small crack, then go up and over. The big flake is a bomber hand/foot.","location":"The center of 3 cracks on the West Face holds a flake about 3 or 4 meters up that juts out quite strangely.

Any difficulty would be more likely encountered at the bulge up top. Perhaps this is even a good route to introduce a climber to wide cracks on, and familiarize oneself or others with arm bars, chicken wings and knee-locks before one gets on a climb where difficulty actually requires it.\n\nStart with a hand-to-fist section, up past some wide crack in a left-facing corner, then up over a small awkward bulge and to the top.
