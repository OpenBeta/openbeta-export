Three pitches of moderate and obvious crack climbing on the northwest rib attains the short summit block.  While there is loose rock on the ledges, the route itself is pretty clean and well protected with a standard rack, and climbs much like a steep flatiron.  Note that the entrance moves on the first pitch have some moss, but it is clean the rest of the way up.\n\nTo descend, scramble off the summit pedestal below the summit block to the south, and head west down the steep gully.  This is a safe scramble for 200 meters, until you come to the obvious tower.  Scramble down again to the west of the lower tower to the creek for a safe crossing; the lower gully to the east is steep and unstable.\n\nIt is also possible to descend down the east side of the crag via a steep dirt path; this may be easier than the west side descent.","protection":"A standard rack.
