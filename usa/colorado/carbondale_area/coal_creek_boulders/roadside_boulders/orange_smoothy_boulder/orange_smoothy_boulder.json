Go up and right to a small crimp and then straight up to the obvious, huge flake at the top. This climbs the right side of the face, but I never ended up using the right arete at all, because the climb never really logically put me in a position to use it. I didn't scrub the crimps with a brush, because I didn't have one, but I cleared off the lichen with my fingers enough to be climbed. The big motivator for this climb was to use the interesting foot cobble above the start hold and the finishing jug flake.\n\nEnjoy!","protection":"A pad or two.","location":"It is on the right side of the\n\nOrange Smoothy\n\nface."},"__v":0},{"_id":"X24a7eFFUWiYyzvB3v+PXw==","name":"Orange Groovy","yds":"V1-2","grades":{"yds":"V1-2","font":"5","vscale":"V1-2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.27734,39.19105]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"107275518","mp_crag_id":"107275502","climb_id":"X24a7eFFUWiYyzvB3v+PXw==","areaRef":"TD2OuSkCVeCRESedAVXrtw=="},"content":{"description":"You start at the monster undercling at the undercut and head left a little bit then up the center of the boulder.","protection":"2 pads.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,7c7b6640-0c0f-5374-89da-91947667afec,2f113d4b-ab50-5abb-8006-a69f6eaac675,048f4c30-a4f3-5553-938d-878f941b8403,4c3d8eb9-2902-55e0-9111-279d0155ebb7","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Carbondale Area","Coal Creek Boulders","Roadside Boulders","Orange Smoothy Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0"},{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V1-2"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.27734,39.19105]},"bbox":[-107.27792017434125,39.19060033981813,-107.27675982565874,39.191499660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107275502","area_id":"TD2OuSkCVeCRESedAVXrtw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.27792017434125,39.19060033981813],[-107.27675982565874,39.19060033981813],[-107.27675982565874,39.191499660181854],[-107.27792017434125,39.191499660181854],[-107.27792017434125,39.19060033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:06.570Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:04.592Z"}
