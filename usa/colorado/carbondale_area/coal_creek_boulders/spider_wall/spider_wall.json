(You can sit start just below the ledges.) You stand up and reach high and stem out right to a great foot hold, then you grab a two finger crimp with your left. There used to be a huge flake you could palm on, and in the process of making the route, the flake broke. It forced us to have to try to do the lower crack that starts to die out and has very crimpy finger locks. I personally think that the line will go, but I can't do it at this point in time.
