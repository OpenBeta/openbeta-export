It appears easier than it climbs. There are places on this route from which you don't want to fall.\n\nP1. Start right of a tree near a crack beginning above the ground. The first bulge can be done directly, but it would be noticeably harder than the rating given here. I went right after placing a cam and feeling out the slopers above the bulge. Connect back left into the crack. Climb a trickier-than-it-looks-to-protect flare. Move up to another little bulge with jugs left above a ledge. Surmount the final bulge above a ledge (right is easier) to a belay ledge.\n\nP2. This second pitch may be shared by a number of the trad lines on this side of the crag. Move left into an inviting, leaning dihedral with big holds. Gain a ledge. Boulder over another ledge at a horn. FWIW, you may be able to traverse off right after 1 pitch.\n\nWalk off to the right and angle gently towards the backside of the crag.","protection":"We used a rack with a yellow Alien, #0.5-#4 (old size) Camalots, and #10 & #11 hexes.
