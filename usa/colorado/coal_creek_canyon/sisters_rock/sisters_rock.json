The route has the feel of a Flatiron east face route but for the granite and quiet view of the continental divide.\n\nThe climb can be made more or less difficult depending on your route choice. Staying in corners and near flakes, there are plenty of holds and places for protection. Move a little left or right, and you have smooth slab climbing with small crimps and less protection.\n\nThe route can not be sewn up, but something is usually available within 10 feet. It only feels run out just below the major horizontal ramp, halfway up, coming out of a corner and over a bulgy slab. There are many belay ledges to choose from.\n\nIf necessary, you can bail just under half way up, via a large, horizontal ramp. You can easily walk off the slab at the top of the climb.\n\nThe rock quality is pretty good on this route, and the slab is surprisingly clean considering it gets little traffic, but the lack of traffic means that holds are not tested, and loose rocks are not cleaned on a regular basis. There are places where the surface is exfoliating, so double check your feet on the slabby sections.","protection":"A standard rack.
