I am giving both lines V10, but I’d say Army of Darkness could be harder and\n\nDark Shadows\n\na little easier if you know how to knee scum. There is potential for an easier line out the other side of roof, but a fall from the slab could be your last one. Both lines can be done from a “stand” with your left hand around the arete on a blocky sidepull and your right hand on the undercling pinch. That is probably in the V8 range, with the left being easier and the right harder.","protection":"The landing is pretty good. The problem covers a lot of ground from the back. 4 pads and a blubber was perfect. I shifted all the slabs from the back of the roof to form a landing. A spotter could be helpful for the end of Army of Darkness. A pendulum swing off the cliff band would not be very fun. I fell there a few times and was fine.","location":"You can see the boulder up on the hillside from the parking. It is a large, square boulder sitting on the edge of the cliff band. You can approach via a deer trail that skirts the hillside above the ditch. It is not super obvious. I would recommend approaching it from the trail."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,74632cc0-a38c-534d-8344-0ada57f54a44,a15a3839-b6c4-553f-a6ba-533cc399b1f1,277859e2-29fb-5117-a121-b1ea70fec079","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Lyons","Rabbit Mountain","Roof on Hillside- Army of Darkness Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V10"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.21587,40.24586]},"bbox":[-105.21645911628752,40.245410339818136,-105.2152808837125,40.24630966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120775575","area_id":"J3hZ4in7URehIbHqcP7AeQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:51.261Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:39.069Z"}
