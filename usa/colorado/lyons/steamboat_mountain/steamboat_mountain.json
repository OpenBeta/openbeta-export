On the first pitch, difficult, wide stems lead to an overhang, over which you must reach high for a good jam. Continue jamming and liebacking up the vertical corner to a ledge.\n\nThe second pitch climbs ledgy, blocky terrain to the rim. Beware of loose rock.  While following, Claire pulled off a block bigger than she was, and she fell. The block hit the ground near our packs. We walked off to the east and down to the south, then northwest along the base to our packs.","protection":"We had hexes and stoppers.  I placed a #11 Hex at the overhang on p.1.  Today, I would take SR through four inches Â— maybe doubles on two through three inches.","location":"This route features the longest, most obvious clean dihedral on the whole cliff band and is found about one third of the way from the right end of the cliff band.
