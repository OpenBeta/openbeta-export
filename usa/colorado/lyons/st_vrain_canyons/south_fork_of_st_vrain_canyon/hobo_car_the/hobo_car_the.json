A few thin moves and another bolt come next, then a couple of good jugs, then onto some 5.easy, water-streaked, walk-up slab and 2 more (homemade) hangers.  Finish at a single coldshut.\n\nFiguring out how to deal with the flake and then the ensuing thin face sequence are the two distinct cruxes.","protection":"There are five bolts and a coldshut.\n\nGillett's guide suggests slinging a tree to back-up the coldshut, but, as of 3/17/12, that tree has been uprooted and is resting on its side with some large, loose rocks perched next to it.  There are some other trees farther back from the edge, but you'll good length of webbing to reach them.\n\nThe PG-13 rating is due to some unpleasant fall/landing potential (between the first two bolts and then again between bolts #2 and #3).","location":"The most obvious feature of The Hobo Car is a large roof about midway down its length.  Meat in a Wine Glass is uphill maybe 30 feet from the roof.  The large flake and its nasty OW gap are easy to find.\n\nThis route is the leftmost line of bolts on the rock.\n\nWalk around climber's left and uphill to access the coldshut for TR. Reverse this to walk-off."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,74632cc0-a38c-534d-8344-0ada57f54a44,89eb0289-9906-5fed-8dbf-75620ff6ab2b,10f12d5c-d05a-52d0-ae46-729c528928e5,1dcebf95-16c5-5f63-b778-c891877d5276","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Lyons","St. Vrain Canyons","South Fork of St. Vrain Canyon","Hobo Car, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.36,40.176]},"bbox":[-105.36058850935322,40.17555033981814,-105.35941149064679,40.176449660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107515373","area_id":"Hc6/lRbFX2O3eMiRh31Sdg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:39.621Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:42.811Z"}
