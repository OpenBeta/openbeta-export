It is s a bit of scramble getting to the crack, but this can be done nicely by starting a bit to the left. The crack has lots of good stances with fun moves between. The chain anchor gives a good TR to the thin crack on the right. My own impression was close to 5.9, but others call it 5.8, this may relate to how the climbing is  approached. The crack will take straight in jams (and wide) or lay-back up to a good stance at a similar level of difficulty.","protection":"Bring several wide camming units and some stoppers.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"N5L2e06HXam0feoA3J9WpA==","name":"Dead Raccoon Crack","yds":"5.4","grades":{"yds":"5.4","french":"4a"},"fa":"Jim Cormier, prior to or during the mid-'90s?","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3111,40.2037]},"left_right_index":16,"mp_id":"105751105","mp_crag_id":"105744935","climb_id":"N5L2e06HXam0feoA3J9WpA==","areaRef":"IoPe3R15U3q8UtM8VlJjyA=="},"content":{"description":"This is a great route to learn how to do tricky aid and some delicate nailing.
