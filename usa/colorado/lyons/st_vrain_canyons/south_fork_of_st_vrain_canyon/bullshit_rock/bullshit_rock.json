Locate next bolt near center, and continue up to small ledge. The next moves are very thin high step 11- if you stay on face, otherwise step right around corner for 10 climbing, then continue moving back left to the second ledge.\n\nClimb up a third tier starting in the middle trending right after 15-20 feet to an arete then to the top. When climbing on third tier, your belayer will typically not be able to see you and may believe you're at the top. You may want to remind them how much climbing is left.","protection":"A toprope.
