You may find a place to put #1-4 C4s.\n\nThe anchor seems to be in fair condition, but it's a chain and rap hook (i.e. two bolts).  The chain is not at the same height as the hook though, and the rap hook is closed too much to get much in, except perhaps 3mm cord, which doesn't help you.  After rap, it takes a bit more than the usual effort to pull.\n\nThe rating is due to the crux at the second bolt, which is a difficult section of slab, only a few slabby moves to get past.
