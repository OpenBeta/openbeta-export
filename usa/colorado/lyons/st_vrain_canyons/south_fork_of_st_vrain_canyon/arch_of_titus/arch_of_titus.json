After the second bolt, trend right along a crack that has a few plants growing out of it (nice #0.5 Camalot can be placed). Continue up the crack to a left-facing corner with gear. You will see a horizontal crack going out right just above this corner. Figure out how to travel along this horizontal crack over to a corner below the three intimidating roofs. Wild and beautiful moves get you through the roofs. Each roof has a bolt with the crux coming between roofs 1 and 2. After the roof moves, get a great rest, then head up a corner with a crack to another bolt over a bulge. Pull this, then finish with one more tricky move to the ledge and anchors.
