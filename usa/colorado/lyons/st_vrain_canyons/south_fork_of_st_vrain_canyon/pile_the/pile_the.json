The first bolt is about 10' off the ground.  Climb up and leftpast the first two bolts, gaining the clean slab.  Make some delicate moves up the slab, and continue to the seventh bolt.  Work left past a bulge (crux) and climb easily past two more bolts to the anchor.\n\nThe leader can belay from the anchor or lower/rappel 80' to the ground.\n\nTwo stars for clean rock, good moves, and airy position.\n\nPer\n\nJF M\n\n: start with a few easier moves past the first couple of red hangers; follow the line along the arete feature, then back left and up the slap to a fun, well-protected bulge (crux). Finish the route with a few more bolts and a few more slab-moves to the anchors.\n\nEds. this is a combination of 2 submissions, the first was submitted on a different crag.","protection":"9 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.  The route is 80' long; a 50m rope is OK.\n\nPer\n\nJF M\n\n: the anchor has one cold-shut and one hanger/chain combo.","location":"This route lies on the rock just left of the Sentinel, about 100' left of Alvino's Arete.  It follows a line of bolts with red hangers up the slab and arete on the right side of the rock.\n\nPer\n\nJF M\n\n: this route is located on the right side of the formation, about 30 feet from the bottom. Look for a series of red hangers.\n\nEither rap the route (climber's left of the little pine) or go climber's right of the tree down a crumbly face. Either way, a 60m rope will get to the ground.\n\nThe anchors may be accessed from the top of the formation also."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,74632cc0-a38c-534d-8344-0ada57f54a44,89eb0289-9906-5fed-8dbf-75620ff6ab2b,10f12d5c-d05a-52d0-ae46-729c528928e5,8b8bb991-519f-5b3c-9ea7-948229914fab","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Lyons","St. Vrain Canyons","South Fork of St. Vrain Canyon","Pile, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3334,40.1863]},"bbox":[-105.33398859870462,40.18585033981814,-105.33281140129536,40.18674966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108590301","area_id":"i4u5kVGfWzyep5SCKZFPqw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:39.613Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:25.789Z"}
