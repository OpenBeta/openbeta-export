As the location details, we started on the left side, going up to the horn then traversing right to the crack. Once at the crack, first step left and up, then make couple of steps right then up laybacking (LB). I had to perform some garden cleaning in the layback. At the high point of the LB, step right, and run it out to the horizontal.\n\nBegin the traverse right in the Hor crack placing your #3, #3.5, and saving the #4 for last. Go about 30 feet until the crack ends, around the corner and up. My last piece was the #4 in the crack a long way from the ledge. I suppose I could have placed a medium cam before going around the corner.\n\nThis was a real battle of a climb with long fall potential at the runouts.","protection":"SR + Camalots #4 (#3.5 at a minimum), RPs, and small 0 or 00 micro cam.","location":"This is on the South face below dark \"crack\" on left side of the overhang in the middle of the face.
