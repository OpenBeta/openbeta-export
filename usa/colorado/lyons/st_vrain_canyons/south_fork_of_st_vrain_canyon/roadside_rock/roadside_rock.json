The rock is solid, but a little dirty in places, and the slab before and after the roof can tend to be wet, which makes for excitement in the \"5.9\" micro-edging (which felt harder to me).\n\nClimb up past the first bolt on stems and off-angled holds with pro overhead, then clip another one and make a funky, balance move with long stems and reaches to head up and left onto a very thin face.  Faith in your footwork is a must to get on the slab and no less necessary once on it.  If the face is damp, staying right might be slightly tougher, but dry at least.  Head up and left, then back right just before the roof, using slightly longer slings on the bolts to prevent drag.  A few more damp holds may be found in a steep dark area near the 2-bolt belay, but at least the climbing is juggy.\n\nContinue up from that belay (stopping is optional) on more moderate climbing (5.8-) to the top of the rock and belay (again?). The finishing moves are on suspect looking puzzle-piece jugs that turned out to be surprisingly solid and fun.\n\nThere was plenty of rope left on our 70m after doing it as a single pitch, and a 60m would certainly reach.  a 50m might or might not.\n\nTo descend, scramble down and left to a bolt and chain anchor as for '\n\nLeft Side\n\n' and rap 30m into the bottom of a gully, then walk back to the base of the climb on sloping terrian.","protection":"If done in one pitch, a dozen or more slings plus a light rack of cams for gear between placements on occasion.","location":"This climb lies on the South edge of the East face of the rock, on the corner facing the Road. You are far enough around the corner that Tom Turkey and Sweat Loaf crags are plainly visible.\n\nScramble down and left from the South face around a corner to find a bolted line going more up less up the blunt arete.  The line starts up, heads left under thebig roof, then back right and up to a bolted anchor near a tree, then on to the top."},"__v":0},{"_id":"M6C3D/ylVuC/UeMDVihaAA==","name":"Drop Your Cool, Tom Foolery","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Joseph Grubb and Alvino Pon, 2003","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3334,40.1863]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106340479","mp_crag_id":"105745199","climb_id":"M6C3D/ylVuC/UeMDVihaAA==","areaRef":"EYLOTfayXeawiBm111CCSg=="},"content":{"description":"This forced line follows the face to the left of \"\n\nLeft Side\n\n, 5.8\".
