It is a pump, and the crack exit is no piece of cake.\n\nTraverse the ledge to the right and begin a series of crimpers and sidepulls diagonaling right. Traverse back left at the 11c crux which isn't much harder than what you've just climbed. From the last bolt, move up and left, get to the holds below the anchors, switch feet, and try and make the clip. Good luck!
