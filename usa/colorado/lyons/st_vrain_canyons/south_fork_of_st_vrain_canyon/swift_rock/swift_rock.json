The chipped hold (a broken out section of rock in a shallow corner to create a solid 1\" edge) is indeed out of character for the route overall but takes the route from being potentially VERY hard to being relatively moderate but still insecure. A reachy crux follows, one that would be very hard for short climbers, reaching to the distant arete.\n\nOnce on the arete, continue up easier climbing to the top, where a 2-bolt anchor is set over a large ledge. Rap 85' from this anchor, as lowering will be tough on your rope, owing to said ledge.","protection":"A dozen draws and slings.

The first ascent team gained the base of the crack by traversing up and right from the crag's lowpoint, staying below the low roofband, but the crack is probably best accessed by walking up the west gully to where it is convenient to step out onto the main face at a good stance.\n\nThe crack is about thirty feet long with tricky protection.  The crux is near the end and is slightly runout.  Finish with nice, much easier climbing up a few parallel cracks.
