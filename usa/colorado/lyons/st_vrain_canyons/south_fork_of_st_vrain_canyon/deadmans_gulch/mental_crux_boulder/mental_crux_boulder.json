It's technically easy, but it's also tall, exposed, and beautiful.\n\nThe rock took a little cleaning but is fairly solid. The colorful lichen isn't really an issue for climbing, it just added aesthetics.\n\nA more complete problem could start from the ground instead of the shelf but would be a bit contrived.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I just moved to the area, so am not sure if I'm the first one to climb this route. Please suggest a correction if you have better info. I just didn't see any signs of cleaning or chalk when I climbed it. Also, I'm not much for grading. No promises on the V1 mark.","protection":"A couple pads and spotters would be nice.  If you only have a single pad, I'd put it on the ground on the downhill side of the wave, not on the starter shelf.","location":"On the south side of the wave, there's an obvious starter shelf. Stand-start here, and climb the wave using the left edge and the crack system. You could find other routes on this boulder, but this is the obvious one."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,74632cc0-a38c-534d-8344-0ada57f54a44,89eb0289-9906-5fed-8dbf-75620ff6ab2b,10f12d5c-d05a-52d0-ae46-729c528928e5,5c8a87b0-e1f5-578e-ac8f-0997ee12ca3d,dacc021d-eecb-568e-8042-86e2997c682a","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Lyons","St. Vrain Canyons","South Fork of St. Vrain Canyon","Deadman's Gulch","Mental Crux Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.32395,40.20416]},"bbox":[-105.32453875374772,40.203710339818144,-105.3233612462523,40.204609660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112083011","area_id":"2swCHe7LVo6AQobimXxoKg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:39.632Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:43.069Z"}
