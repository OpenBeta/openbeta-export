Start on a jug at the bottom of the arete problem and follow the path of least resistance across the wall using good holds most of the way. The hardest moves come near the end and by all means pad up that boulder in the middle.\n\nI'm sure myriad variations exist to this traverse but by taking the path of greatest resistance at the start by staying low, the grade is probably bumped up to about V7. It also involves a cool and powerful throw to get back to the regular traverse.\n\nWhen I first saw this boulder I thought \"Man, what a pile.\" But it's actually alright.
