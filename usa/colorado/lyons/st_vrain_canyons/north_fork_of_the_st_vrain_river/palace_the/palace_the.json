Gain the top of the crack on the left side by pinching the the horn 10c with tape, harder without tape.\n\nPast a stance, continue with traverse in a right-leaning crack, a #3 or #2 Camalot is a nice addition here. Continue traversing the crack a short way until the crack starts to go around corner & offers a good sinker. Place a good Alien or similar, find small feet/smear, and using an undercling, walk upir feet up high until you can slap the horizontal feeling around for the crack that you will want to put another Alien into.
