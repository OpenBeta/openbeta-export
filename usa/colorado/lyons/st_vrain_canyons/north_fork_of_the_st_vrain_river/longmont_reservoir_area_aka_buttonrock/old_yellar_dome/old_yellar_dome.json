It was originally bolted by the legendary Steve Hong and Pat Adams, much thanks!\n\nThe route is broken into 3 parts by 2 no hands rests. Once past the hollow and kinda chossy entry climbing, you get to a very techy, 12+ dihedral (I extended the 3rd draw to make it safer to clip). Once past the dihedral, you get to a ledge big enough you can walk around on, have a party, take a nap,\n\netc.\n\nFrom here, you have a steep, undercling traverse on good holds eventually pulling a tricky bulge onto a hanging slab and another no hands rest. Finally you have reached the crux, probably a V6 on its own. Very sequential and perplexing, this took me some good sussing to actually figure out a method through the last 2 bolts. The route finishes with a jump to the finish jug on\n\nOld Yellar\n\n, what a stellar last move! It shares an anchor with\n\nOld Yellar\n\nand is a pain to clean while lowering. I would TR back up through the draws.\n\nOverall, the route has subpar rock quality and is broken up by 2 no hands rests, but if you have already done\n\nOld Yellar\n\n, this is definitely worth getting on. It is very different.","protection":"Bolts with a sport anchor (shared with\n\nOld Yellar\n\n).","location":"Start 10 feet to the right of\n\nOld Yellar\n\n."},"__v":0},{"_id":"fr6I/uqEXdKVQNxe33ieeA==","name":"Old Yellar","yds":"5.13a","grades":{"yds":"5.13a","french":"7c+"},"fa":"[S.
