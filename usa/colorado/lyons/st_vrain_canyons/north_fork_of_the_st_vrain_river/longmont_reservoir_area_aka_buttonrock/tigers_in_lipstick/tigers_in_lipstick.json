Follow a leaning finger crack into a dihedral and up over some grovelly stone.  The crack itself is surprisingly clean and the size is consistent (this route could easily be led with a single set of nuts and some runners).  The crux of this route lay in the region of the dihedral where the right face is relatively clean and the only good purchase for feet can be found in the crack itself.  Belay at the top - for the belay, you may need some larger pieces (but a cordelette slung around a rock of tree should be sufficient).\n\nTo descend, wade down the gully on the right through the detrius (boots would be good as the dead material is sufficiently deep that you will sink into it).","protection":"","location":"This line is located immediately across from Longmont Resevoir on the left side of the road about 0.25 mi from the gate (just past the dam)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,74632cc0-a38c-534d-8344-0ada57f54a44,89eb0289-9906-5fed-8dbf-75620ff6ab2b,54d59106-7c50-5090-a31c-a08615f50b44,6b5a0ff1-9564-5731-a585-e5e0b58b4bd3,142993f7-a64f-560e-af92-2026543743c7","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Lyons","St. Vrain Canyons","North Fork of the St. Vrain River","Longmont Reservoir Area (aka Buttonrock)","Tigers in Lipstick"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.34545,40.2291]},"bbox":[-105.34603897048493,40.228650339818145,-105.34486102951507,40.22954966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106432389","area_id":"FCmT96ZPVg6vkiAmVDdDxw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:24.912Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:26.916Z"}
