There are 2 easy sections of 4th Class between pitches 1-2 and 2-3. The rest is fine, moderate quartzite climbing with an awesome 5.10 last pitch.\n\nPitch 1. 5.9. Start from the large pine tree at the base of Misfits Wall. Head for the A-frame break in the overlap above (crux), 7 bolts + 2 bolt rappel anchor - clip this anchor on the way by and keep going over 4th Class terrain above to anchor at the base of the wall behind a huge pine tree.\n\nPitch 2. 5.8. Follow 6 bolts up amazing face. You can get an optional fingers to mid-size cam midway.\n\nVar.\n\nLondon Dungeon\n\nclimbs the obvious, left-facing corner to the right. It is steep and awkward with powerful smearing. Face the wrong way, and it will feel like you've been put on the rack! 4 bolts, #0.5/0.75 Camalot.\n\nPitch 3. 5.4. Step out of belay nook, and go left towards the gully across slabs/corners with 1 bolt, then 4th Class up to large ledge system with rappel anchor on wall.\n\nPitch 4. 5.9. Start just to the right of the obvious gully following 6 bolts up good rock. A finger cam after last bolt gets you up to a 2 bolt belay in V-slot.\n\nPitch 5. 5.9+. Mantel out of V slot, up across slab to bolts on wall. 4 bolts lead up through some shite rock and some good rock...it will get your attention. A finger cam protects after the bolts and leads up to 2 bolt anchor at the base of a ramp and the headwall.\n\nPitch 6. 5.10. Start up corner/ramp to the right placing wide hands/hands cams to reach 3 bolts on the wall. Pure enjoyment follows as you surmount the headwall through the railroad tracks, but you got to find the holds first! A finger cam over the lip, and a higher bolt gets you to the anchor on top.\n\nVar. 5.7 R. Continue up ramp passing bolts, turn corner, and continue back left to summit.\n\nRappel the route. A 60 meter rope can make all the rappels except down pitch 4, but you can step into the gully and downclimb if you need to. Be careful on the awkward sideways rap on pitch 3, especially in the rain.","protection":"7-8 quickdraws and a few cams from fingers to #3 Camalot.","location":"Approach as for Waterfall Wall/\n\nPrincess Ella's....\n\nContinue past the start of PEMA 30 yds until you reach a fixed hand line.
