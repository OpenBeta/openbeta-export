Continuing straight up is 10c and is called Birds Eye View. Climb past pockets to moderate terrain.  Another tricky section at the top is encountered by a bonsai pine tree.  The rock on the bottom of the route is a little crumbly at times, but the climbing is super fun, the holds are good, and the position is nice.  The direct start is a bouldery 12c.","protection":"Bolts to a 2 bolt anchor.  Standard sport climbing fare.","location":"The Overlook cliff is directly above the Ouray Ice Park.\n\nDrive south out of Ouray on US Highway 550. After the first switchback, take a right towards Yankee Boy Basin and Camp Bird Mine. Drive 0.4 miles and park on your right. There should be a Sutton Mine Trailhead sign on your left. Follow the Sutton Mine Trail for 0.5 miles to the Ouray Overlook. Don't make the mistake of bee lining straight to the cliff once you see it from the trail. It is very steep and you'll have to hike around several smaller cliff bands.\n\nFrom the Ouray Overlook, go right along a faint trail following the ridgeline to the base of the cliff.
