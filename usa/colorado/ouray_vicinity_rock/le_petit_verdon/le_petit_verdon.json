Walk up a couple switchbacks until you reach a sign for the Oak Creek/Twin Peaks trailhead.  Continue walking south west on the 4WD road.

To get to the base of the cliff, you can down climb or make a short rappel from trees at the eastern end of the cliff.  The route is on the eastern end of the cliff and climbs black and grey limestone.  Like most of the area, there's potential for more routes depending on how much cleaning you want to do.
