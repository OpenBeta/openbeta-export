The first few clips move through easy terrain to get you warmed up for the hard part. After clipping the third bolt, you have to navigate slopey and thin climbing with good footwork. Small breaks on positive holds break up the slab and give opportunities to clip bolts. This is very techy and will require problem solving skills to get a clean ascent. This route is similar to\n\nThe Spine\n\non Haus Rock but shorter and more sustained.\n\nI understand that the route can easily be set up on toprope, but I still left chains for convenience and safety. Please don't be the jerk that steals fixed gear! There are a lot of flakes on this climb that are slowly peeling away from the wall. I have gotten most of them, but Iâ€™m sure some will come off with time. One current flake serves as a very useful hold near the third bolt. If this peels off, it will be significantly harder. I would recommend helmets and maybe having the belayer out of the line of fire.","protection":"5 tan/orange bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with chains.","location":"This is the only route on the wall.
