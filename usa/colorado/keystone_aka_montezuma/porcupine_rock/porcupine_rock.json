The route starts out in a flat alcove belay area that has 2 other bolted lines. The first pitch moves over some blocks which give way to slab climbing on the way to the anchor. The second pitch continues up the slab and over 2 roofs and continues on to a more vertical top section just before the anchors. The third pitch is meant as a way for climbers to top out if they want to. With only a couple of bolts and 5.6 climbing it is only worth doing for the view.\n\nThe second bolted line joins the 2nd pitch of this line for the continuation.\n\nUse caution, this has been extensively cleaned, but it is still a very new route. Loose rocks will come off when climbing this!\n\nThis needs more climbers on it to clean some of the lichen and loose rock.","protection":"Bolts with chain anchors at each pitch.","location":"Once you reach the base of Porcupine Rock from the trail, head up and right into a flat alcove like belay area.\n\nPer\n\nRick Karden\n\n: Porcupine Rock is the large rock face that you can see on the left just after turning onto the Montezuma Road. The best way to reach the base of Porcupine is to park across from it and walk West down the bike path towards Keystone. Look for a trail heading off the bike path just past the power tower. Follow the mining cut/trail until you run into the screefield and the cut ends. Turn left up the hill at this point onto the switchbacking trail.
