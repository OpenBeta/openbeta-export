Most likely, it pushes the upper side of V10 (or way more if you cannot manage the bunchy beta), but TJ neglected to opine on the rating and no one else has been able to send it.\n\nThe established stand start begins after the initial crux: left hand in the pockety edge at about 5 feet and any crimp or undercling next to or beneath it.\n\n*Expect the top out holds to need cleaning.  Once established on the slab, carefully walk your way to the right and down jump where the hillside rises up.  Very dirty and seeping features and loose rock await if you attempt to summit the next 40 feet of slab instead of escaping out right.","protection":"A decent assortment of pads.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"rogJnOInUpuhuKbm6SYc3A==","name":"Act of Aggression","yds":"V8","grades":{"yds":"V8","font":"7B","vscale":"V8"},"fa":"J.
