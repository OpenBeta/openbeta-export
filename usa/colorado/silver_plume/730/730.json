Tape up, and grunt your way up this shallow, left-leaning offwidth. The exciting crux section starts where the offwidth peters out, and you have to reach high and left to get back into the crack. From here, climb up, then follow the hand crack traverse right to the dihedral. Climb up a lower angle but tricky finger crack, and you'll see the anchors.\n\nI found a bail nut 15' up in the dihedral below where my route intersects. I also found a rusty old piton buried in dirt at the base of this route. It was sunk in a downward direction, which makes me think it was used to anchor mining equipment.","protection":"Here's the rack that I brought, this all felt well protected: 0.3-3; 2 # 4s; 3 # 5s; and a #6.\n\nThere is a two bolt anchor at the top with a rap ring. A 60m rope will get you to the ground.","location":"From the 7:30 mine shaft, hike down the mine tailings. This route is a few hundred feet down and is on the obvious rock face immediately to the West. The offwitdth is easy to spot, because it is splitter, and you can't miss it. There is a left-facing dihedral to the right of the crack.\n\nHiking down the tailings one person at a time is advisable due to the loose rock.\n\nYou can get a good view of this crag in its entirety if you look to the West from the Griffin Memorial."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,0006c9c8-b1a0-5148-b81b-6ecf445a269b,8af22c04-6684-57d0-9139-5fe661f41445","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Silver Plume","7:30"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.74229,39.7025]},"bbox":[-105.74287445117217,39.702050339818136,-105.74170554882784,39.702949660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121840366","area_id":"ivIsBGaEV9CROV/mYfQURQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.74287445117217,39.702050339818136],[-105.74170554882784,39.702050339818136],[-105.74170554882784,39.702949660181865],[-105.74287445117217,39.702949660181865],[-105.74287445117217,39.702050339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:08.481Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:38.046Z"}
