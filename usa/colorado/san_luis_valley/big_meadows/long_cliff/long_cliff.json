A number of the holds are huge, guillotine-like flakes that scared the crap out of me. Even though the initial climbing was easy, I stickclipped the first by and had my belayer stand well to the side. My belayer had to continue to shift position to stay out of the potential drop zone. The crux is not one you want to fall on due to bolt placement. Also, the rock quality is poorer than normal on this cliff.\n\nThe climb consists of moderate climbing through B3 with a 5.9ish move to clip B4. Then there is a pretty intriguing sequence to get to B5. Be careful as a fall in the crux will result in a pendulum and possibly the loss of some skin on the rock bulge near B4. The crux requires nailing a dyno to a hollow sidepull at B5 - unnerving. After that, it backs off to the anchors.\n\nIf you climb this and care about your belayer, make sure they are never below you. If one of the many large hollow holds rips, they will appreciate not being in the fall line.\n\nI don't know the FA or the route name.
