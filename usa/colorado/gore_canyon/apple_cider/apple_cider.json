This is an incredible, but short pitch. Head slightly left, then climb the bomber cracks up to the small pinnacle above.

Head for the small tree.","protection":"There is poor protection on P1 low down. P2 protects really well with #0.75-#3. P3 protects fairly well and is on easy terrain.\n\nThe anchor is at the tree (a sling and two draws). You need TWO 60m ropes to rappel. Examine the tree before rappelling.
