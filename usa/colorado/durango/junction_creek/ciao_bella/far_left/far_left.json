A left to right traverse is spookier for the second due to a short section of down climbing. To facilitate communicating, belay mid-way under the large roof off of a bolt and a #2.5 Friend, although there are other stances to set an anchor.\n\nGain the dirt belay ledge. Climb big holds up and then right across a flake to a bolt, cross Genevieve the Jewel, and move past this with good pro and edges to a stance / bolt. [Here one can climb up and onto the last part of Brigitte and anchors.} Girth hitch some natural pro and downclimb right to a ledge / bolt. Then down again to difficult climbing right under a bulge with pretty white poo on nice fins past bolts and pro to a stance in a corner under the large roof. From here, up just a bit on small edges to belay at the bolt and a #2.5 Friend for an anchor. Continue past to another bolt near a hollow flake with questionable pro. Then continue right on good holds under a roof and around a corner to more bolts / pro. From here, step down to reach a large white flake with good pro. Undercling across to a right facing corner and more FP. Then its an easy slab across to stance and anchor. Lower to the ground off this anchor or belay. This stance is part of the dihedral of Petra's Preference.","protection":"Long slings and pro ranging from small wires to a #4 Camalot.
