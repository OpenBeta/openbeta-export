Follow it up lower-angled rock, all the way to the big ponderosa pine that is visible on the top. It climbs better than it looks.\n\nIn June, 2011, I led my wife, Jeana, up this. She left a #6 Stopper about halfway up. On Sept. 27, 2016, I followed Jarrod Keller up the route. The nut was there and easy to remove. I infer that no one has climbed the route since 6/11, and I believe that no one had climbed it before.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":"It is about 100 feet up to the south, along the base of the slabs."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,02e602df-28d4-5855-a2c9-cf88fb257589,ba15baf5-a18f-5e8f-84f3-1f2d0fbebfd6,d421b583-fc2b-5eef-aeed-c3b58208c227","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Durango","Vallecito Crags","Slippery Slope, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.53691,37.47822]},"bbox":[-107.53747661902098,37.47777033981814,-107.53634338097905,37.478669660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112191032","area_id":"1CG1g/wrXu+u7cO1ggjCJw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.53747661902098,37.47777033981814],[-107.53634338097905,37.47777033981814],[-107.53634338097905,37.478669660181865],[-107.53747661902098,37.478669660181865],[-107.53747661902098,37.47777033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:49.284Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:39.212Z"}
