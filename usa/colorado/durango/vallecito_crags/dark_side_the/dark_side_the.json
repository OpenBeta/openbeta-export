The crack angles on the left side of the wall. A tricky crux down low leads to secure jamming or nice edging and laybacking. The route breaks up nicely into two pitches. From the top of the first pitch anchor, climb straight up on easy terrain protected by gear for about 30 feet. Climb under an obvious roof, and clip a bolt at the lip of the roof. From there, pull the roof, and climb the face up and right through the steepest / best looking rock straight up to the anchors that you first rapped from. Bolts and a single set of cams protect the second pitch. Both pitches are 100' long.","protection":"A single rack of Cams up to a #3, 1 set of Aliens, 1 set of nuts, and quickdraws.
