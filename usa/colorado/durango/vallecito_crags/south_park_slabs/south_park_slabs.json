The rappel is easiest with two 70 meter ropes, but can also be done with a single 60. To start the rap, find the tree with a black rap anchor on it. If using two 70s, rap to The Broken Bit Saloon ledge. From the ledge, rap to the ground. If you are using a single 60m or 70m, you will have to make five raps using the intermediate anchors."},"__v":0},{"_id":"9wBF3vU6XmKMLBPz0Qf4ug==","name":"Oh My God, They Drilled Kenny!","yds":"5.8+","grades":{"yds":"5.8+","french":"5b"},"fa":"JM, JM","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.53766,37.47903]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106283037","mp_crag_id":"106271603","climb_id":"9wBF3vU6XmKMLBPz0Qf4ug==","areaRef":"4+VV71rSWgy9gbSb2UGjrg=="},"content":{"description":"A new set of anchors have been added to rap down this route with one 60m rope.
