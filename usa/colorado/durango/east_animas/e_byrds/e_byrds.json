I really don't remember. You climb the choss gully to climbers left of Angel Dust, then head up to a giant bolt. It is hard to see the bolt from the ground, but it is up there. The next piece of pro is a beaten in copperhead that looks like it is from the dinosaur era. Climb over the overhang and traverse right which is run out for the leader and follower, to another dirty crack. Then, the leader climbs up the crack and does a sketchy traverse out left to the sick, overhanging, hands to fist crack. I thought I was going to be the first person to climb this route in years, but when I got to the crack it was perfectly clean. It is an incredible crack pitch at East Animas, with its exposure and sustained crack climbing. The crack is much cleaner than Slave's Crack, which receives a lot more traffic.\n\nPer\n\nDancesatmoonrise\n\n:\n\nThe FA was by Johnny Duran. He showed it to Jim DiNapoli in 1984 and gave DiNapoli the lead. After yo-yo'ing the overhanging crack out of sheer fright, DiNapoli flamed out turning the top, Duran finished the lead, DiNapoli finished on second.\n\nIn those days, Duran used to regularly do the Watch Crystal wearing nothing but gym shorts, a chalk bag, a Walkman, and a rack with one stopper. The stopper was to put in at the belay to bring his GF up.","protection":"Standard East A rack.\n\nPer\n\nBen Griffin\n\nThis route can now be done in one pitch. There are now 3 bolts protecting the face of this rock climb and two bolts for a belay.
