I just looked up at the steep, beautiful, colorful arÃªte that shot straight up in the sky. It was like looking at a pathway to heaven. I was sitting in the great hall of Odin (a great legendary god). I felt the presence of late, great climbing partner Jimmy Forester and my late nephew who grew as a climber and person before being taken from us. Both of them fought the great battle of life. As I sat there, I could see holds to start appearing. I asked a good friend Matt King to help me put this route up. I wanted to put it up ground up, but it was so steep and nothing to hook. So I rapped in only to realize that after a short rappel I was out in space. So I heel hooked and basically downclimbed/ rappelled in to install each bolt. After ab crushing and bicep pumping work, we had all the bolts in except 1 at the start of the traverse. Matt tried to pull me in but no way. We had to climb\n\nSweeney's Special\n\n, and I tensioned way out left to install the last bolt as to make sure it did not take away the\n\nSweeney's Special\n\nadventure. 6 tries later each with a biceps and forearm pumping attempt we have Valhalla: where warriors who die as heroes and legends in battle dwell eternally.

It ascends the face and prow directly to the left and 1/3 of the way up\n\nApple Cider\n\n.\n\nThere are four ways to start this route. I will describe in more detail what will likely be the most common way to do the route.\n\nClimb the flake up into the small cave on Apple Cider, and place a piece with a runner. Pull out and over the small cave, and head towards the finger crack on the left. Place your 3\" piece firmly in the wider crack to keep the rope running smooth. You should be getting nice and warmed up now.\n\nHead left, placing another piece in the finger crack, towards the first bolt. Pull some delicate and balancy moves to get the blood flowing.\n\nClip the first draw with a runner. Follow the path of least resistance, curving slightly out left and then back in. They do this sometimes. Continue following the bolts to the top. There are a few good spots to rest and take it nice and slow on the way up.\n\nThe crux cums as you near the tip of the prow. Find yourself in a very exposed position as you pull over the last bulge and bust it out left to finish on the nice big ledge.\n\nNote: this route can also be done by starting on The\n\nContortionist\n\n,\n\nCrimpin' and Pimpin'\n\n, or\n\nChingadero\n\n.","protection":"If doing the\n\nApple Cider\n\nstart, I suggest, in BD C4 sizes, a 0.3, 3, 0.4, all with runners. From there, use 1 runner on the first bolt and 6 more quickdraws to the top.\n\nA 60m rope works just fine.\n\nIf linking in from one of the other sport routes, bring draws for that route and a single or double length runner for the anchor plus 5 or 6 more draws to the top.","location":"This is in the\n\nApple Cider\n\narea.\n\nEither start on\n\nApple Cider\n\nor one of those hard AF sporto routes to the left."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,02e602df-28d4-5855-a2c9-cf88fb257589,aa7b9a02-977d-5d53-a1f0-c1d50038f7e0,e0e8f3ff-a42d-5184-9127-ea7dab1202fe","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Durango","East  Animas","G.
