Traverse climber's left through many boulder problems no harder than V4 or V5. The traverse climbs like a route, so expect it to be more like a 12d/13a with defined rest in it. It ends on a big, flat jug before the mega hard extension called\n\nGolden Arms\n\n. This traverse is incredible and absolutely a Sailing Hawks classic. So, if you can't find a rope partner, this is the next best thing.\n\nFor the locals, we're starting a speed trail. Why not? Try to do sacred as fast as you can. As of 12/5/15, I was able to do the whole traverse in 2 minutes 16 seconds. Nolan Robertson and Erik Durgin destroyed my time shortly afterwards.

It has amazing rock quality and fluid movement. This monster of endurance and power has roughly 7 cruxes ranging from V5-V7. There are several rests, some easy to utilize, some teasingly bad. Overall, it is an amazing feat to link it.\n\nIt is one of my favorite climbing accomplishments, and it is really fun to climb 100+ feet of sustained difficult cruxes without having to clip!
