A move or two establishes you above the small shelf, and then it is straightforward steep crimping on decent edges. You could start a bit lower - that appears to be significantly harder. I was told it is V6, thought it could be easy for that, so V5/6 it is for now.\n\nIt does seem a little sketchy with the rock behind you, but with a pad and a spot, I think it is safe.","protection":"","location":"This is at the far right side of the boulderfield.
