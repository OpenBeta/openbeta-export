The start was an overhanging seam/crack, which led to good cracks in the vertical face. After about 95 feet, I reached a juniper and abseiled. Tim cleaned on jumars. We left the rope fixed, so we could finish the route on the following day. David Kozak's 1985\n\nSOUTHWEST ROCK\n\ncalls this pitch \"The Old, Bad and Ugly Nail-up.\" He says that there is a two-bolt belay. There were no bolts when we were there. He doesn't mention a second pitch.\n\nThe following day, we jumared the fixed rope. Tim led the second pitch, using aid in the rain. The second pitch went up a nice crack in a vertical, left-facing dihedral and could go free at 5.10 or 11. The lower pitch could go free, except for (perhaps) the start.","protection":"I used pitons on the first section, and nuts and pitons above. Cams hadn't been invented.
