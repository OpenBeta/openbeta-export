I may try to head back up and see if there is a more direct start.

Mmmmm mmmmm.\n\nFrom the approach trail, you can see the massive cave in the massive dihedral. This is what you're looking for. Start up the massive dihedral in-between '\n\nNo Country For Old Men\n\n' and '\n\nNuggernaut\n\n'. After a full rope length, you'll see a red sling with a quick-link on it. I belayed on the huge ledge to the right.\n\nFrom here, we moved the belay more to the right, about 30'. There was an exposed step around to a small stance to get started again. Be sure to head right here. Do not continue up towards the purple sling a short distance up. Head on up, trending slightly right perhaps. This pitch ended with a small overhang in a v-slot like feature.\n\nAt this point, I remember heading up a short crack in a blocky, right-facing dihedral and making a step around left. I continued heading up, doing some face climbing. I finished this pitch after another small overhang.\n\n1.5 to 2 more pitches of fun face climbing up and slightly left will put you at the base of Da Cherry on Top! This is the money pitch.

Get on up this thing, and you'll be right near the rappel route, and the summit.\n\nDescent - follow cairns from the summit southeast-ish to a bolted rap anchor. Make one single rope rap to a large tree with webbing. From here, make a double rope rap to a small, singular tree with webbing. Another double rope rap will get you to a bolt and fixed nut (webbing/cord could use an update). From here, make a double rope rap to a large terrace with a two bolt anchor. One more double rope rap will get you to the base of the Nuggernaut.
