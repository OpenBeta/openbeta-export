Climb past 2 bolts to the base of a roof feature. At the roof, locate two key pockets, one at the bottom and one at the top. Follow a series of pockets through the roof and slightly right after the roof. Finagle your way to the last bolt (currently a quickdraw on this bolt, soon to be a chain perma-draw), and rest from a stance. Fire through the crux to a jug, and pull over the bulge. After the bulge, climb dirty, insecure slopers and crimps on low angle terrain to the anchor.","protection":"Bolts.","location":"This is on the face behind and left of the spire."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,02e602df-28d4-5855-a2c9-cf88fb257589,593dc6b2-2670-5f6c-8bc9-27d42bac95e2,3732be3b-fe4b-5393-86fc-f1ee5516cbb3","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Durango","Fume Wall","Fume Wall North"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.80389,37.46098]},"bbox":[-107.80445648835604,37.46053033981814,-107.80332351164392,37.461429660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111683819","area_id":"NzK+O/5LU5OG/PHuVRbLsw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.80445648835604,37.46053033981814],[-107.80332351164392,37.46053033981814],[-107.80332351164392,37.461429660181864],[-107.80445648835604,37.461429660181864],[-107.80445648835604,37.46053033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:50.457Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:10.286Z"}
