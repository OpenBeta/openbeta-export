Start at the bottom of the big offwidth crack, and start climbing up it and into it until you get to where the crack starts to tighten. Move deeper into the crack, and chimney your way up through the crack until you finagle your way out of the top of the rock. It's a tight squeeze, and a fall would be painful. This route is not for the claustrophobic, as you may have to control your breathing just to squeeze through the gaps. The further left (into) the rock you go, the wider it is and the easier it is to maneuver, but it's tight throughout.","protection":"","location":"When you enter the Mushroom Ridge area, you should spot a massive rock up at the top that kind of towers over everything else.
