Make a move to a good angling hold with your left, set your feet, then try not to barn-door off as you make a committing move to a good horizontal hold with your right hand. Reach up with your left to find a good undercling, find a high left foot and smear your right in order to make the crux move. Alternately, make a far reach out left to pinch the lip, set your feet, then move to the undercling. Once set, throw for a good crimp with your right hand. Stick the throw, then utilize good side clings and a heel hook to pull the lip, and continue up the face to top out. This part can be tricky and a little high, a crash pad is recommended. The rock and holds are of good quality, though other parts of the same boulder this cannot be said of. Great problem.","protection":"Crash pad recommended.","location":"This ascends the large boulder roughly straight south back into the woods across the river from the pullout.
