After the first two bolts, you can get into what looks (as of 2020) like a mountain lion's den, so be careful of that, but then you're super stable and can hang out and plan your moves. The next few bolts are a bit scary, being on exposed slab, and can be a bit pumpy to clip. Near the top, you can swing wide right and take a quick break before the anchors, or you can go straight up the roof to get them. Alternately, you can try to get up through the offwidth crack to the right of the slab, but clipping is much harder from there.","protection":"Quickdraws and an anchor at the top.","location":"Walk about a mile up Mad Creek trail, and keep an eye out on your left for large rock features. Eventually you will come upon a slab with some bolts going up it. Lion's Den is to the left of that, and the first 2 bolts look they're on their own on a boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"iPUxti5bXGWAvELrN0o1Iw==","name":"Keep It Greasy","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.88077,40.57123]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119851722","mp_crag_id":"119851524","climb_id":"iPUxti5bXGWAvELrN0o1Iw==","areaRef":"5UacikqNV9GFeWphZPvJkg=="},"content":{"description":"If anyone knows the FA, grade, and real name of this route, let me know!\n\nGoing up the big, obvious slab, the feet are somewhat sparse. There's a small roof about 2/3 of the way up, and getting to that roof is probably the crux as the feet run out and the holds aren't great. After the roof, it's a bit reachy, but the holds are solid, and the top hold is massive and positive, and, if you want, you can climb up on top of it to get off the wall. I think it's possible to set the anchor as a toprope without leading it, but I've never tried.\n\nGoing out left gives you more options for crimps, so it may be easier to get up that way, but then the clips are out of reach, so I recommend only doing that on toprope.","protection":"Quickdraws and anchors at the top.","location":"Walk about a mile up Mad Creek Trail, and the route should be obvious on your left (uphill side).
