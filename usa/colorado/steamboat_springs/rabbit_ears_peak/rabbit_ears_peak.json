The back of the Rabbit is the first section of rock you see at the top of the trail. Several different easier routes head up steep, loose trails to wide cracks that lead through the vertical, technical section of the easiest summit climbs. After 30 to 40 feet of chimney wide crack systems, a large ledge provides a belay stance for the rest of the party. A 3rd class scramble ascends for the remaining 50 to 60 feet to the summit.\n\n3 to 4 hour (grade III) round trip from the gate parking lot.","protection":"A rope would be a great way to protect this unpredictable conglomerate, volcanic pumice glued together with what appears to be remaining limestone minerals and fossils.\n\nA 10m section of tape, webbing, or spectra for belay anchor, large hexes (small nuts are hard to trust), several slings, etc....","location":"Directly at the end of the approach trail you will see the obvious lines that head up to the top of the \"Back of the Rabbit.\" Other routes, ranging from 120 feet (40m), follow cracks up the back of the rabbit or up the two towers that make up the Rabbit Ears!"},"__v":0},{"_id":"e00NhBUsWWqzaCPp/v3zjA==","name":"East Rabbit Ear","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.6293,40.29096]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119348046","mp_crag_id":"106841437","climb_id":"e00NhBUsWWqzaCPp/v3zjA==","areaRef":"PntzOQdhXJGtp+Ys834g2w=="},"content":{"description":"This is a true Choss Master classic. This route climbs the crack on the east side of the east ear - the true summit verified with a level. The rock quality is horrific, but at least the gear is acceptable. Complete a short mantel, and climb a semi-overhanging section through a red rock band which has the worst rock quality. Improving rock quality then leads to a ledge where a 4th Class scramble then leads to the summit.\n\nI blew a large rock and fell, so any edge/rock/foot/hand cannot be trusted.\n\nA single 50m rope rappel from a good block on the summit gets you back to the ground.","protection":"A double rack #0.3-3 and a single #4 (new BD).
