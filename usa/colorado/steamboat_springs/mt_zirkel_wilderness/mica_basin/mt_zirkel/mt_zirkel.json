Zirkel, Big Agnes saddle. It is the cleanest and longest buttress north of the saddle.\n\nP1. Climb the clean face, moving left over loose rock to a belay (5.6). One could climb up the clean face to avoid loose rock. Protection above looks grim, though the rock looks okay.\n\nP2. Class 4 to exposed ridge.\n\nP3-4. Move up easy exposed ridge to the base of a rightward traverse to and overhang.\n\nP5. (crux) Climb the traverse (5.9) to steep crack (5.10ish) with some lichen stemming. If this pitch got cleaned up, it would be excellent.\n\nP6. Move right under choss-filled chimneys think after two one finds passage into clean corner to bulge rope stretcher! (5.6)\n\nP7. Climb bulge to cracks (5.7).\n\nP8. Similar to P7, stretch rope.\n\nP8-10. Follow the ridge up.
