Follow this gully to a ledge about 20 feet higher. This would be a good spot to belay. From the ledge, follow a thin crack system aiming up and right for the obvious, wide crack.

You may want to belay in the chimney above on small gear unless you have a big piece left. From the chimney, move right again to the twin cracks leading to a ramp up and left.
