There are kind of 3 cruxes with rest holds in between. You may want stick clip the first bolt cause the move off the ground is tricky, but only if your into that. Getting through the X in the rock is the first crux. Get up onto the blocks and have a nice shake out before embarking on the finger crack. Once you are through that you have the choice of a awkward move through the roof or a 5.7 ramp to the left.","protection":"9 bolts, I think.
