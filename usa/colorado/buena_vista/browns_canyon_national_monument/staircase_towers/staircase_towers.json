This small section of crack is the crux. After the 20' feet of vertical hand crack, you come to a 30' traverse along a beautiful section of rock where it creates a large seam and there are knobs all over and great holds. You come to a last 10' section of hand crack, and you top out.

If you hike in along the railroad, look for large, towering formations as shown in the photos on river left about a mile back from the river after the 4th rapid in the canyon (Pinball, Zoom Flume, Squeeze Play, then Big Drop). Find the main wash from the gully on river left. It is very obvious . Follow this wash when passable, and pass on high ground when too thick. When you get to the open area with wide views of most of the rock, pick your approach!
