This is another one that's hard to give a ropes grade, because it's so short. It is more like a V5 but with pro. In fact, this route has been bouldered at V5 by Andy O'Brien and climbed one footed in a boot by Adrian when his foot was broken.\n\nPlace a good cam right off the ledge then go straight up the positive crimps and jugs to the top. This is a good, summer, after work climb with afternoon shade. It's probably a 4 star boulder problem (not that I would really know) and a 2-3 star route due to length.","protection":"Two #0.75 Camalots for the start, a quickdraw, and a #2 if you want to sew it up, or four bouldering pads.","location":"This is the left route on the wall.
