This is a large face at the end of staircase. The corner has two cracks opposing each other that can be climbed in a variety of ways. It is fun 5.8. Once you exit the double cracks below the roof, use the hand crack, and traverse the blank face to the right up onto a small ledge. Pull the ledge with a bad ass ring lock! From here, find a belay. There is no hardware. Walk off to the climber's right in a obvious gully after fully topping out.","protection":"A rack to 4\".","location":"This large piece of rock is at the end of the Staircase Area. It is wide open and is marked by MASSIVE boulders sitting on a flat area (River Left). Scramble up to the boulders, and climb a low angled ramp (4th Class) up to a nice platform below the climb. There are many opportunities for more routes. This route is not cleaned up. Bring a helmet, and be ready for loose rock, but also be ready for great features and endless untouched rock. Make a long day of it (or a few days), and camp on the flat area above the river. Climb it if you want, but get a sense of exploration and climb something new!"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,d4b25844-b511-53bc-895e-67a6421d4ec4,5504eb52-2201-5e93-a92b-d908cbfbf0cc","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Buena Vista","Bottom of the Staircase"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.04655,38.67463]},"bbox":[-106.04712596521745,38.67418033981814,-106.04597403478256,38.675079660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115366760","area_id":"VQTrUiIBXpOpK9kIy/vwzA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:05.931Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:55.681Z"}
