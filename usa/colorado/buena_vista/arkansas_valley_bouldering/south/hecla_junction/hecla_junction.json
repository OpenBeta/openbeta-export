The beginning is a tricky bulge up to some solid edges. After that, move right to the arete through the crux where you really feel the exposure. If you stay in the dihedral up the middle, you encounter a mossy ledge which is more 5.8 but needs cleaning. Moving back to the middle above the mossy ledge lends bigger holds.","protection":"As of August 2015, the channel below is 7 feet and clear at 450 cfs. We probed and visually checked. You should do your own inspection as sediment is moved in all the time. A horn in the eddy just above is great to sling with a bowline to move the boat into position to inspect or to set up a belay station, although I've never top roped it, so that eddy may not work for belay. Wear a PFD (life jacket).","location":"Just left of the right arete is a good sharp ledge to start. Move up and right below the overhanging fins onto the slab."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,d4b25844-b511-53bc-895e-67a6421d4ec4,847f4138-9db3-596b-8e4d-e1b0884399f2,68f60656-0eb1-57e6-818a-8f0531f2f71c,2470bdbc-c680-510e-9ddc-4ac8b6d831ff","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Buena Vista","*Arkansas Valley Bouldering","South","Hecla Junction"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0-1"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.05342,38.6389]},"bbox":[-106.05399567798001,38.638450339818135,-106.05284432202001,38.639349660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110838834","area_id":"JHC9vMaAUQ6d3ErIttgx/w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:06.568Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:43.927Z"}
