The first pitch is rated at 5.7 in the Karden guidebook but is probably easier. It involves some slabs that are broken up with easy walking. This pitch is more than 30m!\n\nBe careful; the climbing is easy but a little loose. The second pitch is 5.8 and very enjoyable. The final pitch is the crux and involves committing moves on the left side of the tower to some slab to the final anchors. There was some loose rock when we climbed it, so I would recommend helmets. The bolt hangers are painted brown, so they are very hard to see at times. This climb is well bolted, so just take a second to find your next bolt.\n\nWhen rappelling, knot your ends! If using a 60m rope, it can be managed with about 15 feet of downclimbing.","protection":"Bolts, bring 10 quickdraws.","location":"It is the only route on this wall.
