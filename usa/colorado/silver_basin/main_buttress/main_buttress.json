Immediately after, things ease off a bit, and you find yourself on a big ledge. Head up and traverse a bit to the right, then follow the cracks up to a larger belay ledge.\n\nPitch 2 (5.6). Head straight up from the belay ledge, and choose one of the many crack systems to follow all the way to the top.\n\nYou can descend by walking back to the south, where you'll find an easy walkoff gully.","protection":"We used a single set of cams and a set of nuts.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"fD66CgGJVqieX+umRMCl7w==","name":"Hon Solo","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Dallas Branum and Wes Heredia","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.49401,38.94478]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"112130239","mp_crag_id":"112130136","climb_id":"fD66CgGJVqieX+umRMCl7w==","areaRef":"mkTPKI9bVHKKT0KWpMZyYw=="},"content":{"description":"This is another great route to do if your students are on solo... hence, Hon Solo.\n\nPitch 1 (5.8). There are lots of variations here, but start in the roof area, and work your way up. We were wearing approach shoes and didn't feel particularly bad ass, so we backed off of the first roof and started on a slab to the right. Work your way to the second series of roofs, and pick a path through. The offwidth section has a fun roof pull that goes at around 5.8 (see the photo). Belay at the base of a large slab with a left-leaning crack just over the roof.\n\nPitch 2 (5.6). Head up the left-leaning crack and onto some easier ground. Work your way up the headwall above. From here, you could head straight up a dihedral (probably 5.9+, but we wimped out in our approach shoes) or traverse out right and up a series of good cracks to the top.","protection":"Singles rack of cams and nuts.","location":"This is in the roofs area to the left of\n\nNate's Fate\n\n."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,bf29a20c-bed2-5260-959e-09edc4779149,9a44cf28-8f5b-5472-8a4f-4296a4c67263","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Silver Basin","Main Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.49401,38.94478]},"bbox":[-106.4945881535912,38.944330339818144,-106.49343184640878,38.945229660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112130136","area_id":"mkTPKI9bVHKKT0KWpMZyYw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:20.456Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:20.090Z"}
