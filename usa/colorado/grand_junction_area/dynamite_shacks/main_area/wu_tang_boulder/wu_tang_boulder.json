You have to get the sequence right to finish the wrap around/top out. Once you've made it through the first big moves, try to have you right hand in the last obvious hold before the swing around the corner. Look for a couple great crimps that will help you gain high smearing feet, and make one last desperate move to the top (or balance through sloper crimp things). Use BALANCE or have big arms.","protection":"There are lots of rocks under you.
