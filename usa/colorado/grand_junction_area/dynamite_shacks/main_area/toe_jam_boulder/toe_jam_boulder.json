Then grab that huge hole in the rock with left hand. Stay balanced, and reposition left hand on the right side of the big hole so you can reach as far right with your right hand as possible. The sloping ledge over there is great if you nail the spot. You will feel the barndoor swing coming, so throw a high right foot to maintain balance, work the ledge eventually finding pockets across the top, and move back left a few moves for the awesome lip.
