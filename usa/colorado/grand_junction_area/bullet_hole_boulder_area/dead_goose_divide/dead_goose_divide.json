You will see the line and the possible variations for short or tall people immediately. Make your way to the edge of the roof. At this point, your head is below your feet a bit, so hurry through those heel hooks and toe jams, so you can make two more big moves left and to the top out. The face is DANGEROUS if you swing and pop off you will most likely take the 15 foot fall off the opposing side of that rock just under the topout.\n\nThis thing is amazing, have fun!","protection":"PADS and Luke or another big dude to catch you during that last butt clenching swing :)","location":"It is the biggest, baddest possible/obvious line after you reach the area.
