The grades are moderate, but they're a bit stiff compared to other towers around the Monument and are a serious undertaking considering the long approach, loose rock and lack of quality protection at times. To keep the adventure alive and well on these, I'll be brief on the details, but I wanted to point out a few things that'll help the next party along and recognize Bill Forrest and Steve French, these are stout lines!\n\nThe second Disciple looks like it'll be easy, but bad rock, large pods within the chimney, sand choked cracks, loose blocks, detached flakes, bad pro, hollow panels, flared seems, and a whole lot of pack rack shit make it a hard tick.\n\nThe climb goes up the obvious gash on the west side for 3 pitches. There's a small section of nailing on the second pitch after a traverse right at a fixed pin. On rappel, it looked possible to remain in the crack system you start out on for P2 after the pin and then traverse right with free climbing at a thin ~1 inch sloping edge. If this worked out, you wouldn't need to nail.\n\nLinking P2 & P3 would prevent a hanging belay at old pins that's in the firing path for all the loose rock on the pitch above. If doing this, bring extra fingers and down pro.","protection":"Double set from micro cams to #5 BD, 1 #6, and a few thin Lost Arrows. All the rappels down are from slung features, bring extra rope/cord to replace. Two double rope raps get you back to the ground.","location":"In the back of Devil's Canyon, they're the obvious towers above the cabin."},"__v":0},{"_id":"yNwtw+ZrUbKLr99y980WrA==","name":"Devil's Disciple I","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Bill Forrest and Steve French","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.76786,39.10092]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"110648314","mp_crag_id":"118683537","climb_id":"yNwtw+ZrUbKLr99y980WrA==","areaRef":"5CQ6MofcUfuouJ6sqNpWbQ=="},"content":{"description":"The Disciples are some of the harder summits to reach in the area.

The line will become obvious as you move up from there. It is 3 pitches to the top. The second pitch requires heads up nailing and has potential for a bad ledge fall.\n\nBring a healthy amount of webbing or an old rope to leave as an anchor.  he anchor at the top can be either a juniper or some blocks. We opted for the blocks, the first ascent did the juniper. Do two double rope rappels to get down.","protection":"Two sets from small to fists with one or two bigger pieces. Use mostly peckers on the aid pitch with a few Lost Arrows and baby angles.","location":"It is in the back of Devils's Canyon above the cabin.
