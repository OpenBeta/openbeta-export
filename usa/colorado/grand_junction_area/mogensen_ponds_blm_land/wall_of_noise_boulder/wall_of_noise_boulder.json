Its grade may be a little height-dependent. All the holds are bomber - if you're grabbing choss, you've got the wrong beta.\n\nStart on the obvious rounded hold around head height with a couple of perfect foot edges, and follow the arete, topping out to the left at the tallest part of the overhung face. The crux is probably near the top, but it's hard to tell really - all the holds are good, and the moves are quite fun for the grade.

Figure out those barn-door-prevention feet, then move up and left, topping out on either the decent lip directly above the start or the excellent jug behind the corner of the boulder.
