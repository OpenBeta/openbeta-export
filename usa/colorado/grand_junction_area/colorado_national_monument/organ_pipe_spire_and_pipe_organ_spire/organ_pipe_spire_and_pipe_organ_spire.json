Only instead of different endings, all choices in this novel lead to the heinous roof at the summit cap rock.  We both found the experience we had, to marginal at best and probably suited only for those true desert rats that chase down old Kor and Carter routes.\n\nAlthough; future parties might have an altogether completely different experience due to our efforts.  We both felt this route should be called the Constant Gardener for the excessive amount of exfoliated crap we trundled off of it.  No one had been there in years.\n\nThere is no information for this route in any of Bjornstad books, but it has all the feel of an old Carter with its well-driven Star-drives and homemade hangars.  Someone has been up there in the last ten years or so and given new life to the anchors.  The important ones all sport at least one 1/2\" bolt.\n\nIt should be noted that this climb sits in the perfect spot for summer ascents if you are quick you will be in the shade all day.\n\nP1:\n\nChoose your adventure, right or left side.  Looking up; your two choices are an ugly looking chimney or an intriguing looking hand crack that roofs out.  We choose WRONG and ended up battling the choss monsters.  Its probably only 5.10 or so but given the ++ for a severe garbage factor.  The right side is much cleaner now; although still ugly.  When we rapped down the left side, we found the chimney to look much better up close. It worms its way up moderately good stone and looks to be about 5.9.\n\nP2:\n\nAnother choice, your two options here are to high step the belay and run up a string of bat hooks in marginal stone, or to down climb off the belay and free your way over to the start of the seam that takes you to the big ledge.  I found the level of acceptable risk too great for option 1.  (What?  Bat hooks out here?  To say the least  Bizarre) If one of them blows you are going to need a hospital no two ways about it.  We chose RIGHT.  I gingerly freed over to a chossy seam and proceeded to garden my way up this right angling crack finding a few C2 moves  maybe;  some C1, lots of trundling, a few free moves, and an exciting fear factor style 5.8 top out.  After gardening the calcite and sand out of the seam, a few pin scars revealed themselves.  Some low balls might be helpful.  It should be of note, that if you blow it down low on option two you could get hurt as well.  This pitch gets you to a big ledge and some artifacts from days gone by.\n\nP3:\n\nChossy free to a ledge, and then the work begins.  Thrutch up some wide till it pinches out, finagle some crap till you can push that green #6 up in the the wide slot.   Work up more widness till it pinches down again.  Pull through into the good rest via some more thinish moves.  Work up the roof via old bolts till your are below the Maw.  Figure it out and make your moves to the good two bolt belay at the summit, via bust ass free climbing, bat hooking, or painfull aiding.\n\nThis route will go free at a moderate grade to someone with a sick sense of humor.","protection":"Singles from purple TCUs to a #6 Friend.

It sits next to Pipe Organ Spire, and is the shorter of the two, furthest from the rim.  The names are quite confusing!  A photo of the south faces of the spires is on p.269 of Bjornstad's Desert Rock III.  The best approach is to park at the Book Cliff Overlook and rappel in as you would for Sentinel Spire: Walk south to the rim (about 90 seconds from the car) and on the left (east) there is a small pine tree to rap from.  Rap about 100' and leave your rope fixed.  Don't forget to bring jumars for the way out.    Descend slabs and follow a faint trail that winds down and eventually to the right beneath the south face of Sentinel Spire where the classic route Medicine Man is located.  Hike south toward Organ Pipe Spire for about 20 minutes wrapping around the base of it to arrive beneath the south face.  It is very important to walk in the drainages following a circuitous path rather than trample the fragile soil taking a direct path toward the objective.  The direct path will only save a few minutes but could harm the soil for years!  It is also possible to park at the Pipe Organ Overlook, hike 5 minutes to the rim and rap from there, but I found it more difficult to deal with the much longer rappel (and jumar), as well as a pesky cliff band that is time-consuming to negotiate.  Pipe Dream begins in the middle of the south face at a small, left-facing dihedral about 25' left of a long, clean dihedral.\n\nPitch 1: Climb 15' up the dihedral, then hand traverse left on flat, sandy holds into a right-facing dihedral.  Layback and jam up to a roof, turn it on the right, and jam wide hands about 10' above the roof to establish a belay on gear (#.5, #1, #3.5 for belay).  5.11, 80'.  Bring all cams #3 and smaller with just one #2.  The first 30' of the pitch are very sandy, but the quality of the route improves above that point.\n\nPitch 2: Fire up the wide hands splitter, layback up and left around an exposed arete, and tiptoe up large flakes to a small stance with two belay bolts.  5.10+, 50'.  Gear: (2)#.5, (1)#.75, (1)#1, (2)#2, (3)#3, (2)#3.5, (1)#4.\n\nPitch 3: The crux.  Climb straight above the belay, then launch into the clean, overhanging, and strenuous offwidth that finishes above the lip of small roof at a 3-bolt hanging belay. After some fist jams at the start, the offwidth dictates strenuous laybacking rather than full-on groveling because of its position in a corner.  5.11+, 60'.  Gear: (1)#.5 plus everything #3 and larger.\n\nPitch 4:  Squirm up a short offwidth above the belay, then follow the sandy crack that veers right after about 15'.  Pass a fixed anchor and where the crack ends, face traverse left for 8' on flat edges until below a second anchor.  Mantel up to this anchor and belay.  It is also possible to continue 20' to the false summit and belay from #3.5 and #4 cams.  5.10-, 80' or 100'.  Gear: 2 each all sizes.\n\nPitch 5: Once on the false summit, climb a very short overhanging wall on the left side of the summit block via fun yet nervewracking jugs.  These moves can protect with a #4.5 cam in a hole and/or a thread.  Walk to the summit.  5.6, 30'.\n\nDescent: Downclimb to the anchor atop pitch 4 placing gear for the second.  Rap 80' to the 3-bolt anchor atop pitch 3.  Rap 190' to the ground - free hanging the entire way!\n\nNote: For great crack climbing of all sizes without much choss, climb the first 3 pitches then rap.  The last 100' includes some bad rock just like any tower in the Monument, but the summit is worth the effort if you're so inclined.  Pipe Dream is possibly the second route to the summit of Organ Pipe Spire, and it may be the only free route.","protection":"Recommended rack in Camalot sizes:(2)#.4, (5)#.5, (4)#.75, (2)#1, (2)#2, (3)#3,(2)#3.5, (4)#4, (1)#4.5Each anchor consists of bomber bolts or drilled angles except the top of pitch one, which takes good gear.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"/XfKCGsjVDmfEQpVapHbTg==","name":"Organ Pipe Spire - The Weird Fun","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"James Stover, Paul Stoner","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.72614,39.09875]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106899487","mp_crag_id":"113626593","climb_id":"/XfKCGsjVDmfEQpVapHbTg==","areaRef":"LonuF9wcWi6bIncZe2REfw=="},"content":{"description":"This was a new addition to Organ Pipe Spire, done in the fall of 2009.
