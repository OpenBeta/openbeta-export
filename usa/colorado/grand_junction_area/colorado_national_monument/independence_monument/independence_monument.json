Route-finding is straight-forward and the line is fairly direct right to the summit.\n\nStart on the SE side of the monument at a detached pillar.  It's a wide 5.10 on the right or 5.8 on the left.  Climb to top of the pillar for a single bolt belay.  P2: Supposedly the first part of this section goes free, but the pro is difficult to place, and there's not really a good rest stance.  I aided the whole second pitch which is 100' past the overhanging white wall with black horizontal streaks.  Small stoppers and RPs along with a few cams will sew it up.  Finish on a ledge with a bolt, not on the sloping ledge with only one drilled angle.  P3: 60' Take the 5.8 chimney right out of the belay and make some tough moves to get going.  Wide pro is useful here.  Then lieback the exposed crack to another ledge with two drilled angles again.  P4: 90' A fantastic pitch.  Start in the hand crack up to a wide crack, but avoid using your #3 friend (or equivalent) size pieces down low here as you'll need them for the crux hand crack.  Once you're established below a block at the top of the wide crack, make committing moves up the overhanging hand crack with only a few footholds to help.  Keep plugging those #3 friends up the parallel crack for about 30' til you're under a roof.  Traverse left under the roof (no pro) and exit to a ledge with two drilled angles.  P5: 80' Now make your second carry all those large cams for this pitch.  You'll only need a very small micro cam, RPs, and one each cams in the #1-3 Friend size.  A #4.5 Camalot can be used to protect the last wide slot before the belay ledge.  This pitch is 5.9+ but has some tricky and scary pro.  Lieback the thin crack and head right but be careful of the huge block after the first rest stance.  I put some weight on a micro cam here and started shifting the whole block.  A fixed pin is in the dihedral on the left, but this is off route.  Make some very wide stemming moves to get past this hard passage and up to a hand crack.  Pull over the lip and onto a spacious ledge with three drilled pins.  P6: 100' The final and dramatic pitch to end a superb route.  Aid up 13 drilled angles right to the summit with some runout easy face climbing in between the 2nd and 3rd bolts and the 4th and 5th bolts.\n\nTo descend, make a double rope rap of Otto's Route past Lunchbox Ledge to the large shelf with the Time Tunnel.  Traverse down the small tunnel to a short rap to a large ledge.

I have personally seen a French dude take a \"HUGE\" whipper from high on the mud band pitch.  He escaped unscathed and it appeared, went on to finish the route.  I whipped on pitch three trying to free the slabby pockets that link the corners.  Things up here are generally pretty poor as far as the stone goes.  Another observation is that the piton scars get a lot smaller as you get higher (lots of suitors for the first few pitches but not so many near to the top).\n\nWe nailed only near the ground on pitch one (one toucan as I recall) and throughout the crux on pitch four which involved a fair amount of nailing including a few pieces of ice gear, pounded directly into the mud filled cracks.

This route goes up the left side of Independence Monument's south side following a ramp to a distinct chimney/crack system.  The south facing exposure makes the route a good choice for cool spring or fall days.  Start the climb by going to the left side of the monument's south side.\n\nP1. The climb starts by getting onto the right leaning ramp leading to the chimney system.  Accomplish this by aiding up a thin crack on the face under the ramp.  The crack has a fixed pin on the face to the side of it about 35' up.  This is 20' to the right of a big roof with an offwidth up it.  Aid up the crack using small pro until you can free climb.  I started freeing at the start of the dihedral with fixed pin.  Climb up past a lone fixed pin to a two drilled-angle belay above the crack.  You can use these as a belay or directional, then climb up the ramp  5.5-6 to another drilled angle belay.\n\nP2. From 2nd drilled angle belay, squeeze up an offwidth (5.8) and follow wide crack to two angle belay below chimney.\n\nP3. THE chimney pitch - Fun, full-body chimneying is the highlight of this pitch. From the belay on the ramp, get into the tight chimney and clip the drilled pin on the face.  Squeeze up the narrow chimney until it widens a little above.  Continue a little higher where a 1\" crack starts near the outside edge of the chimney.  Use this for pro/jams and continue up.  After small crack ends, go up and right following the main chimney to a two- pin belay inside chimney.\n\nP4. This pitch continues up the chimney deep into the fissure.

If anyone knows the complete first ascent information, let me know and I will edit the route information.  Thanks!\n\nThis route climbs a long crack system 80 feet right of\n\nOtto's Route\n\non the northwest side of the monument.  While there probably are not any moves individually harder than 5.9+, it is more vertical, sustained and difficult than\n\nOttos Route\n\n.  This route was harder than what I normally lead (I took a few falls), but serious climbers that enjoy sustained, vertical, trad routes may find it more enjoyable than\n\nOtto's\n\n.\n\nPitch 1:  Climb a right-facing crack to a small belay ledge with two pitons and slings (visible in the photo).  In places this crack is fairly wide  I used a #4 cam to protect a few moves.  (80 feet, 5.8)\n\nPitch 2:  Follow the crack past two pitons on the right side about 40 feet up, where the crack/dihedral is too thin to protect.  Continue up to a sloping belay ledge with one piton and some slings with a couple of stoppers attached.  (60 feet, 5.9)\n\nPitch 3:  Climb straight up the crack which varies in width and is a little sandy.  The crux for me was about 30 feet up where the crack bulges out to the right.  I passed it with a layback, but it's very exposed and challenging to place good gear in the crack.  Be careful placing cams here -- I had two blow out on me when I fell.  (However, I got a #4 Camalot in just below the crux, and it held me on a couple of falls.)  I climbed this pitch to a ledge below the OW/chimney.  Not a very comfortable belay ledge, but I was nearly out of gear for setting an anchor.  I used a #5 cam for an anchor belay sitting below the offwidth.  (60 feet, 5.9+)\n\nPitch 4:  Climb straight up an awkward offwidth/chimney.  It starts nearly vertical, then gradually the slope eases back.  Not many options for gear, unless you bring something like a #5 Camalot.  But once you're up about 15 feet, the slope is such that a long fall is unlikely since you're inside the squeeze chimney.  The chimney tops out just below the huge ledge on the right side of\n\nOtto's\n\ntime tunnel. (5.8, 50 feet)\n\nPitches 5 & 6:  Scramble to the time tunnel ledge and follow the last two pitches of\n\nOtto's Route\n\nto the summit.\n\nNote: strong climbers with a 60m rope could probably combine pitches 1 & 2, and pitches 3 & 4.  I kept the pitches short to preserve gear for protection and belay anchors.","protection":"Double rack recommended.  I used cams of every size on this climb, from smaller than a 0.3 to a couple of large Camalots (#4 and #5).   Two fixed pitons at first belay ledge.  Two pitons right of the crack about 40 feet above the first belay.  A single piton (with a sling and some stoppers) at the second sloping belay ledge.  Nothing else above that until you join\n\nOtto's Route\n\n.\n\nWhile there are many, many  options for placing gear in the crack, I rated the route PG-13 simply because in places the crack is a little flaring and the sandstone is soft.  I had two cams at the crux bust out on a fall -- but the #4 held!  Just be careful setting your protection and back it up.","location":"To get to the route, go to the start of\n\nOtto's Route\n\n, then walk climber's right (south/west) about 80 feet.  The crack system is pretty obvious.  When we climbed it, there was a visible set of slings attached to two pitons about 80' up, then another set of slings 50' above that on the right side of the crack (harder to see from the ground).  See the attached photo.\n\nDescent:  You could rappel down from the first set of slings on the two pitons.  From the second set of slings, one could rappel from the slings, but the single piton anchor and stoppers looked a little dicier -- definitely want to make sure those stoppers are set well.
