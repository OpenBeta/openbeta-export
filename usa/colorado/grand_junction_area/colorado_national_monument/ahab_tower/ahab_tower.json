It is not super awesome in aesthetics or rock quality, but it definitely has some good sections and makes a quickie for those looking to bolster their numbers.\n\nP1. Find the overhanging chimney crack on the northwest face. Climb the crux at 5.9+, then head up through the tower to the south side and a gear belay in the sun, 5.9+, 70' +/-.\n\nP2. Wander up right past easy broken plates to a short hands section where you are forced to make some moves right on steeper ground. Head up to a subsummit, and sling the top of this for an anchor, 5.9, 70'+/-.\n\nP3. Climb a bold 5.7 face to some gear and then more bold, easy climbing to the summit and a two bolt belay, 5.7, 30' +/-.","protection":"Two Ropes, alpine draws, nuts, singles from .3-#5 C4, Doubles from .3-#3","location":"Walk out to the Window Rock overlook for a good view.  The start is on the opposite side of the tower from this viewpoint but you can see the upper two pitches.  walk 150 yard left and fix a rope to decend the 5th class broken terrain. Walk and bushwalk to the base.\n\nRap one long 150' rappel to the base."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,ad22b47b-28bf-545c-bb26-55da9f0f1805,48dfe34b-9a47-5884-b52e-9c2dd124fe02","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Colorado National Monument","Ahab Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.7346,39.1016]},"bbox":[-108.73517943749609,39.10115033981815,-108.73402056250391,39.10204966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113626536","area_id":"SN/jS5pHWIS1Lpwt0ST+Ag=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:44.304Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:49.280Z"}
