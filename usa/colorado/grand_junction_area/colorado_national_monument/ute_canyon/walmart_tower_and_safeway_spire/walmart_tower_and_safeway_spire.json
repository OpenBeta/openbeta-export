Walk out on a slabby ledge on the east side of the tower until you reach an obvious crack.  There is a move with fall potential to reach the crack.\n\nOnce in the crack, climb past loose rock to a block that does not seem like it should be solid.  Using the block, aid up past a bad seam to a good crack.  Continue to a large ledge.\n\nAt this ledge, you can put in a belay or continue to the summit via a bolt ladder.\n\nThe bolt ladder consists of 5 empty angle holes, 1 loose bolt, and 2 good bolts (one in the middle and one at the top).  The first empty angle hole should be easily skipped if you are not short.\n\nDescent-Rappel down the northeast face. One full 60m will be just enough if you stop on the slabby ledge that you start on. If you rappel to the ground, it will add on 50' and you will obviously need another rope.\n\nThere is an opportunity for a direct start to this line.
