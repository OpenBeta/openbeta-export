This being said, it is one of the most incredible summits The Monument has to offer.\n\nP1. We went up a cruddy chimney which exits a small roof (C2) and eases over to some 5.9 R (bad pro). The first half is possible to avoid but would require some unprotected traversing. Belay near a ledge with big cams.\n\nP2. Walk left on a good ledge to connect with a beak seam which gains the upper crack system. Mixed aid/free with lots of hollow sounding (scary) flakes with good cracks (hands -#6) in the back. Pull through a kitty litter section, and continue up to a small roof. Some tricks and some smaller cams will get you to the summit.","protection":"A standard desert rack and 2 x 70m ropes (one rappel).","location":"Start in the obvious chimney on the northeast side of the tower.

Go up an awesome chimney/OW. It's pretty wild up there and super adventury. This is an excellent pitch.\n\nYou are on a beautiful terrace with the hopes of an easy scramble out.
