This \"Crack of Noon Tower\" is for those who get scooped on the Kissing Couple because they got the \"gentlemen of leisure\" start!\n\nThe climber's left is supposedly easier than the chimney on the right.  I won't spoil the adventure for you. The \"Crack of Noon Route\" on the climber's left is of a fair quality for the Monument with a few good sections.  I have not climbed the \"Right Route,\" but Mack and his (brother?) reported it to be fairly sustained and scary.  On the FA, James and Mack were forced to simul-rappel off the top putting the finishing brush strokes on a true quality desert adventure that left the least amount of impact as possible.  It has been rumored that there were anchors placed by an unknown party at a later date.\n\nThe line in green on the beta photo looks to be an excellent fistjam adventure long and sustained.  It is probably undone, unless Matt L. or one of the countless other hardmen around here scooped her up.","protection":"Save a few fist or big hands pieces for the top of \"Crack of Noon Route.\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"L6ZoCMCQUk6uYwd5ytPcVQ==","name":"Airport Tower","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Harvey Carter & Crew","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.71855,39.08907]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105847248","mp_crag_id":"108059206","climb_id":"L6ZoCMCQUk6uYwd5ytPcVQ==","areaRef":"O0djTBUyWvyEUBFKfhNjKw=="},"content":{"description":"Another one fit for the dumpster, but some of us like that sort of thing so ---- . I don't even know know if this is its real name. We just started calling it \"Airport Tower\" 'cause the top is so long and flat. There is not much to report, two terrifing pitches of the worst the Monument has to offer, (which at times can make Fisher Towers look like Yosemite). It has several \"fraid\" sections as you are too gripped to really pull on anything, including the rock. Most of your gear is placed in vertical sand, and as I recall, it leans toward the smaller stuff, which out here is not to be trusted! You'll never be so gripped hanging on 5.9 again.\n\nI don't know who did the first ascent, I have heard through grapevines that a few shadowy folks have been seen on the top of it; but the only real reason you would even try to get to the top of this thing, (aside from pure novelty); is it used to be the host to a truly awesome slackline; a 70 footer of pure highline magic! Stupendous highlining in an amazing place! That is until some deush chopped the bolts on the tower side!!!Â  So, I don't know how you get down now. Other than those chopped bolts there was no other evidence of descent anchors. Those guys probably invoked some sort of climbing vodoo to get down! They definitely brought onto themselves some bad climbing karma! Anyway, this one is only if you dare!","protection":"Doubles to a #4 Friend, and a standard Scottish rack.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,ad22b47b-28bf-545c-bb26-55da9f0f1805,a5a2ca0a-2c4e-5bd6-a0a9-fac15d58ca13,3b47634c-1532-5afc-8450-114a7e13632b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Colorado National Monument","Kissing Couple area","Crack of Noon Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.71855,39.08907]},"bbox":[-108.71912933454222,39.088620339818135,-108.71797066545774,39.089519660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108059206","area_id":"O0djTBUyWvyEUBFKfhNjKw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-108.71912933454222,39.088620339818135],[-108.71797066545774,39.088620339818135],[-108.71797066545774,39.089519660181864],[-108.71912933454222,39.089519660181864],[-108.71912933454222,39.088620339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:44.318Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:53.030Z"}
