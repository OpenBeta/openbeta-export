Hand place pins in the holes and aid up the face to a mantle onto the summit. (5.7, C1+, 40').\n\nWhen we climbed this, we topped out on the summit to find no anchor.  The rope that was slung around the summit by the last party to rappel must have blown away.  We decided that two pins would be less of an eye sore than a rope around the summit, so I replaced the pins that we once there.\n\nDescent - rappel from the summit to the notch on top of pitch 2.
