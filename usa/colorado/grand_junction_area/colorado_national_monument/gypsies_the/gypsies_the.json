Both pitches were physical in nature, but in general, it was characterized by fairly strenous hand jamming and good finger torques.  It is possible that some or all of this was done by another party a while ago as we did encounter (what looked like) a bail bolt and single biner at mid-height on the 1st pitch right next to bomer gear.  The rock was not definitely Indian Creek quality but passable for solid, Monument, tower climbing.  Tape is recomended as the jamming on the first pitch will turn your hands into a bloody mess.\n\nP1: make a difficult move up through the Chinle to a good stance and the real start. Climb the strenous butt flare (5.10+) with decent jams up and into the rest of the climb which varies in and out the sizes from rattley fingers to tight fists.  Climb all the way to the big ledge where a good anchor can be made on finger-sized gear.  5.10+, +/- 130'.\n\nP2: climb the figer crack directly above the belay via fun yet though provoking 5.9 climbing.

Go up an easy 5th class section to a small ledge below an offwidth/chimney.\n\nP1:  Climb the stout beginning and grunt your way into the chimney.  It won't take long before the rock turns more into clumped together sand in the form of huge boulders stacked on top of each other.  Carefully run it out over this section, taking the right option.  When I was climbing this, I kept thinking about the game Jenga, pull out the wrong piece and it all comes down!  (It's probably not that bad, but it was scary).  Once past the rotten rock, you'll be at the saddle between the towers.  There's a nice crack to build an anchor (#0.75 Camalots).\n\nP2: Climb the obvious crack up the middle tower.  The rock is nicely varnished and solid.  The crack itself is one of those cracks within a crack systems, which just means fun interesting climbing in my opinion.  I ended the pitch below a short OW that leads to a nice ledge (but nothing to set an anchor with).  You'll need big cams to set the anchor.  (#4.5 and #5 Camalots, if I remember correctly).  You could run this pitch to the top, but you might have rope drag which would add to the terror of the top out move.\n\nP2.5: Climb up the short offwidth, look for a small hole to hand place a baby angle.  If you are like me, you'll wish the hole was a little deeper and the piton didn't wiggle around so much.  Test it, top step,  and then make one of those graceful, beached whale, mantel moves while desperately clinging for a hold that's not there.  If the angle pops, or you blow the mantel, you most likely won't be walking back down to the car, it's a pretty scary move.  The anchor is far to the left, best to give the rope a nice flick to pop out the angle allowing the second to safely jug up to the anchor without the danger of a huge swing.\n\nIt's a beautiful summit, rarely visited summit up there.","protection":"Bring several big cams, a #4 Bigbro was nice to have, but you'd be safe enough with out it, a baby angle, and a standard desert rack.","location":"These towers are a pain to get to.

But this approach requires crossing private property and there are several \"No Monument Access\" signs on the roads there.  Another option is to head up to Red Canyon (which also requires crossing private property unless you start in a drainage from S.

This quickly leads to a squeeze then to some giant chockstones that seem like they are just waiting for you to give them a nudge so they can come crashing down.  Luckily it's possible to chimney/stem past the scariest one.  Tunnel through to the left of the biggest boulder/chockstone and set a belay at the saddle.\n\nP2:  Supposedly this pitch is only 5.5, which makes me feel pretty bad, because I was challenged and terrified on the opening moves!  Start by making a very committing move from the saddle to establish yourself on the tower.  There is absolutely no gear for the crux move of the pitch.  If you blow it...ouch, you'll most likely have some hospital bills to pay.  Once you've made the most committing moves, it's easy ground to a bolt to some more run out climbing to a ledge.  At the ledge, there is an optional belay off of two hangerless bolts (that, of course, are nice and loose), better to keep going.  Aid off the bolts and hand place 4 baby angles in the drilled holes to a ledge with bolted anchors.\n\nP2.5: I was rope solo on this and didn't have to worry about rope drag, but it might be a problem if you continue to the top without stopping at the anchor atop of the aid section.  Either way, the last bit requires about 30' of free climbing up a crack that disappointingly doesn't go all the way to the top, luckily the climbing isn't too difficult to the top.\n\nOne double rope rap will get you down.","protection":"Several wide hands/fist-sized cams, a #4 Bigbro was nice to have for the squeeze, mainly because it's in good rock and will be the only reliable pro you'll get for stemming around the first big chockstone, 4 baby angles, a rivet hanger, and some finger sized cams.  2 60m ropes.","location":"These towers are a pain to get to.
