There's a nice pod with a ledge to set up a belay (#0.75 Camalots work well).  The crack ranges from fingers to fists.  It could be free climbed at 5.11ish (I'm only guessing, I happily just aided up the thing), the only problem is there's a lot of dirt in the cracks and most of the features on the face (and some in the cracks) are pealing off.  C1+, 100'.\n\nP2: continue up the crack via an OW that quickly goes to fingers through some junk rock.  Free climb up the chimney with no pro for a bit to some more OW on some very, very soft rock.  This will lead you to the top of a pillar leaning against the main tower and also to the top of P2 of\n\nThe Cleansing\n\n.

Be careful with the second rap down, the climb is overhanging and you'll be in the air and to the right of the next anchor, so you'll have to do a combo of swinging and running across the wall to get to the anchor, pretty exciting!\n\nIt's a beautiful summit up there, and right next to it is the untouched summit of the lower Irishman's Temple.  And by right next to it, I mean you'll get the idea that you could just hop on over there.  Flat landing, a little lower, I'm pretty damn sure it can be done and that it would be very similar to the jump on the Mace in Sedona.","protection":"Double set of cams from fingers to fists with a few extra mid range sizes.

Enter the main weakness accessing the upper reaches of the tower. Thin, clean aiding in a small corner gets you almost there.
