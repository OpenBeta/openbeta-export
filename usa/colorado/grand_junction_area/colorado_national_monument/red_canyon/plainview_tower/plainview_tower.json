Bluecollar climbing goes progressively upward through the sizes. Fight your way up the left-facing corner. This is a good, fun pitch on good stone, 5.10; 110' +/-.\n\nP2. Stem through the gap till it is possible to face climb up the slab on excellent stone with excellent protection. Once on the big ledge, an uber junky 8' awaits to finalize this adventure, this is a really fun pitch despite the summit cap. 5.11 C0; 50' +/-.\n\nCaviat: The summit of this tower is a festering pile, and the rap is the bad part. The anchor is good, however descend at your own peril, wear a helmit, and use your brain when returning back down to the notch, there's enough loose block up there to ruin your day.","protection":"Doubles from a #1 Metolius to a #5 Camalot.  If climbing\n\nMidsummer's\n\nout to the rim, you will also need doubles from 00 & triples from a 1 Metolius to red Camalot.  You will need three ropes, one to make a rappel anchor at the rim, one to descend and jug, and one to climb on.  It might be possible to make it to the notch with a single 70, but we didn't try it, and it would be pretty close.","location":"Ronin climbs the skier's right of this tower. You will need a spare rope to create an anchor off the trees to descend down into to the notch - (from the lip, it is a 130'+/- rappel). From there, it's a long (single 70m) rappel off good anchors to a ledge at the base of the dihedral.  Bring some gear to anchor yourself, pull your rope, and have fun.  DO NOT descend all the way to the ground or you will seriously reduce the quality of this adventure.  This is a great climb for avoiding the sun and is in the shade till 2:00 pm in early/mid-August."},"__v":0},{"_id":"aSTzBJesWgqZm4i3zSsFSw==","name":"Midsummer's Night Dream","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"James Stover, Ryan Dutch","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.64534,39.05253]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"107744467","mp_crag_id":"107743751","climb_id":"aSTzBJesWgqZm4i3zSsFSw==","areaRef":"MA4H+kRUUs691jRyqqsDkg=="},"content":{"description":"1 pitch:  Tight fingers and tips on a dead vertical wall carry you off the ledge to a small roof where it is possible to start plugging the 0.5s in, go for another 40' to a stance and where the climb kicks back a little and eases up to hands and tight hands to the rim.
