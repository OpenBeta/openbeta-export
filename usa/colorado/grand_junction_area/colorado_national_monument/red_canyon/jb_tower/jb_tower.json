This pitch will eat medium-sized hexes in a few places, so bring them. (5.11) 80' +/-.\n\nP2: While you belayer ducks under the overhang, thrutch up the grungy corner to a good stance and the start of the wide splitter in Indian Creek quality rock. Go up the splitter (5.10) into the deep chimney and onto the crux where the chimney pitches down again. Fight the exposure as you work your way up this notch and into the next large pod. (5.11 TR) 80' +/-.\n\nP3: Just off the belay, go around the arete into a thin, gently overhanging splitter that rapidly goes to wide. Go up to a ledge through another wide overhang and up the final 5.9 thrutch to a twin tipped summit. (C1 5.9) 70' +/-.\n\nThis was named after a long time local who has since moved on. Man, JB, you got a great imagination!\n\nWe really had fun on this one. Maybe it was our state of mind, who knows? It was freezing cold, snowing horizontally at times, sunny at others. This is a rare tower summit and a super imposing line up a shield of dark, red sandstone. Have at her, and maybe you too will have what it takes to be a \"Snake Charmer\"\n\nDescent: three rappels with a seventy meter rope.\n\nIt should be of note, that on the way out, if you skirt the cliff band directly from the tower, you will be rewarded with an awesome Otto route up through the first overhangs. We roped up and short hauled the bags, you probably should, too! It's bold and 100 years old! Follow the line of least resistance up through to the rim and you find more of them. If you planned ahead, your rope will be there for you and you can \"mountaineer\" up through this last section with your pack on!","protection":"Singles from #0.1 to #6 Camalot / triples in the #0.5 - #6 Camalot / hexes / long runners / 70 meter rope.","location":"This route goes up the dark red colored South Face of JB Tower.
