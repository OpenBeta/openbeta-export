There's a fun sequence in the middle that adds some variety. Next, climb more hands and then you get to a nice rest below the crux. Pull the overhang with fists and a jug or two.","protection":"Rack from fingers to fists, but be heavier on the hand-size section. You could get by with 1 #4, I was happy to have 2. A single 70m gets you down, but I don't think it's long enough to run a TR or be lowered off with, it is better to rappel.","location":"It is on the down canyon side of Four Leaf Clover Tower."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,ad22b47b-28bf-545c-bb26-55da9f0f1805,6ba8f514-ee5d-5147-9c9a-6e67036e784f,38c20642-46d0-5120-88df-69f536906543","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Colorado National Monument","Red Canyon","Four Leaf Clover Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.64534,39.05253]},"bbox":[-108.6459190346749,39.05208033981813,-108.64476096532512,39.05297966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110003715","area_id":"OMIGQkbQUSCI32n1NpBlQw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-108.6459190346749,39.05208033981813],[-108.64476096532512,39.05208033981813],[-108.64476096532512,39.05297966018186],[-108.6459190346749,39.05297966018186],[-108.6459190346749,39.05208033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:44.304Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:23.557Z"}
