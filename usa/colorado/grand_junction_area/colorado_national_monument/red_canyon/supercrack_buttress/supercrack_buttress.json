There is a plaque at the base. I seem to remember the upper third of the route being the crux protected by some green Aliens. The climb follows a small crack recessed in a shallow squeeze. I remember doing some squeezing next to a large block that seemed to be fairly secure, but you never know.... You end up jamming with one hand and doing the Wiggle Worm with your body.
