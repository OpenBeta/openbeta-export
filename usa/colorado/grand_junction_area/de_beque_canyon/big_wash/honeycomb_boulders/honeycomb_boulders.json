Start with hands matched on the bottom left corner of the creek face of Honeycomb Boulder. Traverse almost all the way around the boulder and top out. The crux is near the beginning. Once you have rounded the corner to the backside, the movement eases to 4th class for a moment before the final challenging section. Finish all the way on the arete to the right.\n\nThe honeycomb texture one this rock is crazy to look at but makes for sharp climbing holds. The rock is also very brittle, so use a good spotter. Weird knobs provide plenty of platforms for your feet. This crazy route is fun for the grade, and the odd rock makes it worthwhile. It probably deserves 2.5 stars for being lengthy, unique, and interesting, but it is brittle, sharp, and out of the way.","protection":"Pad and competent spotter.
