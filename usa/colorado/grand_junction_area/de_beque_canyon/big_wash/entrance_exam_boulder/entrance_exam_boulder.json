Move to the sloper with the right hand, then, with a left heel hook, move out to the 2-3 finger pocket as you come out the prow.\n\nFrom there, move the right hand to the positive hold on the side, and prepare for the swing. Once you've stuck the swing, head up using huecos and rails. It's harder than it looks.\n\nAfter the swing, there is a campus option if you're like me and lack proper footwork.","protection":"Pads and a spotter but the landing is pretty good.","location":"Again, this is located on the west prow.
