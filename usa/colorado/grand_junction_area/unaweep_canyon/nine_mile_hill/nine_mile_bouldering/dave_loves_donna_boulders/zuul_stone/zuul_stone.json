With some more traffic (I know, I'm being optimistic), I can imagine the rock and landing becoming more desirable.\n\nSit start deep in the confines below the convergence of the two boulders with hands matched on an irregular jug. From there, place a left heel hook, drop the right shoulder, make the big reach to a sloper (no dabbing the adjacent boulder), match a right hand next to it on a pinch-sloper, slide the heel down the chute into place, stick a big right hand to a good edge, cross over with the left hand to the generous rail, continue traversing right along the rail until a position can be gained that allows for a move to the lip, match on it, and negotiate the mantel to send it.","protection":"The landing isn't good on this one, but it pads really nicely.
