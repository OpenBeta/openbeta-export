The crux is testing your ability to pull on split bi-doigt pockets and crimps with off-center feet. The pockets are atypical of Unaweep and make this line a particular gem to those wishing to punch through. Syphilis is on impeccable/unique stone, that is free of STDs. The landing is easily protectable with pads and a spotter.","protection":"Two or three pads and spotter.","location":"This line is on the northeast overhanging face of The Interim Boulder. It starts on a nice three-finger slot and a right hand pinch-pull and opposing, non-positive feet. The climb then moves up left to the mono/bidoigt out left, then right to a crimp and an intermediate to a toothed mono-and-a-half before deadpointing to a mini-arete crimp and then firing to the apex jug.
