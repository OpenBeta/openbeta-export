From there, pop a left out to a bump on the arete, stab out to a right sidepull crimp, slap a left up the blank arete (crux?), move the right to a sloping bump (crux?), gain the left hand pinch, move the right to some bumps and sidepull.  At that point, the rock's relief makes for a welcome rest before finishing up the slab through the tree branches.\n\nThe key to this lies in maintaining tension on the right toe hook.","protection":"A pair of pads will do, the landing is good but is gently sloping.","location":"This ascends the west face of Lenny Rock."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,94d4760b-f861-551a-8e9c-b1e4f32fd187,6f7c035e-28a6-5312-83ba-98be3de0457c,193d0660-7e67-53f4-8963-e5d1ff4baeb4","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Blue Moon Boulder Area","Local Group Area","Lenny Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.50316,38.89347]},"bbox":[-108.50373773568285,38.893020339818136,-108.50258226431716,38.893919660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108521061","area_id":"GT0GYH5nU/SJY+XR/0uutA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:31.553Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:33.454Z"}
