I was dumbfounded this hasn't been cleaned and published by now, maybe it's the sketchy landing ;) Regardless, this is either a great warm-up for the Punchdance problems, or a worthy objective on its own. Just don't fuck up the last move....\n\nBegin sitting at the center of the East face with your left hand on a big sloping edge and your right hand low on a crimpy, sidepull flake. Move up and slightly right. Some moves are a little reachy, hence the slash grade.\n\nThe crux is high and committing, and the landing less than ideal. I sorely wished I had a second pad and/or a spotter, but hey, it's the Quarantine Boulder, you're on your own down here!","protection":"Social distance, hand washing, and courage.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,6962b466-079a-55be-aa1b-689ae1b704b9,e13db8e8-537c-5c22-bdce-ef9cc387fb4b,3c8c97ad-cc71-50b9-a7d6-2c4217333791","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Triangle Boulder Area","West Triangle","Quarantine Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2-3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.49748,38.9257]},"bbox":[-108.49805799806417,38.925250339818135,-108.49690200193582,38.92614966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118724253","area_id":"PIyXrcxxULmn1ixCFzM3kQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:25.862Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:27.395Z"}
