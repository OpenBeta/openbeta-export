Some cool intro climbing on weird slopers and fins leads to a large move to a really sick pinch. After this, you have to match on some incut crimps using a bicycle, then traverse straight right to some jugs and an obvious escape up a slab.\n\nThis thing has one big hold on the traverse I opted not to use, because I didn't want it to break off in my face. That being said, it could be totally solid. Either way, it does not really change the grade.","protection":"I did it with 1 pad under the crux, but I'd guess 4 would make it safe.","location":"Climb the lip of the overhang from left to right, then traverse the crimps across the overhang, and top out over another boulder on jugs."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,e8ab21f6-7721-50d8-a47b-e73115d43110,db6b9397-3c2a-5a8c-a7e0-4a5819fc06d2","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Black Wave Boulder Area","Roadside Mystery"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.49861,38.90065]},"bbox":[-108.49918779409809,38.900200339818134,-108.49803220590192,38.901099660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117940405","area_id":"22uTlzwqWoyn4EpYGfwG0g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-108.49918779409809,38.900200339818134],[-108.49803220590192,38.900200339818134],[-108.49803220590192,38.901099660181856],[-108.49918779409809,38.901099660181856],[-108.49918779409809,38.900200339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:33.108Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:40.908Z"}
