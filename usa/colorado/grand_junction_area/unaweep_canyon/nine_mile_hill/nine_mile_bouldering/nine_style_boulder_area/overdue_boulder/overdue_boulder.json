It is mentioned by Kenny in the comments section of the Nine Style area. The problem starts from a low set of holds, right hand big pocket and left hand dish. Cross over with the left to the next large pocket and sort of dyno/deadpoint to the right hand 3 finger pocket. Get high feet, and make a 5-6 foot left hand movement to the crimp about 1 foot below the lip of the boulder. Make another big move with the right hand to the top of the boulder, and top out on good holds. This is one of the best problems at the grade that I have ever done.
