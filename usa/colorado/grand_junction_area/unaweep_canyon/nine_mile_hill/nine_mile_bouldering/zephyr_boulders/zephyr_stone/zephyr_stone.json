From there, work up the arete, and match on a pair of smooth jugs. Cross over the top of them to a left hand pinch, gain a three-finger pinch-edge right hand, set the feet, gain another right hand edge-pinch, place a heel on the initial jugs, reach the lip, and mantel on top.\n\nSome may just pull a large dyno and skip the intermediates altogether. This didn't work for me, as I used the previously mentioned method.","protection":"A pair of pads worked well for me.
