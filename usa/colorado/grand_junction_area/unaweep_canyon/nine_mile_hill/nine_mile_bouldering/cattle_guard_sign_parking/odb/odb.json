Look up more, get an awesome left hand jug (after crimp broke, opened up the glory). Now find a right hand undercling and crappy right foot, and throw left over for an ankle scraping heel hook. Move right hand to a two finger, tiny pocket to balance as you swing and make that big move up to a decent rail. Throw farther than you think, make room to match, carry your heel hooks, move with the obvious traversing line, slopers, fancy feet, move up through some great holds on the dihedral thing.\n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=8cgfC9Dâ€¦","protection":"I used three pads.
