Despite the rock quality, the movement is pretty fun.\n\nSit start with a left hand hueco and right hand crimp.  From there, work up to a jug and crimp that access the lip.  At that point, gain a decent sidepull, throw a high heel, and top it out using the bumps.\n\nThe crux likely involves the moves associated with the lip or the top out.  The lip can be negotiated by using it as a right hand pinch, and the top out is made possible by throwing a high right heel.","protection":"A few pads really helps level out the landing. It isn't bad, but it does have a few rocks that are directly below the problem.","location":"This is on the East face of Turtle Back Rock."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,267f32f4-f356-5ceb-9227-88b42fd6c8a3,404ef630-979e-5829-b9db-eae6631d8184","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Four Blocks Bouldering","Turtle Back Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.4895,38.932]},"bbox":[-108.49007804940112,38.931550339818145,-108.48892195059891,38.932449660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108235985","area_id":"QE72MJeeWCm52+rmYx2BhA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:35.173Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:20.233Z"}
