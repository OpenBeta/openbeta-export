Aside from\n\nCrack Hole Boulder\n\n, this is one of the better cracks I've seen for bouldering in the area.\n\nSit start with hands matched in the crack.  From there, follow the crack to where it veers left. At this point, make a deadpoint to the goods bumps, and top it out.\n\nUsing a right-hand gaston really helps with getting through the problem's mid-section.","protection":"Bring a few pads, the more the merrier as the landing is quite uneven, but it can be made fairly safe with the proper arrangement.","location":"This is on the East face of Humpty Dumpty Boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,267f32f4-f356-5ceb-9227-88b42fd6c8a3,3908eca5-4e13-50ad-b1ee-e02922137c9b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Four Blocks Bouldering","Humpty Dumpty Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.4861,38.9317]},"bbox":[-108.48667804695613,38.93125033981815,-108.48552195304387,38.932149660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108013542","area_id":"OQjspU4TUK2x7uApIhN8mw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:35.175Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:20.401Z"}
