Continue slapping up both sides of the prow until reaching a good left hand edge halfway up. From there, you can either continue with very wide compression, or start using the flake on the face and rounded holds on the right arete. Top out at the apex with help from feet on the rounded holds on the right arete.\n\nIt seems possible to pull over right onto the easier slab face at some points on the climb, but that would be much less fun.","protection":"Several pads and spotters.
