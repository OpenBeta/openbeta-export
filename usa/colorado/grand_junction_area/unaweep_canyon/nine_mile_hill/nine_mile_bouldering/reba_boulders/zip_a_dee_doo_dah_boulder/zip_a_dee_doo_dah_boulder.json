From there, gain a right hand sidepull, bump it further to a better sidepull, reposition the feet, gain a left hand bump at the lip, follow to a pair of bumps with the right hand at the lip, and continue onto the slab using the generous bumps above to reach an easy finish.","protection":"A pair of pads.
