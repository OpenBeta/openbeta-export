Crank up on the heel and head to the positive rail with a left hand.

I'm sure it depends on your strengths and size as to how difficult it is.","protection":"Couple of pads. It starts real low and it's not high at all, but you might want your head protected from the creek and rocks.","location":"When you top out, there's an easy downclimb.
