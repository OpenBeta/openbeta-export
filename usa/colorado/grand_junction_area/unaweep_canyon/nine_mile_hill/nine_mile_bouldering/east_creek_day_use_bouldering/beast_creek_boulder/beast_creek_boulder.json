Move up the arete by making a big move, throwing your left hand high and into the sloping crimps, right hand match (ish) the bump right hand to sidepull, now, the crimp of destiny. It is really good. Just trust your awesome feet you should have established by now, and pull up to that awesome right hand jug. From there, hang low, match on a bumpy feature moving left, and make a burly left hand jug throw. Top out on great holds and decent feet.","protection":"Pads. I found a bolt on this thing too.","location":"This area is just passed East Creek Day Use area, a little over a mile from US Highway 50, after exiting on CO 141. The area meets the edge of east creek day use area and continues over to the edge of Nine Style Bouldering area. Park on the right, after the second East Creek pulloff, and cross the creek.
