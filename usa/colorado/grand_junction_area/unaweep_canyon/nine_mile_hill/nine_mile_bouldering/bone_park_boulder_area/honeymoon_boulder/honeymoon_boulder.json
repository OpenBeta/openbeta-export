Put your left foot in a vertical crack in bottom left and a right toe hook in big volleyball-size hole in bottom of rock to keep from barn-dooring.  Move your right hand up to an obvious, two finger pocket.  Cross with your left to a good crimp just NE of the pocket.  Move your right hand to a decent rib running SE diagonal across the face.  Match with left hand on rib, and then do a quick pop up to the lip on natural \"V\" in top of the rock towards the upper right edge.  Finish out on/around the corner.  The crux is from first two holds to finger pocket.  It is as quick climb (about 6 moves), but it has a good feel and is fun.","protection":"Nothing really but maybe a pad.","location":"This is on the East side of Honeymoon Boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,aabf1ebf-f190-5fda-8999-a5f8417c913c,1dfc4a20-1848-5dac-afed-34b6d3cca0d8","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Bone Park Boulder Area","Honeymoon Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V-easy"},{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.49056,38.93007]},"bbox":[-108.49113803367236,38.929620339818136,-108.48998196632763,38.930519660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108358569","area_id":"HfxKIBhIXayv7TS208yg2A=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:33.893Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:36.175Z"}
