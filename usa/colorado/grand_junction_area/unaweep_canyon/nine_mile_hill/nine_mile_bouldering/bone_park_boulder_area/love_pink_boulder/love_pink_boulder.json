Throw a left heel on and lift off.  Slap out right to a good jug and pull up to another for your left.  Now get your feet under you and start traversing right.  There is a variety of juggy rails to choose from as you move right and shoot the gap between Love Pink and the smaller boulder behind you.  As you turn the corner, you can ascend and top out over the south face of the boulder.\n\nYou could probably keep traversing, but it gets way harder after that, or at least starts getting too sweaty.  I'm sure most people are ok with putting on a chalk bag, but I have a weird aversion to it when I'm bouldering, so I tend to stick to what I can do with one good coating of chalk.","protection":"The traverse is low to the ground, so you can pretty much step off at any time.  You could throw a pad under the topout.  Also be carful no to jack your back on the boulder behind you when you're shooting the gap.","location":"This problem starts on the northwest corner of the Love Pink Boulder, just outside the crack between Love Pink and Victoria's Secret."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,aabf1ebf-f190-5fda-8999-a5f8417c913c,e478c80a-1778-5e30-9e26-71bea7db5553","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Bone Park Boulder Area","Love Pink Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1+"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.4908,38.9306]},"bbox":[-108.49137803799151,38.930150339818134,-108.49022196200849,38.931049660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108283039","area_id":"5HjIChd4XjCeJnG+p9tVUw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:33.892Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:18.748Z"}
