The next few moves are the crux. Start with getting your feet up high lock off nail a small right hand crimp high on the arete, bring the left up to a sharp pinky, ring and middle finger tapered crimp with the left, that is about a foot and a half lower than the right. Figure out your feet and make an off kilter cross body, gravity defiant cross with the left to the bad sloper and then carefully rotate your right hand into the good sloper before moving up to better holds and a thank jeebus Hueco before topping out.
