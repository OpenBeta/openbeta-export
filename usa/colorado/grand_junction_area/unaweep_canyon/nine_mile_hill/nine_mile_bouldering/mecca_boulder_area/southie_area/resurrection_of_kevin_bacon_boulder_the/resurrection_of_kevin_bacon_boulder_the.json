Make a powerful cross move (see the pic) to a gaston/pocket, find the foot sequence, gain a left hand undercling, set your feet again, and make a powerful move to a gaston/slot. Bring your right hand up into the flake, followed by left/right. Rest up there, and then use body tension and right-facing edges to gain the middle upper, steep right lip.
