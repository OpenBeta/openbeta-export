It is contrived in that it avoids better holds above it; in this route, you only use the lowest holds on the arete of the boulder.\n\nStart with your right hand on a full pad slot crimp and your left on an overhung rail. Move left, and match on a good sloper, then move your right hand to a half-pad hold. Work your feet, and do a hard move to a great right-hand. Match. Move left (or right?) to a pocket with a 3/4 pad crimp, then match? Getting to the last holds is very hard due to a lack of feet. I'd love to see it done. After the match, top out over the edge.\n\nFor more beta, see this video demoing and failing the moves. Please comment/DM me if you send this, and name it, and I'll add you as the FA.\n\nThis route is not yet completed. Get out there, and do it!\n\nBeta video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XDwogme-pUs\n\n.","protection":"It has a great landing, bring two pads.","location":"This ascends the south face of the Clay Stone.
