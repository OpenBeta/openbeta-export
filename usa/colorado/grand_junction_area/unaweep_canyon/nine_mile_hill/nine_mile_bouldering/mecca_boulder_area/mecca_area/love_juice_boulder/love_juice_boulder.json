From there, move out right and match hands on the large, sloping jug. Then work straight up (crux) with a big left hand to the sharp, but good holds. Match hands again, throw a high right heel, and finish it on the jugs.\n\nThe crux involves some tricky but interesting footwork. Toe-hooking with a right foot out to the right allows the left hand throw to happen (without ripping your fingers off). Nonetheless, I would still recommend taping most of your left hand. The hold is sharp, and unless you're very tall, the feet are going to cut.","protection":"A few pads, the landing is great though.","location":"This is on the Northeast face of Love Juice Boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,12210cd6-f5dd-5222-b8be-e1811449c4b3,b5182eed-e99d-5d83-8db4-d61942dc4727,7cb3efc4-8141-5d22-aa5a-34da6a696a64","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Mecca Boulder Area","Mecca Area","Love Juice Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.50866,38.8919]},"bbox":[-108.50923772291239,38.89145033981814,-108.50808227708761,38.892349660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108120556","area_id":"fLPvxIFBXSKqWjTaamlqZA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-108.50923772291239,38.89145033981814],[-108.50808227708761,38.89145033981814],[-108.50808227708761,38.892349660181864],[-108.50923772291239,38.892349660181864],[-108.50923772291239,38.89145033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:36.077Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:44.611Z"}
