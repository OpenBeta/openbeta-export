From there, work the hands up the rail, tic tac the feet into place, then move a big right hand to a sharp crimp, follow with another big move with the left hand to the lip (crux), reel the feet in, match a right hand on the lip, throw a heel over, and top it out.\n\nThere is a lower start that begins with two pockets. I didn't feel like the additional moves added much value to the problem, as they were awkward, and didn't really add difficulty to the problem. Nonetheless, it is an option.","protection":"A few pads should do it, the immediate landing is great, but there a few rocks surrounding the fall zone.","location":"It ascends the center of the northwest face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,12210cd6-f5dd-5222-b8be-e1811449c4b3,b5182eed-e99d-5d83-8db4-d61942dc4727,b52ad99c-a0e4-56c7-8633-ad21b8b7eb87","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Mecca Boulder Area","Mecca Area","Triquetra Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.5097,38.89139]},"bbox":[-108.51027771876423,38.89094033981813,-108.50912228123576,38.89183966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109004377","area_id":"tSrZnKDkVseGM60huLfrhw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:36.073Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:38.385Z"}
