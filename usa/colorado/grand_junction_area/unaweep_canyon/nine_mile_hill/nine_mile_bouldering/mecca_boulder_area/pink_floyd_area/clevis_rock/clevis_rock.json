From there, pop off the ground with the right foot to a diagonal jug that doubles as a pinch.  At that point, work the left hand to a crimp, paste a high right foot, gain a right hand crimp (crux), then bump the left up to the lip, work slightly right, and top it out.","protection":"A few pads should suffice.
