From there, hit a right hand crimp, slap a left hand to the arete, bump the left over to the crimp rail (crux), stand tall with a right hand gaston, and finish it off with an easy top out.\n\nMoving to the crimp rail was the crux for me, as the body positioning is awkward.  This can be overcome by utilizing a left heel on a small bump near the arete.","protection":"A pad or two, but the landing is great.","location":"This ascends the Southwest arete of Crony Block."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,b9b123a7-fbea-5dff-81ca-bb33975aa143,f4c2e930-325e-56ce-850c-ca86bed85c98,12210cd6-f5dd-5222-b8be-e1811449c4b3,ac9ace35-5d69-5a0a-bcb9-b103148ffc09,cae092b8-2dd6-5c7f-bf24-bfbd986e8a98","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Nine Mile Hill","Nine Mile Bouldering","Mecca Boulder Area","Other Side Of Road Area","Crone Block"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.5059,38.8886]},"bbox":[-108.50647769607328,38.88815033981813,-108.50532230392675,38.889049660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108260337","area_id":"yuCSuC3WXH+/JL+9mG6KmA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:37.647Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:40.209Z"}
