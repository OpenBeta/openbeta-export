I haven't led this thing yet, since I haven't carried trad gear up there so far. Start with fingers and moves up through hands with some fun liebacking in the mix as well. The softness of the rock is not super inspiring for a leader, but it's a fun toprope or a possibe lead for those soft rock connoisseurs.
