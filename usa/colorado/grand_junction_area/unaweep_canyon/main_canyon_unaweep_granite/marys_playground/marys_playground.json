As you get higher, the rock gets better and more sharp. Layback and jam up a detached flake until you reach a saddle. Chimney up then stem and face climb on side pulls and edges to surmount the last bulge to the summit. At the summit, there is a small seam that is the only protection for a belay. To get down, you must use walk to the corner closest to the wall and use two ropes to simul rap (it is not advised to do this without having done it before) down. Use the little divot to guide the ropes and keep them from rolling off.","protection":"Doubles from #0.3 to #5 Camalots. With some extra small pieces.
