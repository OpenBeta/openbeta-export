KC dedicated the route to his friend, the visionary climber Mugs Stump, who had recently died near the time of the FA.\n\nThis is a 4 star route that has probably not seen 10 ascents in 15 years. It has fallen into disrepair. There are large bushes growing in the middle of the route and much of the crack is muddy. With regular ascents, this route would be a Unaweep classic. Even as it stands now, it is worth doing.\n\nBaum breaks the route into 3 pitches, but it could be done in two long pitches. Climb fingers and face until the crack opens more, eventually ledging out 120 feet up (optional first belay). Continue with good, steep hands and finger to another stance (60 feet). Here is where the bushes get gnarly. Climb steep hands, passing an OW with a rest. Now the crux: flared tips for 6 feet- very sequential! Once through the business, enjoy steep jamming of various sizes until you reach the most desperate mantle I've ever done. Good luck.
