This route has three potential starts: the right start follows a diagonal crack into a dihedral and is the original FA line, it’s about 5.8.

If one starts on the left and after the first bolt moves to the right it drops to about 5.7, but the rope drag really sucks. From the ledge where everything meets up, continue up a dihedral to another ledge then up left to the last dihedral.
