The crux is coming out of a flared chimney to surpass a #4 camalot crack over a bulge.  2nd pitch is a nice airy handcrack that goes up and traverses left and up a broken crack system. 3rd pitch goes up the prow until you traverse further left behind giant flakes staying below the tree and then a sloping chimney where you belay. 4th pitch you can choose your own adventure. There is a small crack far left and an OW that squeezes down to the right of it. The Route has a great mixture of easy and hard climbing.","protection":"Nuts, Small to medium Camalots, Singles of-( #2,#3,#4,#5)","location":"Route Starts at the Prow.
