There is a chimney to the left and a chimney in a dihedral to the right.\n\nPitch 1. Start in a chimney for 15 feet. If you are uncomfortable climbing 15 feet of 5.8 chimney off the deck, bring a #6 Camalot. Then climb enjoyable twin cracks for about 50 feet. The rock starts getting chossy and the moves get harder. I placed a #0 purple Metolius TCU and took a hang then hang dogged up the next few moves. If you trust small cams on soft rock, it probably goes at 5.10-.  Gain a 4th Class chimney, and go up to two old pins and a bolt, 140 feet.\n\nPitch 2.  Go up the obvious crack that diagonals left and then diagonals right, 90 feet, good fun, 5.8+.\n\nRap the route. On the second rappel, if you don't want to bring two ropes, you could bring a 40 foot piece of rope and extend the anchors to the top of the twin cracks, or maybe find a bush in the chimney to rap off of.","protection":"Two Metolius TCUs #0 purple and two #1 blue, two Camalots 0.3 to 4, maybe a #6, and one 70\n\nmeter rope.","location":"From the Gateway General Store, drive East 2 miles to a dirt road with a highway machinery shed. Drive up the road about a mile and park. Walk up 4 wheeler roads for about another mile. Head towards the Trident up gullies and ridges. Go around the south end of the formation to the West side. This takes about 2 hours."},"__v":0},{"_id":"VDvrdpYbWG6OODpD57uHSA==","name":"Banana Hammock","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Joel Irby, Dave Hoven, Evan Deis","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.97192,38.73167]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"110057183","mp_crag_id":"110057177","climb_id":"VDvrdpYbWG6OODpD57uHSA==","areaRef":"RSXWjKkIXOmnVgVSk7V7+w=="},"content":{"description":"This is THE line on this formation, it faces southeast and climbs excellent windgate rock for the majority of the climb with a spectacular summit pitch.\n\nP1. This pitch is OW the whole way. Straight in stacking gets you into the corner system. Where a full body workout begins in a flared corner, climb 80' to the stopper roof above. Climb out this roof on #5 C4 Camalots (5.11, solid) and into an alcove where an OK belay can be made on a couple #6 Friends, a small cam, and a pin, +/- 110' (5.11).\n\nP2. Climb up the squeeze a bit runout at first but fairly easy entering the squeeze (#9 VG) keeps the fall from being really bad. Squeeze to the anchor, there is not much gear on this pitch but not much is really needed, +/- 90' (5.8+). The FAs most likly combined this pitch with the 1st.\n\nP3. Face climb past two fixed pieces (5.10) to a finger crack, and then continue up this fantastic summit pitch on excellent Wingate with mostly hands and thin hands, +/- 150' (5.10).\n\nBoth belays are solid with shinny new hardware throughout the climb. This is a very quality adventure. Props to whoever got it up, it looks like we missed it by maybe a year. Awesome that lines like this are still available in the desert if you know where to look.","protection":"You could dump 5 or 6 #5 C4s on pitch one without really trying, definitely save two for the roof, singles from yellow Metolius to #6 C4 with doubles in the #1-#6 C4, maybe 6 #5s C4 for the 1st pitch, and lots of runners. Bring two ropes as both raps are 150+ feet.","location":"Hump your ass off, & hope to find the right wash to the base.
