Expect an adventure.\n\nP1. Start on the northwest side, climb up to the left of the large chimney, and then crawl over to get started. Follow cracks up through sporty/loose climbing until you make it into the chimney. Continue up and behind some chockstones until you reach a large ledge in an alcove where you can build a belay with a few hand-sized pieces at a bedding seam, 5.9.\n\nP2. Climb out of the alcove, and traverse around into a big chimney system. Continue up to a ledge and through a small slot where you can build a belay with a #6 Camalot. 5.8\n\nP3. Climb the offwidth/chimney, and traverse right around some choss up to a slope. Follow to the right into a chimney, and end at a the main deck. Belay with some small cams or a meat belay. 5.9\n\nP4. Summit pitch. Climb the tallest, mousiest looking summit. Aid on small pro up to the top, clipping one drilled angle on a blank section. The summit anchor is a sling wrapped around a bomber block. 5.8 C2","protection":"Bring doubles from #0-4 Camalots; 1 #5, 1 #6; triples in #0.75-2 for the first pitch; aiders for the summit pitch; some cord to replace anchors; and 2 70m ropes.","location":"Hike up Fisher Creek for a few miles. The tower is obvious on the right when two large drainages converge. Spot it out on the topo map first. To get down, do 1 short rap from the summit then 1 long double rope rap from an anchor just left of the summit (70m ropes)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,e8ca6047-b04f-5bd0-afb7-9b485b643d4f,4246501c-a558-5494-8fdc-ef635bbb8bbb,0b455a57-a039-5f77-9bbc-166e71cd2357,beb3916d-8d15-5269-9e74-541a377dfe5c","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Grand Junction Area","Unaweep Canyon","Gateway Vicinity aka The West End","Cottonwood Canyon / Fisher Creek"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.15155,38.73382]},"bbox":[-109.1521264421773,38.73337033981814,-109.1509735578227,38.73426966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111696968","area_id":"vrORbY0VUmmedFQaN33+XA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.1521264421773,38.73337033981814],[-109.1509735578227,38.73337033981814],[-109.1509735578227,38.73426966018186],[-109.1521264421773,38.73426966018186],[-109.1521264421773,38.73337033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:40.378Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:18.880Z"}
