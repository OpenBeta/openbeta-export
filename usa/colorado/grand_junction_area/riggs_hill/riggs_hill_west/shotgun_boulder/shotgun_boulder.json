Start with a two-handed undercling with your left foot smeared and right foot heel hooked around the arete. With your left hand, make a big move to a 3 finger crimp and switch the heel hook to a toe hook. Hit the sloper, and bump to the good ledge. Here's where it got hard for me. With the right toe still hooked, move either statically or dynamically to a small crimp and prep for the swing out. After that, make a big move (a campus if you can't get your feet back on) to the lip. Top out.","protection":"Pads and spotters.

If you're there, you should be right at a covered bench. From there, head left toward to cluster of boulders (they'll be on your left as you hike over). There's a small trail heading slightly up the hill.
