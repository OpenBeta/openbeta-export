(NOTE: there was chalk on the bottom holds, but nowhere else and there was a lot of cleaning to be done, so if anyone has info let me know.)\n\nStart with an angled right hand sloper and a left hand ledge/bump. From there, get your feet right and throw to the amazing ledge at the top of the \"cave\".\n\nThis move is harder because the rock behind you takes up a lot of space, and when you place a pad down on it, it takes even more space. There is a high probability of dabbing if you have a pad down. I'm not sure that matters, since the dab, in this case, actually hurts your chances of getting to the ledge by slowing down your momentum. If you can not dab, it's ideal but definitely harder.","protection":"Pads and a spotter.","location":"This is in the southeast \"cave\" of the Cali Boulder.
