I wrapped my rope around the step up on the ledge.)\n\nP2. Meet up with\n\nElmer Fudd's 1000 Yard Stare\n\n. Place some small gear in some soft rock (Ball nuts seemed perfect).

A body length or so of nutting with medium-sized offsets gets you to some free climbing. The rock deteriorates pretty badly towards the top, but the climbing is easy at this point.\n\nWe slung a blob on the summit for an anchor. A short rappel off the backside allows for a quick and easy walk back to the packs. There were a few old cams that a previous party used to rappel off previously, but the crack they were in seemed like a poor choice.\n\nI believe ours to be at least the fourth ascent, given the eclectic gear that we came across - some of it now bootied.
