Then angle left-ish, and follow the way of least resistance to the third bolt. A fall from below the third bolt could put you on the rocks in the approach gully. After clipping it, I climbed down and unclipped the second bolt, so my second wouldn’t be faced with a nasty swinging fall. Traversing to the first bolt was scary enough.\n\nAbove the third bolt, I climbed to a ledge and placed a #3 WC Friend (modern size) to protect getting to the fourth bolt. I could have placed smaller sizes, but I wanted to save those for the unknown yet to come. Getting to that fourth bolt was difficult and required trial-and-error routefinding.
