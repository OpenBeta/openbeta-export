It is a slightly contrived traverse problem, but the moves are very high quality. You start down below the bulge on two underclings, and make a strenuous first move to a right-hand slot. Move your feet out right, and bump through the slots. Get set up for a tough move out left to a sub-par crimp, then make a huge cross move (multiple betas work here) to the crux hold, a garbage right-hand crimp with a small thumb catch. From here, either use 6 foot beta to bump into the sloper above the right-hand hold, or lock off the right hand, get a high left foot, and slap that thing with your left. Finally, get your left hand to the final jug (don't dab on the rock!), and top out far left.\n\nIf this is not a first ascent, please feel free to comment down below, and change the info! I had a start hold break on me, and some of the other holds had literally 0 chalk on them, so we believe it is!","protection":"A pad on top of the rock for the crux.
