To make the database more user friendly, this is reentered as a route.\n\nI should have mentioned this in my other desriptions. By no means am I an expert on bouldering in The Garden. Heck, I'm not even a local, but the bouldering is not exactly complicated here, so I decided to post something about it. If you have any info in addition to what I've said, please put it up so others can enjoy the climbing here.\n\nWinter Warmer Traverse is located on a nice open sandy area. There are some really fun moves on a variety of holds. As the name suggests it is a traversing route (I went right to left, but you can go either way). It is a good place for winter bouldering, obviously. The rock here, and at the Blowouts, is of \"harder\" quality than the Snake Pit. By that I mean it is not as textured and does not feel as brittle. Once you climb them you'll know what I am talking about.\n\nFrom a comment originally entered when this route was an area:\n\nThe traverse of this area is a 5.9 on small flakes and edges near the ground. The landing is very good on flat sand.","protection":"None.  There is good, flat sand below the traverse.","location":"Winter Warmer is more or less on the southwest corner of North Gateway Rock.
