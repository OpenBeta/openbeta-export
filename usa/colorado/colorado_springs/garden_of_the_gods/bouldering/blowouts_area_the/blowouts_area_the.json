For first part use small ledge for feet and crimper moving to a sort of lie back (or into) with your left hand in a nice dish.  Use small crimper with right hand to transition body keeping feet high.  Move to an undercling with right hand then drop right knee placing on rock for greater support.  Follow obvious holds to the main pocketey part of the traverse (where traverse is generally started).  Continue traverse using high (easiest) middle (harder) or low (harder) finish.  Its fun stuff, you feel good when you complete it.","protection":"n/a","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ef64bac4-af2a-5523-9e4c-8e743ad36a27,0bd36e88-81be-51e0-b1ff-105fda88468b,73498310-e413-50ac-b208-2a9a70499b06,d017326f-83cc-5afd-8db3-a35250033649","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Colorado Springs","Garden of the Gods","Bouldering","Blowouts Area, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.85453,38.84698]},"bbox":[-104.8551073579532,38.846530339818145,-104.85395264204678,38.84742966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746248","area_id":"0Bcyb4PMWv2Ns6NSUAM2SQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:09.853Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:25.633Z"}
