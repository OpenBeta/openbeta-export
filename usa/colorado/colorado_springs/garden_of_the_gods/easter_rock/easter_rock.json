Climb a steep, unprotected face on loose edges to a large shelf.  Walk up the shelf to the base of the summit ridge, and climb a little more steep rock to the top.  Not much gear, and what there is won't do you a lot of good.  Still, not a terrible climb, and you bag a summit with a good view of the rest of the garden.\n\nAddendum: There are 2 starts to this climb.  You can start West Face Left, 5.5 R/X, or West Face Right, 5.5 R/X.  It is best to consider this a solo.","protection":"Not much.  You might be able to place tricams in potholes or loop a boulder with a long piece of webbing.
