Find the black, scarred outcropping containing\n\nScarecrow\n\nand\n\nMonster Crack\n\n, then move 30 feet or so right of the right edge. Be looking up for an obvious line of pins heading straight up the rock (that's\n\nFootloose and Fancy Free\n\n). The ramp to your left (heading up the outcropping) is\n\nLance\n\n. If you take a broad look at the face of the rock up and left, you'll note it's got a lot of green stuff on it. I'm no biologist, but I believe that's lichen. Get an idea of the overall size/shape, because you'll be traversing above it.\n\nClimb the first 3 to 4 bolts of\n\nFaFF\n\n. If you clip the fourth bolt (not a bad option) use a double runner, at least. I prefer a runner long enough to make the fourth bolt redundant to clipping the 3rd. At this point, look left and perhaps slightly up. There are 2-3 pins between you and the rock outcropping WAAAY over there. Fortunately the climbing is fairly light. Sadly, there is some rotten rock along the way. Feel free to sink cams in between the pins. They (most likely) will be lobe down, so plan accordingly.\n\nOnce you hit the outcropping, head up (the easy and obvious route being between the outcropping and the rock proper). If you're using a 50m rope, you can climb onto the outcropping and see the anchors for\n\nScarecrow\n\n. Unfortunately you'll probably end 20 feet shy. Climb back down into the gully and set an anchor (so bring some extra gear!). Your second can lead the last 20 feet.\n\nNot a great route, but if you're intent on topping the outcropping w/o getting a pump on\n\nMonster Crack\n\nthis is a decent option (\n\nLance\n\n, below you, is a bit of a stinker). Positive holds make this a lot of fun, but the sketch factor of the loose rock on the traverse hold it back.","protection":"At a minimum bring a rack of draws, a few long slings, and some large gear (to protect the balance of\n\nLance\n\n).  Optionally it may be wise to bring some small to medium cams to protect the traverse.\n\nPer\n\nBill Olszewski\n\n: 4 pins up and 2 on the traverse.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"467jT4lBU4mWkVKVkxslPg==","name":"Monster Crack","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Harvey Carter and Paul Radigen, 1950s","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.87967,38.87463]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"105753637","mp_crag_id":"107345199","climb_id":"467jT4lBU4mWkVKVkxslPg==","areaRef":"YEmIG9O9WfyQjUFpumYyZw=="},"content":{"description":"New as of 2018: this route on this face of the formation is closed to climbing due to wildlife concerns.

To get there, park at the Kindergarten Rock parking area.  Cross the road and before getting to the formation cut into the wash and follow the trail at the base of the rock around the backside.  Along the backside there will be an outcropping of rock (maybe 500 feet or so), the crack is located on the left side of this formation.\n\nThe rock is a little loose at the start and can be protected using some small gear (Aliens, micro cams).  As you climb higher, the crack widens and the bigger stuff is needed.  Save a very large cam for the last 15 feet before the ledge.  There are bolts on the ledge to anchor and rappel from.","protection":"Bring the big stuff.  A very large cam is needed to protect the last few feet of the climb.

Look for a large plate like outcropping.  In roughly the middle of the face is a black (magnesium?) scarred hand crack (located conveniently between Monster Crack and Lance).\n\nTo gain access to the crack you'll need to either power up and over a hollow sounding bulge (great texture and seemingly solid jugs) or start a bit right and climb a ramp (allegedly slightly easier, but I haven't taken this route).  Either way you'll have a hard time plugging solid gear for the first 20 feet.\n\nOnce you've reached the crack, the fun begins.  One of two crux's is shortly above the ledge (you'll note 1-2 pitons denoting hard climbing).  Climbing is a mix of face and jams on well textured rock.  Plow upward and you'll face an easier crux a bit shy of the anchors.\n\nBased on the number of ascents of time, I'd suggest that the rock is more durable than it sounds.  If you're not into placing gear in hollow sounding Garden rock, climb lance or monster and belay from the top.  You'll need two 50m ropes for the rappel.\n\nDid I mention that this was really well-textured rock?","protection":"Nuts and small cams will plug most of the crack.

Start on a ledge below a steep, green lichenous slab that leads up to a roof and a left-leaning, left-facing dihedral about 50 feet up.\n\nClimb the slab past 4-5 pins on mostly moderate climbing, but with some fragile edges and flakes. About 5.8 with maybe one move of 5.9. At the roof, get ready for steep, sustained, pumpy climbing. Ascend the 5.10 corner which is well protected and take a rest at its top at an alcove. Pull through the overhang at the top of the alcove onto the vertical face above, and follow it past a few more pins to the anchor on a good ledge. The crux is the move just above the alcove. The climbing above this eases, but it is still challenging due to the pump factor.\n\nDescent -- It is best to walk off to the south, as there are many very sharp edges on the face at the top of this climb. Top-roping, rappelling, or lowering from the anchor is not recommended. A climber died on this route in '93, due to slicing his rope at the top of the route. This was prior to the direct finish with 2-3 pins above the crux which were added after the accident. It is easy to see how one could be lured left onto unprotected and razor sharp face climbing, but just stick to the line of drilled angles, and you should be fine.  This route is one of my favorites at the Garden. Go get it!","protection":"About 14 drilled pins. 2 drilled pin anchor.
