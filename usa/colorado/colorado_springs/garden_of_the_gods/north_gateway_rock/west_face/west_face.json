The description in D'Antonio's book says the route offers \"great position and good climbing on somewhat loose rock.\"\n\nChange the words \"somewhat loose rock\" to \"horrifying chossy sand\" and you'll gain a more accurate description, if of only  the first and second pitches. I cannot say anything for the remaining pitches because we did not get that far.\n\nPitch breakdown:\n\n1)The climb traverses straight left from the belay on Rainbow Bridge for a pitch of \"5.8\". This is the only pitch we climbed of this route, because the movement was only slightly more difficult than Rainbow Bridge, rated 11a, but contained more loose rock on 70 feet than I have ever seen combined on all the routes I have climbed.\n\nThis pitch is a nightmare. Traverse left easily for 20 feet before clipping your first piton in a hollow sounding flake. Make some 5.9ish moves to reach the second piton, and then imagine how to gain the third piton with footholds crumbling away to dust. Spirit yourself past these difficulties and two more pitons to a wonderful, solid jug (the only one). Ponder the 10 foot runouts between remaining pitons and make your way past massive flakes held on with fairy dust, availing yourself only by using the smallest edges for your hands and sandy slab for your feet.\n\nFinally reach the two piton belay with many bail slings (including ours). Laugh at your partner as he sketches across and knocks grapefruit-sized flakes down, because only you know the desperate plight he is immersed in.\n\nAnd try to do this without ripping one of the many loose flakes to the vastness below, likely hitting a boulderer in the process. These flakes ranged in size up to approximately 30 lbs.\n\nIf you've had enough fun at this point, it is completely possible to rappel straight down with 1 60m rope. A 50m rope would not make it.\n\n2) From what we could see of this pitch, it resembled the last pitch, only worse. Make your way up and left on depressions resembling holes dug by a child on a beach then washed by five waves. All of this appeared to be coated by a layer of dust that is already having quite the bacchanalian in your lungs.\n\nFrom D'Antonio's guidebook: \"Continue left past 7 fixed pins to a 2 piton belay.(10c)\" If the last pitch you did was only 5.8, you are in for a ride.\n\nThe remaining descriptions are completely based off D'Antonio's guidebook.\n\n3) Go straight up to vine ledge. 11 pitons (11a)\n\n4) Head right on easy terrain to Pot of Gold (5.8).

You can also climb straight up past the last piton, but a fall here could be tragic.

If you fall off this pitch, it's possible that you could rip all the protection (although I hope the first piton would hold).  Falling directly onto the anchor in this scenario could possibly generate enough force to rip the anchor (although I personally think it would hold, but the Leeper-Z makes me wonder).  Similarly, don't fall prior to clipping the first piton on the first pitch.  The first pitch is also scary and runout, but doesn't feel quite as sketchy, and at least the anchor at the start of the climb seems bomber.  Either way, long whippers  are a distinct possibility on this climb, and will make you wonder if your protection would hold.

It climbs pretty much straight up to the saddle between Tweedle Dum Shire and the Upper West Face on North Gateway Rock.  The route is hard, sustained, runout, and sees few ascents, but the climbing is excellent.\n\nStart at the large pothole just off the ground and about 50' north of\n\nThe Warren Route\n\n.  Go up and right from the pothole past the first pin and make a difficult mantle, followed by sustained and steep edging to get to the 2nd pin.  Another difficult section gains some good edges with a few easier moves to the 3rd pin.  (Caution - a fall just before clipping either the 2nd or 3rd pins has potential for decking without a careful belay, so be ready).  Breathe a little, then continue up past another 5.11 move and sustained 5.10 climbing on sometimes fragile edges and flakes.  Gain another good rest at the second up-and-leftward angling, lighter-colored, sedimentary layer of rock.  From here, the angle eases, but the climbing will still get your attention until near the top of the pitch.  Although there are additional runouts on the upper parts of the route, all the pins are pretty solid.\n\nI consider this yet another testament to the very high standard of free climbing being displayed by our legendary forefathers in the late '70s.  To me, Amazing Grace is the perfect name for this time-honored test-piece.\n\n(FA info taken from\n\nSoft Touch III\n\nguidebook by Mark Rolofson.)","protection":"Quickdraws for 11 drilled pitons and a 3-pin anchor.
