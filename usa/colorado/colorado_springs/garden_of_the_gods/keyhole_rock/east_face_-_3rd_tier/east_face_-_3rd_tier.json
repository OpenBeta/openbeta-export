It feels a little wild the first time you climb it, with some decent whipper potential.  The rock quality is actually pretty good, but you're always wondering, especially because it probably doesn't get climbed very often.\n\nI enjoyed this climb and will probably do it again.  I'd recommend it for anyone wanting something a little more obscure, but still safe, and away from the crowds.","protection":"5 drilled pitons.  I also placed a #0.4, #0.5, and #2 Camalot, but these aren't totally necessary.  Natural anchor by slinging large blocky bulge at the top.  You can also use #0.75, #1, #4 Camalots.  The anchor scenario was really not that great.  It would be nice to add 2 drilled pitons, or some chains, and perhaps this route would get climbed more often.  However, it's a very easy walk-off.","location":"This route is on the east face of Keyhole Rock, at the southern-most edge of the formation.  There's a route on the South Ridge proper, along with one other route to the right of Macbeth that I'm not sure the name of.\n\nThe closest parking is at a pull-out south of the Keyhole formation on the one-way loop road."},"__v":0},{"_id":"iB4TbXq+VkKeHa/nF2a9QQ==","name":"Ellingwood Chimney","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.87,38.8788]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107955207","mp_crag_id":"107355956","climb_id":"iB4TbXq+VkKeHa/nF2a9QQ==","areaRef":"EDbRlsyPWIeu7vvzbs+H9g=="},"content":{"description":"This is a cool chimney system that lets you gain the high point of the Southern Keyhole Ridge.","protection":"1 fixed pin in the middle of the chimney.\n\nWe used 1 #4 Camalot, nothing else.\n\n(Watch for separating jug crack, once you get out of the chimney.)","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ef64bac4-af2a-5523-9e4c-8e743ad36a27,0bd36e88-81be-51e0-b1ff-105fda88468b,24887ff0-25ec-59cb-bcf5-5adfc65555e8,1036d196-cc8f-5887-aeee-fbf36ecf87f6","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Colorado Springs","Garden of the Gods","Keyhole Rock","East Face - 3rd Tier"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.87,38.8788]},"bbox":[-104.87057761639518,38.878350339818134,-104.86942238360483,38.87924966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107355956","area_id":"EDbRlsyPWIeu7vvzbs+H9g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:09.854Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:25.659Z"}
