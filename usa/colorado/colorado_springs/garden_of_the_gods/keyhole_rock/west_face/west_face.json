The name says it all. This is a fun, trippy route on the west side of Keyhole. This route tends to be a bit loose on the 2 & 3 pitches but makes for some interesting climbing.\n\nP1 .9R, climb to the one and only pin for this pitch, 12 feet up, then up to a good ledge (w/ tree), continue on up a 4th class wall to another good ledge. 110 feet?.\n\nP2 .10b, the fun begins, climb up this wall passing pins being careful not to pull your holds.\n\nP3 .11b. More of the same but harder and a little looser.
