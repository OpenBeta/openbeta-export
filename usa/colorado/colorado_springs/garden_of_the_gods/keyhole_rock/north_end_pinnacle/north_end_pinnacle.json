The climbing is technical and sustained for the first 30 feet, and gets steeper until you clear the overhang (which feels like a large roof at the lip).  The first piton is good, but don't blow it getting there.  I placed a #4 Camalot to protect the first move, but this soon becomes worthless, and you might want it higher up.  Above the first piton, you can get a great #8 Stopper at the lip of the roof (and/or some cams), but this is an awkward and pumpy spot to place gear.  You'll want it though, because the next fixed protection is a scary looking old bolt.  Pull one or two more steep moves up the groove before the angle kicks back and the climbing becomes easy to the top.  I was a little worried about a ground fall on this climb, but with a cool head and good placements, this really shouldn't happen.","protection":"Standard rack to a #4 Camalot.  2 pins.  2-pin anchor.","location":"This route climbs the big overhanging cave-like feature on the north end of Keyhole Rock, then continues up the groove/crack feature to a large ledge with a fixed anchor consisting of 2 pitons.
