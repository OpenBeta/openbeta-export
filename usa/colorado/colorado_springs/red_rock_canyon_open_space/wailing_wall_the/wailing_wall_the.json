Work up to the first bolt on smears and tiny edges and be sure to have a good spotter, that first bolt is about 15 up.  Continue up on small holds and sustained climbing, past a couple large vertical flakes.  Passing the fourth bolt the terrain is much lower angle, but still fairly dicey, as the holds are pretty much non-existent and it will be quite slick if theres a lot of dust on the route.  Above, move into the large flakes on steep ground.  Work up the left side to the anchors.  Avoid going right below the anchor; that undercling feels real nice but the huge flake is very hollow and the holds run out.  Laying back that flake might just send 50 pounds or more of rock flying toward your belayer.  Despite the occasional loose flake, this is a fantastic route and more difficult than any .10a in the northern part of the canyon, due to its sustained nature.

This one may have you fit to be tied, because it just doesnt let up; it is the most sustained route Ive climbed at RRCOS.  There are two ways to start this climb: either work straight up to the left-facing corner to gain the first bolt, or start about 5 to the right, using a great finger pocket to get into the large hole, then step left to the flake.  Work up and left to the second bolt and take on the first crux; getting established up and left for the third bolt.  Crux two comes at the fourth bolt, reaching a nice finger rail while having literally nothing for the feet.  From here, the route eases off, ever so slightly, through a sea of tiny edges and smears.  Passing the tenth and final bolt you will encounter the third crux, some off-balance climbing past two left-facing edges to reach the anchor.
