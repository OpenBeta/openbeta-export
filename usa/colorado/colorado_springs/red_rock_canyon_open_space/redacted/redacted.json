It is quite scary getting to the first bolt; 40 feet from the belay ledge, culminating in a tricky mantle onto a crumbling, hollow shelf before the first bolt can be clipped.  A fall here would be brutal, tumbling all the way back to or past the belay ledge, hence the R rating.  The crack system is covered in rat shit.  The last moves to the anchor are tricky as well, and not all that easy to protect.\n\nAll in all, this is a fun climb; it is out of character for the canyon.  It has good exposure.
