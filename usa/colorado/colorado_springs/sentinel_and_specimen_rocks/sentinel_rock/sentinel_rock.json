Do a boulder problem with micro-gear to gain the nice belay ledge below the obvious corner with splitter crack running parallel to it. This pitch could land you in the hurt, but some creative small gear might hold you off the ledge and a piece of medium-sized gear for the belayer will keep both of you from tumbling off the perch.\n\nPitch 2. 5.11-, 80 feet. Climb the beautiful corner crack occasionally using the splitter out to your left. Turn the chossy looking roof with some large gear, then tackle a thin, 10+ section of stemming. Head toward an obvious white spot for the belay if continuing up the more direct left variation route.  Climb straight up, and use a directional to move right on a ledge to belay for the glorious splitter way up and right variation.\n\nLeft variation:\n\nPitch 3. 5.10+, 50 feet. Head straight up and left from the white stain into a very nice, thin splitter that goes from fingers to hands. Turn this onto a very nice belay ledge.\n\nPitch 4. 5.10-, 50 feet. Head off the ledge up an overhanging, flared, chimney hand/fist crack that is actually much cleaner climbing than it looks. Top out the tombstone.\n\nRight variation:\n\nPitch 3. 5.11-, 100 feet. From the belay ledge up and right of pitch 2..., surf straight right on an amazing flake, then bust up a technical, thin seam to the base of the glorious splitter through the roof. Climb amazing thin hands through the roof and up a widening hands/fists crack to topout of the tombstone formation.\n\nDescent:\n\nTwo raps from healthy pines with rappel slings take you down the gully to the north of the formation. A 60m rope is sufficient.","protection":"Micro to medium nuts, double cams on up to be #3, one BD #4, and many slings.","location":"On the obvious Tombstone Formation on the left side of the Sentinel Rock, look for the splitters.
