The crux is hitting the huge bucket out right and not dabbing on the ground. Have fun with the sandy/chossy topout. Or, a newer, better finish traverses right after hitting the jug and tops out around the corner (still V7). Unfortunately, the picture added to this page (on 9/24/21) does not correctly show the two topout variations. See the main page's overview picture for the original topout route. The right finish climbs further right and under the corner then goes up. Basically, the yellow dashed line was drawn in-between the two finishes. Vuk's video in the comments is a good resource for the original finish.","protection":"Nothing really.

The tree poses a lot of dab potential but can be snuck by with care.\n\nThis climb has some unstable rock so use caution, and please do not intentionally remove anything suspect as it may be integral to climbing the problem. Also, use care not to aggressively brush. So, \"why would you want to climb such a pile?\" The climb is worth noting as it is similar quality wise to some other established problems at Ute Valley. It is also pretty beta intensive and climbs very well.","protection":"A few pads if no one is spotting.","location":"The boulder is between (slightly to the West) of the Main/Wedge Boulder and the Wave Boulder and has a cool tree growing over the upper left lip."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ef64bac4-af2a-5523-9e4c-8e743ad36a27,abd5d18d-ca93-57b3-a92f-1e1f96f3f8f2,1c08df8d-f312-5ad0-81aa-7626334b5696,fcabdaf9-61a1-57e5-9914-cd60ca9a1c01","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Colorado Springs","Ute Valley Park","South Side Area","Nick of Time Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"},{"count":1,"label":"V10-11"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.85699,38.91173]},"bbox":[-104.85756788428405,38.91128033981814,-104.85641211571594,38.912179660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107336527","area_id":"/Kva+WGhV+WZFM1gypocAQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:09.226Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:24.679Z"}
