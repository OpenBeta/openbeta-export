Good shoes will go a long way when looking for the pretty desperate footholds. The first two moves are the crux. Once you get your hands on the top, it's smear for the topout. Iâ€™d recommend 2 pads if you want to climb it safely, since there are some ankle rolling rocks in the fall zone. 1 will work, 0 if you are feeling spicy.
