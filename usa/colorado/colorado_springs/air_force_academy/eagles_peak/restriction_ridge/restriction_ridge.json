(Benâ€™s Ultimate Ridge Link-up) links all the faces on Restriction Ridge. The goal of the link-up is to traverse the entire ridgeline, climbing then seven main rock faces along the way.\n\nThere is no set way to climb the faces, though most have obvious crack systems that are the easiest way to the top. Plan for the route to take 8 hours trailhead to trailhead.\n\nThe route has great views of USAFA and multiple splitter finger cracks; however, you should be prepared for loose rocks on the ridgeline and crumbly rock of some of the faces.\n\nLoose blocks at the top of the faces also pose a real risk.\n\nThe B.U.R.L. is not for the faint of heart.\n\nP1.\n\nQuarantine,\n\n5.7\n\n, (39.00312, -104.91075). Climb the crack system to the top. Scramble along the ridge to the base of P2.\n\nP2.\n\nAthletic Probation,\n\n5.10\n\n, (39.00228, -104.91093). Climb the hand cracks to the zig-zagging finger cracks at the top. The is the best pitch on the route. Rappel the base of P3.\n\nP3.\n\nAcademic Probation,\n\n5.9 PG13\n\n, (39.00207, -104.91129). Start in the left dihedral working up and to the right to the finger crack. Gear placement is limited. Rappel to the base of P4.\n\nP4.\n\nHonor Probation,\n\n5.8\n\n, (39.00190, -104.91116). The hand crack in the left corner is the easiest route up. The face has no gear placement, but it goes on TR around 5.11. Rappel to the base of P5.\n\nP5.\n\nAlcohol Probation,\n\n5.8\n\n, (39.00194, -104.91144). Climb the hand crack in the chimney to finger cracks at the top. We found a stuck offset nut on this route, so the FA is unknown. Downclimb to the base of P6.\n\nP6.\n\nConduct Probation,\n\n5.6\n\n, (39.00163, -104.91153). Climb the broken blocks to the top. Downclimb to the base of P7.\n\nP7.\n\nHygiene Probation,\n\n5.7\n\n, (39.00147, -104.91179). Scramble up the kitty litter at the bottom to sketchy blocks at the top. This is not a great pitch to finish out the route, so be careful.\n\nDescent\n\n- find a steep, West-facing gully off the summit, and follow the base of the ridge back to Punishment Wall.","protection":"Stoppers #4 - 10 and cams 0.5 - 4 with doubles 0.75 - 3.","location":"Take the trail to the base of Punishment Wall, and then hike Southwest at the rock field.
