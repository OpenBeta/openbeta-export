They all merge eventually, so take your pick. The right, thin crack looks like it'd be the hardest. We did the far left crack as it looked like the best line.\n\nFollow the wide fist crack (1st crux) for 15 feet, and plop over the bulging slab at the top of it. Head up loose, easy rock to a very small, left-facing corner, head up to another right-facing corner, and go right at a small roof. Climb easy terrain to another roof with blocks on the right and a wide crack in the center (2nd crux). This is a very awkward move as you have to stay in the crack which moves diagonally. This is where our last belay was, yet not the end of the route. The last part is some easy scrambling to the summit.","protection":"BD cams #0.3- #3 and a set of nuts.","location":"It is on the far left side of Tenney Crags, right before the climbing becomes 4th class scrambling.
