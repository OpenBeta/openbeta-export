Fingers and thin hands lead to pretty good feet getting out towards the lip of the roof, then get ready for steep, painful hand jams through the roof.  There were a couple fixed nuts above the roof, which I equipped with a cordelette and rap rings (maybe 7 years ago), or you can continue up the corner and cracks above to the top of the pillar.  If just going up to the fixed anchor, it's about 80 feet.  I guess maybe 180 feet to the top.  I assume it would be bad rope drag to do it all in one pitch.\n\nThe other cracks on the pillar look ok too, but I've never climbed 'em.  The rating given is somewhat old school - others might find it more like 10a/b (?).","protection":"Standard rack.  Fixed wires with rap rings above the roof.

Climb up and left from the slab below the Nose roof to a belay shelf below Alabama Crack or from the gully below the crack, climb up and right past a couple old fixed Harvey pitons (5.9) to the belay shelf. Jam the crack 50 feet to a [ledge] with a 2-bolt rappel anchor that Brian Shelton and I put in a year ago.\"\n\nI climbed this today by climbing up to the Nose roof, clipping a blue sling fixed to a piton and wired nut underneath the roof, then traversing left under a nice flake to the large ledge on the corner of the formation and beneath the Alabama.  I belayed here off a fixed piton, and a couple cams (1\", 1/2\") to avoid rope drag for the upper section.\n\nThere are some scary loose blocks above the 2-bolt anchor which could seriously injure your belayer or possibly damage the rope if they were dislodged.  Some people might consider only climbing this to the 2-bolt anchor for this reason.\n\nI did not see any pins protecting a left start, as mentioned by Stewart.","protection":"Standard rack to a #4 Camalot and quickdraws for a few pins along the way.","location":"This is on the West Face of the Nose, right off the Mid-Columbine Trail.
