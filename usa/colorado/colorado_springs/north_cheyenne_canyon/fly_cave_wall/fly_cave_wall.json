Do a fun reachy move, and carefully pass a horrible thorn bush. Continue up the awesome, right-facing dihedral, being cautious of where you are grabbing (lots of dookey in some places, but super easy to completely avoid.). Climb into cleaner and increasingly overhanging terrain, and pull through the crux and onto the easy slab on top. There are lots of objective hazards, but it is a very fun climb if you're good sneaking past choss, thorn bushes, and poo.","protection":"There are a few strangely placed bolts on top of the formation as well as a giant rock horn you can sling to build TR anchors. Many bolt studs, nails, and other remnants exist on top.
