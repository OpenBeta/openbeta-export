This is an old and forgotten route with easy crumbly slab through a fun, short, blocky bulge and headwall with mostly questionable rock and equally questionable pro (PG-13). Pro is supplemented with some small to medium gear and, from what I could find, 5 very old looking pitons (pins). Sparse gear can be found. Finish by moving slightly right at the 3rd pin, then directly above by using long cord/sling to anchor off of the large tree.","protection":"A 70m rope is needed. 5 quickdraws for the old pins, gear from 0.5 to 1.5 inches. A\n\n70m gets you to a chossy ledge with easy scrambling if you and belayer are up the slab climber's right and extend your anchors at least a few feet off the tree.\n\nOr better yet, belay the 2nd up, and walk off to the west.","location":"Start by wandering up the crumbly slab left of the large pine at the base up to the left-arching roof, and go straight up to the big tree above."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ef64bac4-af2a-5523-9e4c-8e743ad36a27,6739ddfc-0780-59ce-8f38-1afbf957a9a2,6f05867a-cbd2-5d25-a323-a17145ff9c3f","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Colorado Springs","North Cheyenne Canyon","Roadside South Face"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.87381,38.79114]},"bbox":[-104.87438690540928,38.79069033981814,-104.87323309459072,38.791589660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117635421","area_id":"bwWGesvSXSWjI6FxRf+cPw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:08.811Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:03.426Z"}
