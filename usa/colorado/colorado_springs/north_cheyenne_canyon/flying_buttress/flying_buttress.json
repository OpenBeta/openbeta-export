Hanging Gardens starts straight up.  Look for a line of bolts more to the left.   Climb the line of bolts to the left of the arete going up to a slab for the finish.  Both climbs use the same anchors for the top.  Either climb Supersonic as one 200 foot pitch or split it up into two pitches.  There is one closed shut that could be used as a belay a little ways up the route.\n\nThe first part of the climb is a little run-out.  Overall it is of better quality, though than Hanging Gardens, which is looser at the top.  It gets one star because of the funky beginning.","protection":"You may want to supplement quickdraws with a selection of small to medium stoppers.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Z3RBaIy0UHqSAsv8BUNAtg==","name":"Hanging Gardens","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.87789,38.78972]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105754624","mp_crag_id":"105745648","climb_id":"Z3RBaIy0UHqSAsv8BUNAtg==","areaRef":"tD2Dv3kOVJ+Bagso/gJjyQ=="},"content":{"description":"Hanging Garden is a nice route of moderate difficulty.
