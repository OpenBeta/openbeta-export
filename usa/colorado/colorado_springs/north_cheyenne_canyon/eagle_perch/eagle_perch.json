The crux of the route is getting established on the vertical face. While Ian originally graded this 13b, I am not sure that this would clock in at V8.\n\nThis is a fun, technical, powerful route in a superb, excluded setting.\n\nI am not sure how Ian and Stew ever found this little crag, but I am glad they did. KUDOS.","protection":"You will need three draws for the route and two for the bolt-hanger anchor. You can easily set-up a toprope for this route by walking to the top of the rock and reaching down to the anchors. There are hangers on top but not lowering anchors, so you will eventually have to do this little hike regardless to retrieve your gear.","location":"This route is easily located once you find the boulder. Look for three bolts perched on the steep to slaby face. The face will look easy and short at first glance, but once you get off the route, you will have a better perspective."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ef64bac4-af2a-5523-9e4c-8e743ad36a27,6739ddfc-0780-59ce-8f38-1afbf957a9a2,2b16f330-20cf-5cec-ba61-d468f2fcdeac","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Colorado Springs","North Cheyenne Canyon","Eagle Perch"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.8758,38.7925]},"bbox":[-104.87637691641616,38.79205033981814,-104.87522308358379,38.79294966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105949023","area_id":"KxbzMCDPXOy6YdRo8vzerA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:08.813Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:03.550Z"}
