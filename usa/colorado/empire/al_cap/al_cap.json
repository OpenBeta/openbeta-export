Since it pushed me off immediately, I set up the top rope to work out the beta. The climbing reminded me of a more vertical Twitch, but with even smaller holds and some perplexing body position. For an over grown boulder problem, it seemed very continuous for all of its 35 feet. Bullet-proof stone, complex sequences, reasonable pro, very fingery.
