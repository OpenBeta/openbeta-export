Climbing it barefoot is doable, but tape up your big toes to prevent cuts and whatnot. Climbing the route with shoes will make your life a lot easier. If you don't have a crashpad, have someone spot you on your first few runs, because falling will definitely lead to sprained or broken angles, as the ground is very rocky. After a few runs, you will get a hang of where the holds are and cruise up the route; however, I somehow climbed it slightly differently each time!","protection":"Have someone spot you!
