There seems to be a couple ways to climb this section of the wall, but we followed the wide crack down low and the obvious flaring corner/chimney higher up.\n\nStart behind a boulder at the base of 2 parallel cracks (6 inch crack on left and hand-size on right). Climb the wide crack on the left for about 25 feet. At this point, you could take the seemingly easier route straight up if desired.... We went left and climbed a nice large flared corner/chimney for another 25 feet requiring some good ol' fashion jamming (hand/fist) and chimney technique. It gets much more narrow for the last 10 feet but then quickly puts you on easy terrain at the top of the Hen and Chickens formation.
