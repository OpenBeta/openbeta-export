To start, descend from the R into an alcove and start or go further L and to the very base of the rock.From the very base of the rock, you can ascend unprotected slab to the alcove mentioned above.  From the alcove, briefly take a R angling crack, reminiscent of the Tilted Mitten start on Twin Owls.  Continue up a groove to a roof.  You could turn the roof.  But to the R find a unusual hand traverse (crux) R to a bush.  Then fire up a short crack to a slab.  65 feet with 30 feet of exit slab.  Watch for rope drag.  Certainly may have been done before but rock thrown off suggest possibly not.
