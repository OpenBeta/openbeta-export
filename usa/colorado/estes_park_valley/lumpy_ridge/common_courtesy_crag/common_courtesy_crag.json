It starts just left of the obvious wide crack in the center of the cliff (Dave With His Pants Down). Climb a pair of seams up to a right-arching undercling flake. Load the undercling up with gear then devise a way up and out left around the corner to where you can eventually reach around into a finger and hand crack that angles further around to the left and the top of the buttress. The crux is the thin, thought-provoking face climbing en route to the reacharound. Belay from the top of the buttress, and a scrappy traverse off to the left gets you back to the ground.\n\nThis pitch was established yo-yo style from the ground up; it has since been onsighted. ItÂ’s barely over 40 feet long so if you have a fundamental problem with short pitches, you might want to try something else.","protection":"Light rack including a few RPs for the start and a hand-sized piece for the crack around the corner.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"h8HFjxbcVHu4NvDKpP5Icg==","name":"Dave With His Pants Down","yds":"5.10-","grades":{"yds":"5.10-","french":"6a"},"fa":"John Tormalehto & Jim Belcer, 1994","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.5182,40.4032]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105828387","mp_crag_id":"105791755","climb_id":"h8HFjxbcVHu4NvDKpP5Icg==","areaRef":"bNmKCI+aXLKJatA8babODw=="},"content":{"description":"This excellent crack pitch is located in the center of the south face of the crag.
