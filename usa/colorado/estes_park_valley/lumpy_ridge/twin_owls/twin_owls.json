However, given the amazing Tom Hornbein was involved, it is a bit less surprising. This line ascends an obvious chimney that is one of the biggest features on the South face of Twin Owls. For those unused to squeeze chimneys, this will feel like a sandbag. Just recall when this was first done & with what equipment they had then. It will give you great respect for those who climbed before you.\n\nHike up the main Twin Owls trail as for the South & East faces of Twins Owls & Hens & Chickens. Before you reach Hen & Chickens you follow a fainter fork in the trail to the left towards the obvious ramp, Roosting Ramp. Pass the ominous\n\nCrack of Fear\n\nand continue left or West. This chimney is just past a large boulder lodged near its base.\n\nFor lots of beta:\n\nP1. Pull into the chimney past some large flakes. Move to the deep edge of the large block in the chimney. You can place a mediocre medium hex for mental protection. Highstep on the short, slippery, pigeoned arÃªte without pro until you reach the obvious top of the flake where you can put #1, 2, and/or 3 Camalots. Hand traverse left, step up/flop onto the top of this flat-topped block. Belay. There is a pin at head height left, you can thread a sling through a constriction on the right, and you can clip a fixed wire in a crack to the far right on\n\nAutumn Mist\n\n. Stiff 5.2 (one guidebook) that feels 5.6s, 50 feet. Not belaying here will likely add excessive rope drag. At one point this belay had 2 pins, not any more.\n\nP2. This is the heart of the route. Pull up into the slippery chimney facing left in, gain the top of the flake, then turn right into the chimney. This will be tight for folks of larger girth, like me. Slither, fight, wedge, grunt, and extrude yourself upward. Use decent right foot jams that at times are your only solid holds. Clip a pin. Fight onwards. At one point, this fissure is tight enough that you won't be able to turn a helmeted head, so face inward so you can see your pro. Grab a more-or-less squared off edge near the top of the offending fissure, and flop your feet out left. Freedom! You can create an optional belay below the next pin if you are pooped. Note, you may be able to reach a chained anchor and Fixe rap ring anchor off to the left of the top of the squeeze chimney, if you need to bail (no more fixed rap anchors above). Continue up, clip an upward-driven pin, lieback, pass another pin, and get a good rest above. Interesting climbing with a mix of awkward lieback, face climbing, chimney, and crack gets you to a tunnel under a chockstone. Find a pin that looks like it is driven in rubble and birth yourself into a slightly sloping alcove. There is an ancient bolt on the right wall without a hanger just above the chockstone. Above, possibly a #10 & #11 hex and a large cam can be used for the belay although there are other alternatives. It's a stiff 5.7+ and is approximately 160 feet. Oddly, the lower half of this pitch is reminiscent of the squeeze chimney section on the\n\nCasual Route\n\n, minus the altitude and moisture.\n\nP3. This is the nice pitch. Move down & jump onto the left wall of the widening chimney, and follow a crack upward. Find pleasant, steeper climbing with smaller pro (#3 Camalot or smaller) with great rests. At the top of the crack, move left, pass an ancient bolt with a rusty smash-link, and finish on low angled slabs to the top, 5.7, 195 feet. You can go up the chimney above and pass the chockstone on the left or right but this looks much, much less inviting.\n\nDescend right down the first gully, 4th Class, to the\n\nBowels of the Owls\n\n.","protection":"Rack up to #5 Camalot, with single set of cams, although this can be done with a rack to #4 Friend and hexes (the way my partner first did it).

It can also be used to ascend Twin Owls with reduced technical difficulty.  Due to the above uses, traffic jams may be encountered.  It is likely the technically-easiest way (vs Cheechako) to summit the formation.  It can be wet and/or cool.  In a wet winter, it can have snow or ice.  Also, it may be ascended by small climbers as young as six years of age.\n\nApproach via the Gem Lake Trail from the Twin Owls parking lot, pass the Lower Twin Owls climbers access trail, go uphill at the Upper Twin Owls climbers access trail (also approaching Gollum's Arch).  Go past the trail that splits to the left (to the Roosting Ramp), pass Hen & Chickens, and pass the approach for the East Ridge.  Find a deep cleft near a standing, broken off dead tree around on the NE side of Twin Owls ascending a weakness between the East & West Owls.  High traffic down this cleft may also make it more obvious.  In the near future, access may be out of a westerly trail out of the soon-to-be-built trail from the new (further East) trailhead.  Pay some attention to the trail as you ascend, or you will wind up on the old (less preferred by the some) trail.\n\nTo approach from above, to use this as a descent, you go to the third class saddle area between the  summits of Twin Owls (separated by about 100 feet).  It can be less-than-obvious.  From here you go down a wide, steepening gully 4th class to the NE (towards Gollum's Arch) about 100 feet to a even steeper section, traverse left around a small rib on a slab to a chockstone and what looks like a cave or big rabbit hole.  Downclimb through this cave into a dark, narrow, left-angling chimney about 70 feet.  If it's too wet or whatever, you can rappel slinging a chockstone above the chimney (better) or the block that you hop over to get into the chimney (worse).  It's a funky, slithering rappel.\n\nTo ascend:\n\nP1. Go up the chimney with some loose gravel in spots.  About 50 feet up, you reach the first technical challenge with a crack/flare on the right with slicker foot holds on the left.  Chimneying can be a bit of a challenge if you are large.  Reaching up can be challenging if you are tiny.  This can be funky if wet.  A hand sized cam works here.  Then, just above, you find the 'crux' with smaller holds on a slick slab for a short stretch to a bucket.  This, too, can be funky if wet.  A yellow TCU/Alien or cam be helpful to protect your second, especially if tiny & inexperienced.  Traverse left to the exit of the chimney & belay, 70 feet.\n\nP2.  Traverse left about 15 feet on a slab around a small rib (exposed for the tiny or timid).  Ascend the gully 3rd to 4th class to the saddle.  About 120 feet.\n\nP3.  From here, you can make a 3rd class scramble to the East summit or a more exposed, and somewhat more difficult bit to the West summit block.\n\nTo descend, downclimb back to the notch.
