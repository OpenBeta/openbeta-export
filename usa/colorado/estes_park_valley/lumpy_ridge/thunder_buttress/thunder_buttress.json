Climb black-streaked rock to the left of this, and continue up two pitches of grooved low-angled rock, trending right and taking the line of least resistance, until you arrive at a large ledge at the base of the headwall arete or ridge. You can easily walk off west from here.\n\nFollow the arete for two more longer pitches, looking for the crux roof at the end of the third pitch. Because it's not climbed much, the route is lichenous, sometimes loose, and somewhat difficult to follow.","protection":"Standard rack","location":"To descend, traverse the fourth class ridge north until you get to easier ground, heading down the west gully."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,9ef89b9d-db55-57cb-b9d3-dac26aa710a4,0c4f3b0c-51fe-5ce7-8e29-0e825157f615","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","Lumpy Ridge","Thunder Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.54938,40.41179]},"bbox":[-105.54997056642148,40.411340339818146,-105.5487894335785,40.412239660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105879803","area_id":"DE87DFH+XOeOKQ6CUVf2FQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:52.292Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:58.537Z"}
