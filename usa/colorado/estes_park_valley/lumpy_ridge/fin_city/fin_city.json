The start is the crux of the climbing.  You can start from the ground with some help from the next crack left or step off the boulder behind and jam.  A #0.75 Camalot can be set off this boulder to protect the tricky start.  Note, there is a nice lieback rail on the right wall about 1/2 way up.  Also, the last few feet of climbing involves standing on & climbing a huge flake, which appears balanced & detached.
