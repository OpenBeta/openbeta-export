Worth spending some time on, this one feels good to send.\n\nI'm not sure of the history of it, but there are potential variations on this line. I started with both hands as high as I could reach (gouging right finger lock, left hand poor/open grip), establish your feet, and fire straight up to a poor edge. Then do the crux throw, and finish left on the overlap feature, same as the V4 on this wall.\n\nThis faces south - you don't want to climb this when it's hot.","protection":"2 pads.","location":"This is not strictly on the Bolt Boulder, but I can't stand it when we build a subsection for every single bloc that is a two minute walk from the others. Everything from\n\nPodophile\n\n, Pop A Loose Nut, the warm up boulder on the trail, and Sap are all in the Bolt Boulder area.\n\nStart by finding the Bolt Boulder, which is a couple minutes up the hill from the T intersection that you reach if you take the main LEFT trail at Lumpy. At the T (left goes to Black Canyon, right goes Gem Lake), take a right, you'll see Bolt Boulder on your left after a steep incline. Hike past this, and take the climber's trail left above that. Then look for Sap, V9/10 on the left (chalked, obvious pretty roof), and continue on the trail for another ten seconds, looking left. Use the photo to ID - you can see it uphill from the east-west climber's trail."},"__v":0},{"_id":"dlkKQxb3WACjbycQ75sG5g==","name":"Podophile","yds":"V9","grades":{"yds":"V9","font":"7C","vscale":"V9"},"fa":"Tommy Caldwell","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.51966,40.40185]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"106788294","mp_crag_id":"105877173","climb_id":"dlkKQxb3WACjbycQ75sG5g==","areaRef":"kPSA+/sHWMGmch0OSn3tbQ=="},"content":{"description":"Climb bad slopers on the west face, right of the giant overhang.
