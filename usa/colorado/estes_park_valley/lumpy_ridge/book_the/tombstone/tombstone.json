Continue up the chimney (a little run out here) to gain an offwidth crack to the shoulder of The Tombstone.","protection":"Large gear is needed to protect the route.  A single set of cams from fingers all the way to a #6 C4 should be adequate.  If you are doing the direct start another wide piece would probably be needed.\n\nThere are no anchors at the top of this route and no walkoff.  Improvising a rappel may require some creativity.","location":"This is the obvious, splitter crack on the southwest face of The Tombstone.
