Has really good feet down low.  There could be a route that moves straight up the outside arete but we tried to incorporate the 3 good edges on the main overhanging face.","protection":"Two pads is probably good, the top out is a little sketchy, and the pads tend to slide down the hill if you have a bad spotter.","location":"The boulder is probably hard to find.  There is a huge mass of granite directly above it.  There are two cabins up hill and to the right of the 2801 sign.  Follow straight up and slightly left from those cabins and the boulder is about 150 yards uphill.
