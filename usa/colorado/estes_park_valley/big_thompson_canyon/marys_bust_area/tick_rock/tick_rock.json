Hmmm.\n\nThis was a decent, heavily bolted line with a line that felt contrived for the bulk of the first pitch, but it makes up for it with its short second pitch.\n\nAccording to\n\nLew Strong\n\n, \"the overbolting was due to some scary lead bolting. The plan is to sort the bolts out a bit at some point.\"\n\nStart in a little alcove.  The more you try to stay on the face, the more difficult the first pitch will be.  At times, it feels like you may not find a way to avoid the groove on the right at less than a 5.11 grade.  At least you will never feel runout on this climb; however, you may develop a guilt trip.  After about two-third's the way up the first pitch, you will swing right onto the arete and right face. There are interestingly 4 bolts from which you can anchor.  The belay to the right with feet on a ledge will feel more comfy.\n\nFor pitch two, you will no longer be able to scum off the right groove.  You must climb the arete.  The difficulty is less.  There is a funky second bolt mid-pitch.  You may find a friable feldspar flake in here.  A bit of breeze will make this pitch more memorable.  Unfortunately, the pitch ends far before you would like.\n\nAddendum: P1 has been rebolted, the holes patched, and it no longer resembles the initial effort.  The change is that p1 cuts left up the center of the slab and has several 10a spots in the upper third. It is 95 feet and 10 bolts. At the top of the flake there are two options for P2:  1. continue straight up 50 more feet with 5 bolts at 10c.  2. step right to the anchors, turn the corner and climb the right edge of the arete at 5.9 with 5 bolts.
