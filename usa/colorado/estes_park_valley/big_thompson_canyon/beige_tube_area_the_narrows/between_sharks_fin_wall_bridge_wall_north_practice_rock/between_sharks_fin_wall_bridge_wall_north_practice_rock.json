The second one is deleted to reduce redundancy in the database.\n\nThere is a \"half\" of a crack between\n\nMists of Mordor\n\nand The Practice Wall.  Climb up the crack for about 12-15 feet and there is a place for a descent stopper (one of the better I got). From here, I went right on to the face I thought it was easier than continuing up the crack proper. Either way this is no-man's land as there is nowhere else to get any gear until you are about 35 feet off the ground and looking at a certain ground-fall. (No Bull-Shit!)\n\nThis is where it got interesting I had to put in a completely (all feel) blind stopper while standing in one of the harder spots of the route (probably just nerves). From here, continue straight up the crack where you can actually get a couple decent pieces in before the anchor.  I left two stoppers for an anchor, but you might want to bring some webbing to equalize them better.\n\nPer\n\nTymothe Meskel\n\n: I don't really know what to say about this route. It sucks, it dangerous, the gear sucks, and the entire time Buzz was on the route I thought he was going to deck out.\n\nThat being said, sometimes partners should listen to each other.\n\nYour first piece good piece is about 15 feet up. After that, good luck.\n\nPS: If someone anchors this, can I have my nuts and sling back?","protection":"Nothing but Stoppers, a lot of them were bigger, but one was a #4 turned sideways, as were the rest because the placements were so shallow.\n\nPer\n\nTymothe Meskel\n\n: Trad: mostly nuts with a number one cam.","location":"Down from Half Pipe, up from the Practice Wall.
