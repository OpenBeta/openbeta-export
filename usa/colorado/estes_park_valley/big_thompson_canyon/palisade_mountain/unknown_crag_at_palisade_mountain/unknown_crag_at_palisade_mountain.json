One 5.7 move (R)gets you to great holds.  mantle up on the holds under the large right slanting flake.  Place a large cam or two and lay back the flake till you gain the short OW Chimney.  Good crack in back of the OW for a 1/2 -1 inch cam.  A long reach or a short wiggle up the OW gains a bucket to pull on to top out.  Rappel off of trees or rock or continue slogging uphill to some incredible looking walls.","protection":"1  or 2 1/2-1 inch cams for the lower crack and the upper Off Width.  2-4 inch cams for the flake.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,279c5542-b8d6-5385-b9f0-746ce842d276,8281dd87-cf95-598e-b0a3-9a419010b273,ea6cd49b-8818-5d01-b269-36ef5e5f194c","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","Big Thompson Canyon","Palisade Mountain","Unknown Crag at Palisade Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.31171,40.43666]},"bbox":[-105.31230078481403,40.43621033981814,-105.31111921518597,40.43710966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106521817","area_id":"6mzUm4gYXQGyaTbvXl8ZTA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.31230078481403,40.43621033981814],[-105.31111921518597,40.43621033981814],[-105.31111921518597,40.43710966018187],[-105.31230078481403,40.43710966018187],[-105.31230078481403,40.43621033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:58.961Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:41.484Z"}
