This ledge gives the pitch its PG-13 rating, as the dual flares above it have devious climbing and protection. I had to hang here on my onsight effort in order to suss it out. Hence the current C0 rating. Conquer the flares, and the jam/layback crack above, and then jog left under an overlap. Climb the burly splitter out the overlap and up the short headwall above to arrive at a slab in an alcove. There's a crack in a corner, shooting out the roof above, which is the obvious finish to this pitch. BUT, in my cowardice, and doubt about anchors above, I built an anchor in the roof crack and traversed way off right to belay. I believe a bolt anchor just above the roof crack (and a no-hang free ascent) would make this pitch complete. As is, scramble off right and back down to the base.","protection":"Standard full rack.\n\nIt needs a bolt anchor at its top.","location":"Around the corner, to the East, from the other pitches on this crag is the steep brown and yellow East wall with a crack system meandering up its center."},"__v":0},{"_id":"gRBtcYKIXbmU91Ml+P3TzA==","name":"The Distriminator","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"M Carnes, Matt Coffman","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.31171,40.43666]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107277590","mp_crag_id":"107277570","climb_id":"gRBtcYKIXbmU91Ml+P3TzA==","areaRef":"OwnVFlUjWVCkySB7YGiG8Q=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the incredible finger crack straight up the center of the face.
