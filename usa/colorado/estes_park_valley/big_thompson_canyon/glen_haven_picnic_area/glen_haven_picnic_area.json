We named it Bosh Fire (.12c). Skip Harper loaned us his old drill and while the anchor was being put in, the drill started to smoke and caught on fire. After quickly removing the battery and pouring a water bottle on the the drill, I took it apart, taped up the melted wires and it worked fine again. I don't think Skip ever heard about that one!\n\nBosh Fire does traverse in from the right, which is the crux, and a belay bolt should still be there. The last time I drove by the route, it looked like one of the traverse hangers was missing.\n\nIn the winter when the creek is frozen, the direct start can be used which makes the route a fun .12a.","protection":"Five or six bolts, bolted chain anchors.","location":"Across the creek right in front of the parking lot."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,279c5542-b8d6-5385-b9f0-746ce842d276,49d58af2-c0e4-5a83-89bc-4cbfbf2d4891","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","Big Thompson Canyon","Glen Haven Picnic Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.22604,40.42152]},"bbox":[-105.22663065183168,40.421070339818144,-105.2254493481683,40.421969660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105837343","area_id":"SdWK8sDkWoOJvEy/vy1IkQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:58.959Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:48.550Z"}
