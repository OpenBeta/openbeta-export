Start on sharp, half-pad underclings roughly 6 feet up. Step up and move into the large, obvious sidepull then up to a great sloper at the lip. Throw a heel hook. Work your way up until you can eventually grab a massive, incut jug in the rock that is not visible from the start. Mantel over. This is exciting and challenging the whole way through.\n\nWhen I found this boulder, it was dirty and lichen covered. I am not from the area and have no idea if this is a first ascent. For now I will assume so, but please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThis is my first FA. Let me know if the grading seems accurate!","protection":"A pad or two.
