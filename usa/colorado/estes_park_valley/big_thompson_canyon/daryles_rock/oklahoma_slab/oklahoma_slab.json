As it turns out, Daryle thought his reserved cabin at Sleepy Hollow was a little \"too rustic\" and feeling cheated, left without notice to stay in Denver. Lucky for him, he was \"eating at Casa Bonita\" during the storm. Daryle was found alive and well in Oklahoma, by a journalist researching the victims for a story 25 years after the disaster.\n\nClimb the center of the slab on good holds down low, past three bolts to an undercling rest. There is a pod up and left of the hold for a #6 TCU. Continue up past three more bolts (crux)to a broken band below the summit. Climb slopers and horns to the anchors. A #3 TCU will fit in the crack just below and right of the two bolt anchor.","protection":"Six draws, a #6 TCU, a #3 TCU.","location":"The far WEST side of the formation, a south-facing slab with a large pine at the low point."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,279c5542-b8d6-5385-b9f0-746ce842d276,bbc95a98-ea94-508f-8942-95247502ae2f,42772053-ade3-53ef-bc6d-af2032a89b27","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","Big Thompson Canyon","Daryle's Rock","Oklahoma Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.22604,40.42152]},"bbox":[-105.22663065183168,40.421070339818144,-105.2254493481683,40.421969660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106699464","area_id":"QncgU63jU++8ba8gMqibJw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:59.605Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:48.901Z"}
