Begin this route with overhanging thin cracks (harder than it looks) which provide the tasty crux.  Soon, enter and struggle up a wide flare, then mantel onto a ledge with a small bush at 30 feet.  Continue straight up (10a), and where the crack arches left and turns into a seam, traverse 10 feet right on a ledge and belay at two bolts -- 50 feet.
