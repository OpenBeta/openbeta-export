It probably gets very little traffic and starts in the shade. The description from guidebooks may be a bit hard to follow, but the route essentially travels the right side of this modest crag in 2-3 pitches. The description here may be a variation of the actual line, but it works.\n\nP1. Ascend a slab with light protection opportunities. Perhaps 50-60 feet up, you have to choose to go up lichened slab or traverse right to the edge of the crag. We went right. One could stop here ~110' up or continue leftward gaining a nicely featured face with knobs somewhat reminiscent of the golden knob pitch on the Grand Teton's Upper Exum Ridge. ~230' up is a good flake below a stump.\n\nP2. Angle right to the edge and into the sun. Continue up the edge on slightly gritty rock to a ledge ~220' up.\n\nP3. Continue up the edge, pass an ET-reminiscent horn. The terrain soon flattens out passing a couple 4th Class descent options. However, you may continue upward to tag the top of the crag ~260' up. If you go this way, the descent is a walkoff.","protection":"A light rack to a #3.5 Camalot, wires, and a few hexes work.  We used a 70m rope, but that is not essential.","location":"This starts on the right side of the crag just right of a pine needle filled groove on a slab."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,15650526-a829-53c5-8c09-df78c17ed405,910f7655-7995-57e3-997a-ccd5d226f33b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","Fall River Road (US 34 West)","Rainbow Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.59258,40.38911]},"bbox":[-105.59317036749779,40.38866033981814,-105.5919896325022,40.38955966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109611171","area_id":"kQ92VXmVV+OZeszV0ibzOw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:00.783Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:50.859Z"}
