The line ascends a dihedral that becomes a flake, and then goes on up the face to a 2-bolt belay/rap station.\n\nP2: climb up and to the right, into the large dihedral, where it is possible to traverse right on to a vertical face with large footholds.  There are 2 bolts visible on this face (see photo). After traversing the face, gain the arete proper, which is easy but very exposed climbing.
