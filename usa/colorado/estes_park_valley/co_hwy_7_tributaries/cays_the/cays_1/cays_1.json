You may be able to fiddle in a cam between bolt 1 and 2 to avoid groundfall potential.  The anchor consists of 2 bolts, one with an open cold shut and a second with a homemade hanger (which has since been replaced) that makes it suboptimal for rappel.","location":"This is the bolted line just to the left of the groove."},"__v":0},{"_id":"2OR6i3RvWxW1lgkL4y5Bsg==","name":"Unknown A","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Pomtier and A.

It hops over 2 bulges.\n\nGet situated onto the slab below a bolt with a homemade hanger with a delicate move (perhaps the crux).  You can get a yellow TCU/Alien to protect the pull over the first overlap.  Move up to the second overlap and fiddle in a big nut or small hex.  Reach over and clip the 3rd bolt.  From here, you can pull a balancy left hand layback with a left foot smear (done this way, this is the crux) or move left on easier terrain.  A devilishly tall climber might just latch onto that tempting jug up and right of the 3rd bolt, but the average height climber's desire will be unfulfilled without a dyno.  Continue up to a pair of bolts, one of which has a chain and the other is a odd homemade hanger.\n\nWalkoff right and down a ramp or around the back.","protection":"3 bolts, yellow TCU/Alien, big wire or small hex.","location":"This line fires up over 2 overlaps.
