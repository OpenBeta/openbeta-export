It has probably been done before perhaps by a different name.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the Three Graces route in Garden of the Gods but not as high in quality.  Nonetheless, it may be worth a romp for the adventuresome.\n\nThe start of the climb is close to Your Possible Pasts, near a tree.  The crux moves are close to the ground.  You can loop a horn with a sling.  Near the crest, you can use a longer than 48\" sling to get some probably psychological pro.  Continue past a break (#3 Camalot) to the far end of the rib.\n\n0.76 stars, rounds to 1 ;)","protection":"Light rack to #3 Camalot, 2 longs slings (48\" plus).","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"rGqpsUfDXcqvRtr7nXzCFg==","name":"Jabba","yds":"5.4","grades":{"yds":"5.4","french":"4a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.5408,40.3126]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"105762579","mp_crag_id":"105820587","climb_id":"rGqpsUfDXcqvRtr7nXzCFg==","areaRef":"jWEIf81tUKO1/HtvXP+C8g=="},"content":{"description":"Find this meandering line on The Blade's east face and northern arête.  From the summits of Long Wall & Little Blade, your eye may be drawn to a faint resemblance to a Star Wars character on the E face of this squat fin of rock.  It certainly may have been done previously.  Rock quality is better than Little Blade.  The angle of the rock is lower than you might suspect from a distance.  It may be worth a romp for the adventuresome.\n\nCertainly there may be multiple starts to gain the N arête.  The path of least resistance is between live & dead trees near the arête.  Face climb up, place a cam in the horizontal and fire up to the arête.  Continue up easy terrain, top out on the summit block, down climb to the S end of The Blade, belay.\n\n0.67 stars, rounds to 1 ;)","protection":"Light rack with a black Alien to #2 Camalot, longs slings.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,999af1f6-9a89-5316-b680-01294e8764bb,7b2cbe55-b4e8-5119-a9bf-5dfee2f4bac4,8d61087f-cd6d-50a3-b5fc-7b6f5cff82f2","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","CO Hwy 7 & Tributaries","Jurassic Park - Lily Lake","Blade & neighboring rib, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"},{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.5408,40.3126]},"bbox":[-105.54138969810575,40.312150339818146,-105.54021030189428,40.313049660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105820587","area_id":"jWEIf81tUKO1/HtvXP+C8g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.54138969810575,40.312150339818146],[-105.54021030189428,40.312150339818146],[-105.54021030189428,40.313049660181875],[-105.54138969810575,40.313049660181875],[-105.54138969810575,40.312150339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:00.276Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:12.703Z"}
