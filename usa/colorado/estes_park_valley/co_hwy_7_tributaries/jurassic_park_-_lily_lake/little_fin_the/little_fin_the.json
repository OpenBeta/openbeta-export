Then there is a longish reach around the 4th bolt. Dance right (cruxish), up, then left. Note,\n\nthe 6th bolt leaves your top biner dangling partway over an edge\n\n, so I don't recommend falling on the 6th bolt. Perhaps a rounded hanger would allow threading a sling? The terrain eases up, and you gain the two bolt anchor.\n\nThis route currently leaves one a bit cautious pulling on flakes and trusting edges. This is adventure sport climbing.\n\nNote, Claude indicated he felt the route clocks in at 8+. Per Claude, \"it was named after a small extinct creature that managed to survive for a time during and after the era of the thunder lizards. There's even a picture of what it was thought to look like on Wikipedia.\" Thanks, Claude!\n\nPer\n\nBruce Hildenbrand\n\n: because of the distance between the 4th and 5th bolts, if the leader falls or blows the clip at the 5th bolt, they are looking at a 25+' fall onto a big ledge.

Find the pine tree at the bottom of the north face of the Little Fin and scramble up the rocky ledges located to the right of the tree.\n\nStart the route by working from right to left on the diagonal ledge that heads up towards the first bolt (which is about 20 feet off the deck). Follow the well-placed and nicely spaced bolts slightly leftwards and upwards through a slight bulge and steep section. The angle of the climb backs off as you ascend.\n\nThere are many nice flakes and positive ledgy holds on the way up.  Beware holds popping off or breaking; however, as this is a new route and some of the rock (especially in the lower section) feels/sounds hollow. The route should clean up nicely as it sees more traffic. This is a very good climb for the moderate leader.\n\nWhen being lowered or rappelling down from the anchors, work right to avoid winding up in the pine tree below the route. Medium to large cams can be used to build an anchor system for the belayer on the ledge system west of the pine tree.","protection":"7 bolts and two twist link anchors at top.","location":"This is downhill from the Fin and directly across from Left Hand Rock (and\n\nTriceratops\n\nand\n\nT-Rect\n\n)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,999af1f6-9a89-5316-b680-01294e8764bb,7b2cbe55-b4e8-5119-a9bf-5dfee2f4bac4,2dac461c-b053-5841-b3a5-83e5170dfa76","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","CO Hwy 7 & Tributaries","Jurassic Park - Lily Lake","Little Fin, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8-"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.54181,40.31175]},"bbox":[-105.54239969068345,40.31130033981814,-105.54122030931657,40.31219966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106255774","area_id":"LaxGHLBTWEGzpYPlFw36dg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.54239969068345,40.31130033981814],[-105.54122030931657,40.31130033981814],[-105.54122030931657,40.31219966018187],[-105.54239969068345,40.31219966018187],[-105.54239969068345,40.31130033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:00.276Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:43.497Z"}
