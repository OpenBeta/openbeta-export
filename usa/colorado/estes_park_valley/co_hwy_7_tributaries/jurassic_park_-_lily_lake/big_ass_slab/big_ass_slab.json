It can be started with a ledge just off the ground before the first bolt, from here climb to 2 bolts and then traverse to the right approx. 6 feet and follow the bolt line to the top of the cliff. The crux comes at the traverse, and climbing straight up through the 2/3/4 bolt could be a little harder than 5.9+ as the feet are very slippery and precise. This is a good route but not worth 3 stars comparing it to the route just right and left of it. A great warmup route to do some of the more harder routes at Jurassic Park. Clean rock and a decent line, minus the little traverse.","protection":"7 bolts + 2 bolt anchor.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"ov2KvSG/XaeDcwBfpW9c5A==","name":"Critical Morass","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Rick Thompson, Sam Davidson & Pat Thompson","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.54213,40.312]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105762273","mp_crag_id":"105820645","climb_id":"ov2KvSG/XaeDcwBfpW9c5A==","areaRef":"KInViHUQW8iBfp7MB6/ZXg=="},"content":{"description":"This route follow a beautifully clean line up a blank looking slab and then cruises through a little bulge before reaching the anchors. It is a spectacular line that rates as one of my favorite slab climbs to date in Colorado. Locate this route by finding the 4 bolts on a blank looking, steep wall just uphill from the previous bolted lines (3rd bolted line from the left, facing the cliff).\n\nClimb the delicate slab with tricky feet to the 3rd bolt and reach the 2 nice pockets before the crux, paste your feet high and reach for crimps on the slab above, very nice moves on superb rock. A funky move before getting over the bulge will keep you thinking on this route. This is splendid climbing, a must do at Jurassic Park.

It is past a bolted climb called Gilded Lilly.  This is a long, bolted, low-angled arete/rib that tracks up easy terrain and has great exposure above the lake and a beautiful view of the Diamond off to the south. A spectacular photo can be taken of the Diamond in the background from higher up (approx. 50') on the trail. This is an excellent route on great stone with fun, slabby climbing. Bring a 60m rope as a 50 may not reach the ground, you could scramble off to the left if you were desperate though.
