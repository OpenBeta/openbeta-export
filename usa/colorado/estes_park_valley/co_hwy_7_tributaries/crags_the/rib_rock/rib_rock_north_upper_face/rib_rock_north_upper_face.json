The slightly overhanging hand crack just right of the chimney system is your goal.\n\nP1. Scramble up poorly protected (no gear) rock for 20 feet to engage the hand crack. Follow this through a few bulges to a stance below the squeeze on P2.\n\nP2. Luckily there are two options for pitch 2. There is a squeeze chimney on the left (5.8) and a left-facing dihedral (5.9) on the right. The pitch ends on the summit ridge. The 5.9 pitch protects well with thin hand pieces, while the squeeze would require 6-8 inch gear.\n\nThere are great views of the north face of Sharksfin with the Diamond in the background on the summit ridge.

A light rack of cams is optional for the crux and recommended for the 5.10 variation.\n\nThe 5.11 crux is at the third bolt, which has ledge fall potential if you blow it.  A tiny TCU is helpful to reduce that chance.  A 5.10 bypass can be done to the right, which is protected by small cams.  A few long slings are also helpful to reduce drag.\n\nYou can lower with a 70m to the ground, and just barely rap with a 60m.
