It feels to me like a 5.8 you would find in a climbing gym. The bolts were placed to accommodate a 5'0\" climber.\n\nA 70m rope is mandatory for lowering off.\n\nIf you packed a picnic or a bottle of wine, the leader may want to keep climbing past the anchors to the top of Rib Rock and belay the second up off a tree, resulting in a wonderful summit view. If you do this, you'll need to hike down by heading east (climber's right) for a bit and then south back into the boulder field between Rib and Sharksfin.\n\nBring your helmets.

The best approach is to take the new (2018?) approach trail to the Alcove (Half and Half / Woodstone). Keep heading north through the Alcove and then up the talus between Rib Rock and Sharksfin.
