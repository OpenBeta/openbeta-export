Climb up three bolts of easy climbing to a no hand stance and pedestal below the pillar. The first couple bolts from here are pretty straightforward crimping up a seam, and then a couple small edges take you to a left hand sloper ball at the third bolt. The crux is the next couple moves up and right to a little spike and beyond. This is absolutely worth it for the incredible position and excellent rock on this unique feature.","protection":"7 bolts to a one bolt anchor (no chains) over the lip. Make sure to bring a longer draw or sling to lower from that one bolt (you can back it up with the pin and nut that are fixed up there too), and then I would recommend climbing '\n\nPoint of Honor\n\n,' 5.5, on the other side to clean your final draw (it's an easy solo).
