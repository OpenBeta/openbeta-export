S. Kimball's 1986 'Estes Park Rock Climbs' guidebook notes that a 'ribald title...was suggested by an anonymous climber who penned his thought into the Sharksfin summit register' as Enos Mills Last Erection.  R. Rossiter's Estes Valley guidebook noted a generic name of North Crack, while B. Gillett's Crags guidebook notes the submitted title.  For lack of desire to cross-reference this website with perhaps seedier sites, I have chosen the last.\n\nThis fun, 30-40 ft climb is short but probably worth the effort only if you are near it in the Crags.  It lies on a short spire just S of Sharkfin, just uphill from Half & Half, just W of Gray Slab, N of Crosswinds, & downhill/NW of Upper Great Face.  The obvious widening crack is N- or NE-facing.  It is pictured on the far R side of a photo on p. 133 of S. Kimball's guidebook.  There is a more challenging-appearing fissure on the S face of this pinnacle.\n\nYou can start from the talus below to lengthen the climb a bit or from an obvious ledge system.  Place the 0.5 & 0.75 Camalot-sized pieces, make a long reach, and worm your feet past a bulge.  Place your widest cam before you engage the offwidth to chimney flare.  Just to the R of the crack is a questionable pin.  Wiggle & heel-toe into the fissure or sportclimb the faceholds on the outside and soon enough you are at the top.  A loop of sling hanging down from the rappel anchor can give you a final bit of protection.  Longish (48 in) slings are useful on the summit for girth-hitching the base of a couple boulders for an anchor on top.\n\nThere are a number of slings around a large boulder lying on top with a link to rappel off the summit.  Or you can downclimb.\n\n1.45 stars IMHO.","protection":"A handful of cams or hexes, plus a pin.  A large bigbro may be useful for the timid.  Longs slings for the anchor (0.5, 0.75, 4 Camalots useful).","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,cd674f3c-8205-5aea-b926-ef2c3b804ed5,999af1f6-9a89-5316-b680-01294e8764bb,1187980b-e873-5b6e-b8c2-d7ac0e0107eb,c113ad5b-e7f3-5801-99e7-bb5da43354bd","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Estes Park Valley","CO Hwy 7 & Tributaries","Crags, The","Enos Mills"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.5233,40.3063]},"bbox":[-105.52388964310103,40.30585033981814,-105.52271035689901,40.306749660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746638","area_id":"wROtW+fzWAGZ57tdpDNUvQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:00.271Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:50.132Z"}
