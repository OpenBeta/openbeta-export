Your feet start spread as well. Your left hand has to spread out wide to the sidepull, then your feet match, and then your left foot goes out to a slanted ledge. Your right hand goes up to a slopey crimp, and then a dyno to a crimpy ledge allows the climber to top out the route. The crux is the dyno for most, although there is a static way to complete the boulder - with an extra crimp. In general, this route is well-protected, but the spotters have to help during the topout.","protection":"Crashpads are recommended.","location":"The route is found on the main face of the overhang on the backside of the main Friendship Boulder.
