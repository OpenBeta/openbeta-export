It is better to start about 3 moves in, where there are better holds, and it's less contrived. The lower start makes it maybe a grade harder.\n\nIt is so named because my son had just been born, AKA, 'Dragon enters the world.'","protection":"It has undulating rock and a gravel landing, but it isn't high. Bring 2 pads and a spotter to be safe.","location":"Hike up the main abandoned road trail, loop right, loop left, and back. On your right in a few minutes, you will see some 10-12 foot tall boulders, which contain Elkfont, a nice tech-bulge. Hike further down the trail about as far as you have come, and you will see another cluster on your right. That contains\n\nAfrika Baambaata\n\nand Bridge of Ashes. Hike to that.\n\nHike to the right, past Bridge of Ashes, over some rock slabs for not more than a couple minutes.

I read somewhere that Dave thought this was V11 when he did it and was surprised to find that others thought it was harder. Truth be told, it's not commonly done and is pretty stiff even for V12. Talk about playing to Dave's strengths....\n\nStart sitting with a right heel hook around the corner.","protection":"The crux is low, and that takes 2-3 pads, but it finishes tall on less-than-ideal rock (so you want a pad for the finish as well).","location":"Hike up the abandoned dirt road for 5-10 minutes, and look for a big cluster on your right.
