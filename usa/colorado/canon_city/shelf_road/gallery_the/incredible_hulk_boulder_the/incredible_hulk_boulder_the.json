To avoid a duplicate post, the second post is added on here.\n\nThis short, steep, pocket-pulling, boulder problem on a rope - not your usual Shelf affair - is on the Incredible Hulk Boulder.  To get there, either hike to the far side and aim down or follow the approach path from the right side of Bulge wall at the Gallery, look for a faint path to the right (the main trail heads up to the far side and you will have to scramble down again).  This is the right line of three on the SE side of the boulder, just right of the 13.  Sweet long pulls and quick problem solving end just as quickly.  You may give this three stars if you like this style - I prefer it to last longer. Given 11d by Van Horn's guide and 12a/b in Knapp's -fun line no matter the grade.\n\nPer\n\nLeeAB Brinckerhoff\n\n: this is really fun pocket climbing on the steep face. All the holds are good by Shelf standards, but the wall is way steeper. I lead this route several times and bouldered it a couple. I have a friend who at the time had not climbed 5.12- but could boulder up to V6 who was working it as a boulder problem, so while the fall is big from the top, it is not terrible.\n\n4 Stars\n\nis for bouldering it, 3 stars for leading. As a boulder problem, it is tall and proud, even if you do it on a rope first (obviously even prouder if not checked out on a rope), but as a lead it's just too short for 4 stars.","protection":"3 bolts to 2 bolt anchor shared with\n\nSuper Phrique\n\nor (per\n\nLeeAB Brinckerhoff\n\n) pads.","location":"Per\n\nLeeAB Brinckerhoff\n\n: the right hand line on the down canyon face of the boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ShC+cFodWReC9crEVqR3yQ==","name":"David Banner","yds":"5.12c","grades":{"yds":"5.12c","french":"7b+"},"fa":"Rich Purnell","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2367,38.6192]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106135325","mp_crag_id":"106129776","climb_id":"ShC+cFodWReC9crEVqR3yQ==","areaRef":"LMxcSUIQVCyyNPZ0iHeTQQ=="},"content":{"description":"Climb pockets to a hard crux.","protection":"4 bolts to a 1 bolt anchor.","location":"This route is located on the North face of the Incredible Hulk Boulder just as you walk up to it."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,47053277-7738-5e02-b3b0-a0fc26a64b07,198facc2-f25b-5ee9-a386-df4e3c4c5ee2,7fedd351-f858-5984-93fc-c49188abbb7e,2ccc5c49-4210-542c-b234-f67488779341","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Canon City","Shelf Road","Gallery, The","Incredible Hulk Boulder, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":1}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2367,38.6192]},"bbox":[-105.23727551982768,38.61875033981814,-105.2361244801723,38.61964966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106129776","area_id":"LMxcSUIQVCyyNPZ0iHeTQQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.23727551982768,38.61875033981814],[-105.2361244801723,38.61875033981814],[-105.2361244801723,38.61964966018187],[-105.23727551982768,38.61964966018187],[-105.23727551982768,38.61875033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:04.131Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:59.971Z"}
