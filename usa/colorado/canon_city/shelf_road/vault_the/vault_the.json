While pulling through the bulge is probably the crux, this route just seemed to ratchet up in difficulty the higher one climbed. Expect more edges and side-pulls than pockets. Jewel is just that, and comes with excellent stone, tricky sequences, and powerful climbing. I'll stick with two stars since it is usually listed that way in the guides, however, for the variety of moves, continuity, and great stone, it ticks in as one of my favorites in The Vault (three stars in my notes). Jewel is also lots less fingery than The Gem.
