Actually it is probably not that bad, in fact, if you ignore the fire in your tips as you grab the serrated edges, the moves are pretty fun.\n\nThis is located just past 1/2 way along Contest (left) Wall in Sand Gulch about 4 lines past\n\nLime and Punishment\n\n(11b/c), 5 past\n\nRegroovable\n\n(11b). It ascends the first line on left of a corner. This is a slabby route for Shelf on grey/white rock. There is a small bush to right of the 7th bolt. It really does have nice moves, it is just really sharp.","protection":"8 bolts to 2 bolt anchor.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,47053277-7738-5e02-b3b0-a0fc26a64b07,198facc2-f25b-5ee9-a386-df4e3c4c5ee2,6d73c2b1-356e-55d5-a340-e4ea1cf19193,d1dc3750-521c-5c65-8d94-927975d75567","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Canon City","Shelf Road","Sand Gulch","Contest Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":6,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":3,"label":"5.11c/d"},{"count":5,"label":"5.11a/b"},{"count":6,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":6,"label":"5.9"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11b/c"},{"count":9,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":6,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10b/c"},{"count":3,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":11,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":4,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":3,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":7,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"V0-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":4,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":3,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":85,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":30,"advanced":53,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":33,"advanced":54,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.23217,38.62148]},"bbox":[-105.23274553812368,38.62103033981814,-105.2315944618763,38.621929660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105744998","area_id":"0dw3UFIcXGWNlJJ5dddVZw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":90,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:04.130Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:53.066Z","_change":{"user":"bWXI1tTmRgqw2ihF4jpUzw==","historyId":"642b691d31d93a51e2eff0ea","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0}}
