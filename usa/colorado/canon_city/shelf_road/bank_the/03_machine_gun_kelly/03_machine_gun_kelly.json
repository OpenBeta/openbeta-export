It is route number 2 on [William Prehm's Neopolitan Headrush] area photo.\n\nBegin face climbing up the [Mushroom Dome] on good pockets, past 2 bolts and a slightly difficult move or two.  The route then traverses a bit left to a small steep corner.  Crank like a banshee through this section and 3 bolts into a weird off balance blocky section.  The next bolt is way up to the left under the roof.  This section of climbing isn't mega tough, but it isn't easy and you will probably be carrying a substantial pump.  I would possibly give this section an 'R' rating, because if you come off you will probably eat the big ledge below you.  Make sure your belayer is ready to head for [Canon City] (meaning running belay to the south) if you do come off.  Once you get the  bolt under the roof clipped you can shake your pump out and deal with the stout boulder problem finish.  Crank pretty freakin' hard over the roof and keep looking up and to the left.  The anchors are difficult to see, but sometimes they have webbing on them.
