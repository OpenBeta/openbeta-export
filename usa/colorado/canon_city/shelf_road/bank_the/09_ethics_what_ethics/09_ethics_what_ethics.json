The climb starts by surmounting a medium-sized block to gain a no hand stance to clip the first bolt, and then pleasant climbing up water sculpted grey holds via fun sequences that would be good for a five five leader.  While this route is not world class, it does add an easy climb to a great area and would be a good first lead for the aspiring climber.","protection":"6 bolts to a coldshut anchor.","location":"It is located on a southwest-facing slab 10 feet left of \"\n\nTribal Boundary\n\n\" (about 40 feet left of the 2150 Wall.
