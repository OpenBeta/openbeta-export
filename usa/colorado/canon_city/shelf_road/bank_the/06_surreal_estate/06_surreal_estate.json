Very continuous climbing on pockets and edges takes you up to a horrizontal break. A traverse left gets you to a spot below the crack. Moderate climbing with some unexpected exposure (for the Shelf) gets you up the crack.  I ususally find that if anything is cruxy on this route, it comes in the first 40 or 50 feet when the climbing picks up thin pockets and a few thin, flat inclusions. No single move is really 11c, so it may gain a notch or two for continuity to hit 11c. Don't be put off by the opening moves, big reaches for reasonable finger pockets will get you to a good jug pocket just below clip two, however, the opening feet are really marginal. For my style, I find that the best part of the climb lies in the first half dozen bolts. I wish that this excellent line were closer to home since Unusual Weather is well worth doing if you are in the neighborhood.","protection":"Nine to ten draws and a rope.\n\nPer\n\nBob-a\n\n: The route was climbed with just three bolts and some tricams in pockets on the FA.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"FQUkurkSWcWCZPAu8oTTsQ==","name":"Trundle","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Brian Shelton and Stewart Green","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.23047,38.63364]},"left_right_index":122,"mp_id":"107106829","mp_crag_id":"121818343","climb_id":"FQUkurkSWcWCZPAu8oTTsQ==","areaRef":"KLm4ccvNUhes5xAgbDgovA=="},"content":{"description":"Scramble up a pile of blocks and make a committing move to clip the first bolt.
