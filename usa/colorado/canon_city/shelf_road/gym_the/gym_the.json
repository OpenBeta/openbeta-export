Arnold! takes the left of these two lines, and the name fits until the crimps are reached.  Steep jug pulling is friendly for the first two bolts, but just as the angle begins to ease the full-hand buckets disappear in favor of crimps and sharp bidoigt pockets.  The ever-decreasing angle of the bulge motivates one to hustle, and if you outrace the pump you will find your feet beneath you for a few easy slab moves to the chains.\n\nFor those of us who climb like Austrian bodybuilders, this is a nice jughaul detour from the punishment of all those vertical Shelf faces.","protection":"Five bolts protect the steep pulling very well.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"v5D//NZAVaaRkVYIIjxbTw==","name":"The Armstrong Express","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2165,38.6329]},"left_right_index":77,"mp_id":"106676118","mp_crag_id":"105745346","climb_id":"v5D//NZAVaaRkVYIIjxbTw==","areaRef":"c4uebuorVi2/3CsuRPPClg=="},"content":{"description":"This line offers some excellent marble stone and some fun sinker jug pockets.
