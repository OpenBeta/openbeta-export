A big reach on thin hands delivers a second crux, that is not without it's own spook factor.

Two easy clips lead into the middle of this ultra-technical friction route. Don't be fooled; just because most routes here are largely straightforward, Positions really is 5.12, and really is tricky. I tried to fire straight through the friction and flailed miserably. Whether or not it was intended, the right edge of the face kicks up just enough purchase for one hand to pull through the friction sequence, but it is still 5.12 climbing. What saves it from being really difficult, is the presence of a good horizontal system above the fifth clip, and this minimizes the amount of sketchy foot work. This is not powerful climbing, however, it is technical and very dependent on obtaining good frictional footwork.
