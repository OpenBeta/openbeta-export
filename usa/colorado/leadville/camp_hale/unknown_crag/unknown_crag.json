It looks like you could make this a 5.11 by staying directly under the bolts and pulling some hard pinches, a small pocket, and laybacks. We went left starting more on the left bolted route but clipping this route.\n\nThe crux is getting over the lip from the 2nd bolt to the third. Just above the 2nd bolt are a few crimpy, slightly sloper holds, but it still positive enough to move on. Start in a huge pocket to the left of the 2nd bolt, lean out far to the right (this might be harder for shorter reaches), and lean into a small ledge above the 2nd bolt. Cross over to another good ledge, and adjust your feet to then pop up and over the ledge to a huge chunk of rock.\n\nOnce up and above the 2nd bolt, stay right for a rather easy climb or stay more out on the arete for a more challenging climb.","protection":"There are anchors at the top.","location":"This is the right most bolted route in the back of the crag.
