Climb up the slab to the first bolt, make a long, awkward move to the flake on the left and then follow bolts up to the crack. Follow the nice splitter (might be some vegetation in spots, as it doesn't see much traffic) as it widens from fingers to fists. Best to move up past the first anchor to the next anchor 20' higher.\n\nP2. Follow the bolts up the edge of the face. The exposure in spots is excellent, as the formation drops steeply into the gully on your right. Stop at the obviously belay anchor, or link with the next pitch for a 200' monster.\n\nP3. Follow more bolts up as the rock gets steeper, working whichever side appeals to you. Really nice climbing.\n\nDescent:\n\nMake 2 single rope raps back to the higher belay anchor at the top of the first pitch. From here, a 70m cord will get you to the bottom if you head down in the right spot, otherwise move to the lower anchor. With a 60m, you SHOULD be able to reach the ground from the lower anchor, but may have to rap into the gully on climber's right instead, make sure to pay attention while you rap.","protection":"Take 12 quickdraws and a single set of cams from fingers to fists, if you want to sew up the crack.","location":"Follow the trail/talus up to the obvious large slab, the route starts on the right side of the formation, the first bolt should be obvious, just down and right of a large, pointy flake."},"__v":0},{"_id":"waEsPqelUKS571iThWja/A==","name":"Straight Through The Gates of Hell","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Bryan Gall, Donnie Grange, Kenny Belinski","type":{"trad":true,"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.56189,39.28957]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"107665383","mp_crag_id":"105746489","climb_id":"waEsPqelUKS571iThWja/A==","areaRef":"ytlCpp6nX4GFIXrISdMSxw=="},"content":{"description":"Pitch 1: 5.9.
