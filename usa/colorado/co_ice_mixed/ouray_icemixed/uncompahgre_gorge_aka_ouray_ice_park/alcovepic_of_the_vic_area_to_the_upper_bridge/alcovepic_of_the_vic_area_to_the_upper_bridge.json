Start uphill from\n\nVerminator\n\nand downstream from\n\nDream Team\n\n. It is a pleasure and a pump.\n\nDetails: shred the Krispy Gnar on this testpiece. Stick picks up & over first two bulges (good rock pro). Power up a finger/hand crack. Climb an overhang to gain a WI6 hanging curtain. Pull the lip, and ascend WI3 ice to top. This is an all trad ice climb.\n\nIt is 30m. Climb thin ice to a rock crack. There is an interesting hammer jam midway. Delicate rock and thin ice moves keep your attention. A key right hand jam in overhanging rock bit connects 2 very positive left hooks. Finish with moderate ice above. This is great fun.","protection":"Nuts & cams to 4 inches, with emphasis on fingers to hands, screws, longs slings for big trees at top.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,1fa8fb4e-3301-5cfc-94e0-0401fe922f56,d71642e5-9bcd-5b7b-ab37-f9d7a21da88a,f67a6a40-c188-5ee4-b850-0700f079fb0d,c8827698-98ae-53b9-b514-7d30234cdd9b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","CO Ice & Mixed","Ouray (Ice/Mixed)","Uncompahgre Gorge aka Ouray Ice Park","Alcove/Pic of the Vic area to the Upper Bridge"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.67309,38.01556]},"bbox":[-107.67366074808163,38.015110339818136,-107.67251925191839,38.01600966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105917294","area_id":"yIJ2mJiuU7m1FH0wI0zdmw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.67366074808163,38.015110339818136],[-107.67251925191839,38.015110339818136],[-107.67251925191839,38.01600966018186],[-107.67366074808163,38.01600966018186],[-107.67366074808163,38.015110339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:06.855Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:54.229Z"}
