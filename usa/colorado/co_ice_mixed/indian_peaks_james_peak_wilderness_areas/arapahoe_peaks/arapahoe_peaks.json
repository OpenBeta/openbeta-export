It has seen numerous ski descents; however, it makes for a great climb later in the season as well.\n\nIn early season, expect snow up to 55 degrees. In later season, you might encounter AI2 with bits of scrambling.\n\nThere are a couple start options. Skiers generally take the prominent apron/gully further northwest, and climbers might opt for a narrower left-angling finger further right/southeast which intersects the overall right-trending line and hitting the South/North Arapaho Traverse about 700 feet northwest of South Arapaho in the class 2 section. The general couloir meanders up the prominent west-southwest gully with a few short traverses potentially required.\n\nGo left for the Class 3 traverse to North, or go right at Class 2 to hit South and the trail.","protection":"Light alpine, if warranted","location":"This is a line on the southwest face of South Arapaho Peak. It is the most prominent, though meandering, line/gully northwest of Skywalker. The base is approximately 300-350 yards northwest/up valley from the base of Skywalker.\n\nApproach as for Skywalker from 4th of July Trailhead or stick closer to the main drainage. Approximately 1.5-2.5 hours from the trailhead (closed in winter/early spring)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,1fa8fb4e-3301-5cfc-94e0-0401fe922f56,e5ebe16b-6f8b-5e75-b821-41a5a1c71cad,031f2c3b-4222-5a08-a36f-33ddb9408dd4","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","CO Ice & Mixed","Indian Peaks & James Peak Wilderness Areas","Arapahoe Peaks"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.64384,40.02382]},"bbox":[-105.64442719456983,40.023370339818136,-105.64325280543018,40.02426966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109978563","area_id":"Ax8sO0IiWgijbzPduUCN1A=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:07.424Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:21.952Z"}
