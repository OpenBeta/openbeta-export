This route offers a really fun, though short pitch of ice, followed by a very airy, mixed traverse with good gear. The cruxes are a good deal harder than\n\nTotal Abandon\n\nand\n\nBlind Assumption\n\n, and the approach is no gimme, but, if you're up for a new adventure, go check 'er out.\n\nP1. Rope up for a short approach pitch around a chockstone. Belay on left at a fixed pin about 20 feet shy of the ice, 40 feet.\n\nP2. Climb steep ice through the chimney, then step left on a hanging curtain (ice crux). Belay at the end of the ice by slinging the big chockstone, 60 feet.\n\nP3. Traverse left across big blocks with bad feet then straight up through a v-slot roof (mixed crux). Belay just above at a pin, or continue higher to a better ledge but minimal gear.\n\nP4/5. Aim left up the ramp, and pick your poison, 5.5-5.8.","protection":"Single rack, 5 or 6 screws, 10 shoulder lengths. I left a couple pins along the way.","location":"Drive past the hero traverse parking spot and park about one mile down from the summit on a sharp turn. This will be the first switchback past the parking for\n\nTotal Abandon\n\nand\n\nBlind Assumption\n\n.\n\nCross the highway, and walk down the cog railroad for about 0.5 miles (ish) until you see an obvious saddle on your left. Leave the tracks and cross the saddle, hugging the left side. You will pop over into a steep couloir, marked by a large cave at the top. Follow this most of the way down before cutting left across the spur. Aim for being about 50 feet below the obvious, yellow wall in the middle of the spur. Follow the contour around and keep looking up, the route is in the middle of the big wall above you.\n\nPM if you need clearer directions."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,1fa8fb4e-3301-5cfc-94e0-0401fe922f56,cc05ca35-fdfb-5c57-a4d6-02e1aceb6e1c,2749969b-251f-5112-95d2-2e7dee07735c,69f24aed-a3fd-58b8-94ce-eab88ce47622","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","CO Ice & Mixed","Colorado Springs & vicinity","Pike's Peak","Southeast Face"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.044,38.8406]},"bbox":[-105.04457730618412,38.840150339818145,-105.04342269381587,38.841049660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106379955","area_id":"afJK7aP9WLiUzuq4jOR2Ig=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:08.317Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:02.849Z"}
