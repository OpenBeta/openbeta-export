The route can be approached in a variety of styles, so it's up to the climbing team to adapt to the current conditions and be ready to improvise.\n\nDuring the first ascent, the lower half of the route was classic alpine mixed climbing with ice and drytooling cruxes.  The upper half of the route, though not snow and ice free, was climbed as a rock route with bare hands and rock shoes.  Earlier in the spring, the upper pitches likely hold more ice and would make for great steep and sustained mixed climbing.\n\nClimb\n\nBrain Freeze\n\npast the crux of the Changing Gullies pitch. Where\n\nBrain Freeze\n\ncuts right, go up and left, then traverse snow ledges out into the middle of the\n\nSolar Wall\n\n.  Set a belay just below a left facing corner system (M4, 180 feet from the bottom of the Changing Gullies pitch)\n\nIf the weather is warm enough for rock shoes, climb straight up past a bulge/sloping mantel move (crux) and into the corner system.  Continue up the corner to a nice alcove belay. (5.9, 180 feet)  If approached as a mixed route, a variation to the right of the bulge will likely make for exciting and exposed M6 climbing to reach the corner system.\n\nContinue up the corner system then switch to the left sided of the inset.
