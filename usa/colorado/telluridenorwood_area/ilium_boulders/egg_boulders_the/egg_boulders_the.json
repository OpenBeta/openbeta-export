Start standing on the right side of the southeast face with a couple of head height edges. Traverse left, using only holds below the lip. The crux comes early with a difficult move to match a vertical seam and move left from it to a gigantic flake. After gaining the flake, the difficulty eases, but there are still a few tricky bits. Keep traversing until reaching the northeast corner of the boulder (basically, where the two boulders touch) and top it out. Don't use the other boulder on the top out!\n\nIt is a really fun problem that is a great way to start or end the day.","protection":"It is pretty low to the ground, so a pad isn't really needed (other than to clean your shoes - it keeps the rock from getting polished!).
