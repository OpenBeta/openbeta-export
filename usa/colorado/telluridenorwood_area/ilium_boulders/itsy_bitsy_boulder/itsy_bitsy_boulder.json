Pull off the ground and make a hard move right to either one of a pair of crimps. Move the feet around and make a hard deadpoint/jump for another sloping crimp below the lip with your left. For most people, this is the crux. However, you still have to figure out a way to latch the lip, which is harder than it initially seems.\n\nThis problem would be perfect if it was ten feet taller, but despite its relatively short stature, it still presents a great challenge and is a bit of an area testpiece.\n\nThough I've never seen anyone use them, it should be noted that the left arete (and holds left of it) are not considered part of the problem.","protection":"A pad or two will suffice.","location":"This is on the trailside face of the Itsy Bitsy Boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,d91c72a2-88f4-56ed-b35c-d265d2fb0139,b3f5201f-71c1-5be4-8a08-9a25046812e4,76c633fb-6c27-5607-9c81-d38a18762413","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Telluride/Norwood area","Ilium Boulders","Itsy Bitsy Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.8163,37.9392]},"bbox":[-107.81687015458488,37.93875033981814,-107.81572984541513,37.939649660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107767155","area_id":"dsYz+2wnVgecgdOKGHYkEw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:19.860Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:03.333Z"}
