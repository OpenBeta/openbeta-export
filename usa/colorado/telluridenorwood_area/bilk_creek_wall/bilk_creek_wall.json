The majority of it has great edges, sidepulls, jugs, and feet. It is difficult to give it a grade, but it is as hard (if not harder) as the routes to the top of this small cliff.\n\nThere are two bouldery panels of rock on the west (looker's left) end of the wall and a tricky start/finish from the crack on the far east end (looker's right). Some of the sections are harder / easier depending on which direction you are climbing.\n\nThe crux middle panel can go high / low. Both versions have a few tough moves.","protection":"A second pad is nice for the middle crux panel, especially if you do the higher version.","location":"Start at the dirty steps / jugs on the far left end, or the obvious crack on the far right end. If you do the traverse and back (lap), it's about 100 feet of climbing."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,d91c72a2-88f4-56ed-b35c-d265d2fb0139,09e6df73-6966-5d2b-8706-2dbfb1b1533d","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Telluride/Norwood area","Bilk Creek Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.88599,37.94543]},"bbox":[-107.88656020292244,37.94498033981814,-107.88541979707756,37.945879660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105969972","area_id":"Cebfc2lmXSuHBi2/sbFTPQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.88656020292244,37.94498033981814],[-107.88541979707756,37.94498033981814],[-107.88541979707756,37.945879660181866],[-107.88656020292244,37.945879660181866],[-107.88656020292244,37.94498033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:19.858Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:53.932Z"}
