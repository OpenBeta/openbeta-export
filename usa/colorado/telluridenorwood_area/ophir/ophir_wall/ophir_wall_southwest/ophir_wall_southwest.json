A casual long route with great views, it links up several different sections of high-quality rock. This is an easy way to get up high quickly with low commitment.\n\nSome pitches require a little steep, loose hiking in between them, and fixed lines guide the way to belay stations. Watch for loose rocks, especially on the hiking sections and when pulling rappel ropes.\n\nWith the exception of a few moves on P5, all pitches are in the 5.7 to 5.8 range. Well-bolted, slabby face climbing makes this route fast and cruisy. It's nice to have a few small pieces of gear in between bolts on a few pitches. Many of the pitches can be combined, but watch for rope drag.","protection":"All pitches are bolted, some small gear is nice to have. Bring 6 sport draws, 6 long draws & a few nuts and small cams to #0.5 Camalot and one 70-meter rope (a 60m rope will not reach).\n\nAll belay stations are bolted. Rap the route.","location":"Park at a pullout on the north side of the Ophir road, 250 yards after turning off CO Hwy. 145, before the main Ophir Wall parking farther up. Head east up into the woods on a faint trail to the cliffs. Look to the slabs on your left, and spot the first pitch's obvious bolts.\n\nGo up. Rap down."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,d91c72a2-88f4-56ed-b35c-d265d2fb0139,0965de5d-32d3-55f5-a658-36aa1339adfd,3516975f-9a62-5387-9b96-61b75c50e4f6,482f06be-2318-59ed-9f5c-cffa46516996","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Telluride/Norwood area","Ophir","Ophir Wall","Ophir Wall southwest"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.86826,37.86075]},"bbox":[-107.8688295471804,37.86030033981814,-107.8676904528196,37.86119966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112213418","area_id":"SC8GviMYWe2fXM/6RlFplg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.8688295471804,37.86030033981814],[-107.8676904528196,37.86030033981814],[-107.8676904528196,37.86119966018187],[-107.8688295471804,37.86119966018187],[-107.8688295471804,37.86030033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:19.865Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:54.279Z"}
