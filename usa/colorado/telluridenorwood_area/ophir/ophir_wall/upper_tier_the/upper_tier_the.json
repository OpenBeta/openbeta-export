There are several crux sections over the course of the route, and they all tend to involve technical moves on holds that face the wrong way. Just after the fifth bolt, angle left into an obvious, low angle scoop. From here, the climbing gets noticeably easier. You can either run it out a long way (probably around 25-30 feet) to the anchor or bring some cams to protect this section.\n\nThis is an overlooked route that offers thought provoking and engaging moves on rock that feels more textured and granitic than what is commonly found on the Ophir Wall.","protection":"There are 5 bolts, followed by a very long run out to the anchor.
