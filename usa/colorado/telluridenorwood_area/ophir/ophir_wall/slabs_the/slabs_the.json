Don't even bother if you don't feel very, very comfortable on 5.9+ runout climbing.

The good news is the climbing between these points is not hard at all.\n\nThe ultimate crux of the route is in balancing up a right-trending, right-facing, layback crack.  Excellent movement well-protected by 2 pins leads you to a good cam placement and the chains.\n\nWith a 70m rope, I could easily rap to the top of the pillar which (especially after leading this route) is an easy downclimb.

There are no large placements to speak of, so leave your big stuff at the base.  The largest of my few pieces was a #3 orange TCU (finger sized cam).  Bring up finger sized cams up to a 0.75 C4 maybe, and a set of nuts.  There are also 2 bolts low on the route that protect the low crux, and 2 pins high to protect the upper crux (the lower of these can be backed up by a small cam).\n\nThe more small stuff you can bring, the better.\n\nBe prepared to sweat! :)","location":"Start just left of a small pillar up an easy slab for about 20 feet where you will find two bolts on the wall (and a sling hanging off the 1st bolt - as of this summer).
