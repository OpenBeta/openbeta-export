With the exception of the short fifth pitch, this route is consistent quality rock and in a pristine, idyllic setting. It is shady until about 2 or 3pm in late summer, but the fourth pitch is shady all day.\n\nP1: Follow pockets and jugs up to a small ledge beneath a leaning corner. Bullet rock, a great warm-up. 7ish bolts; 5.10a/b, 80'.\n\nP2: Stem up to a delicate clip and make committing moves up and left (11a) past the bulge, and onto a 5.10 face, 8 bolts to a nice ledge.\n\nP1+P2 can be linked with a 60m and creates an excellent long pitch.\n\nP3: the steep crux pitch. The rock changes a bit here and climbs like limestone. Sustained 11/11+ climbing over a bulge and through sequential pockets lead to mediocre stem rests and a difficult roof. Get creative. Pull into a hanging corner and belay. This pitch is likely to seep early season, 9 bolts, 80'.\n\nP4: the money pitch! Traverse right out over the void, staying right of the bolt line, reaching insanely exposed arete climbing! Belay at the top of the arete at a nice stance, 10+, 95', 9 bolts.\n\nP3+P4 could be linked into a absolutely MEGA pitch, but bring plenty of long runners.\n\nP5: the cool down? This is a short 5.8 pitch, maybe not worth doing, since it doesn't top out, but it only leads to a choss band below the top of the wall, 4 bolts?\n\nP4+P5 are easily linked.\n\nRap the route with a single 60m, but tie knots!\n\nLinking\n\nOz\n\nand Wildfire together (especially linking pitches into 200' leads) is easily one of the best climbing days I've ever had. Highly recommended.","protection":"Bolts. I am pretty sure no pitch has more than 9 bolts, but I could be wrong. I think we linked P1+P2 with 16 draws.
