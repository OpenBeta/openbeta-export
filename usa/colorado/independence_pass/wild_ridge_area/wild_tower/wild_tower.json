Begin with 15 feet of steep crack climbing up a wide-ish black crack. Avoid the large flakes in the gully left, and continue up three bolts to a finger-size piece. Trend up and right through two steep crack bulges. Cautiously move up high at the first steep crack bulge due to fractured rock in crack. Exit onto a ledge system while avoiding loose rock. Set a gear anchor.","protection":"3 bolts plus plus a couple of 3s and a possible 4 at the start. A green/red C3 is nice at the finger crack after the bolts. Also it is nice to save a #3 BD for the final crack finish. Set a gear anchor.","location":"It is 20 feet to right of the 5.8 pitch on\n\nEl Diablo de Oro\n\n. This ascends a black crack with lichen and undercut feet. The plus rating is due to the steep start and physical nature of the climbing."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,1cfe9980-37c5-592d-9648-d6fc803c3824,05e26eab-6685-574e-b3bd-791d44a53322,aa2eed1e-00d4-5409-a6c9-a35ae9d693ee","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Independence Pass","Wild Ridge Area","Wild Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.67445,39.12992]},"bbox":[-106.67502967042695,39.129470339818134,-106.67387032957303,39.13036966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121177059","area_id":"qi7tHgDUVAmmyaNa6daT7g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.67502967042695,39.129470339818134],[-106.67387032957303,39.129470339818134],[-106.67387032957303,39.13036966018186],[-106.67502967042695,39.13036966018186],[-106.67502967042695,39.129470339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:48.908Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:57.551Z"}
