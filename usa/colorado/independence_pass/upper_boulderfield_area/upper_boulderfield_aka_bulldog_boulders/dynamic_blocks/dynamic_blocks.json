Begin below and to the right of the jug rail.  Start with your left hand on a good side pull/undercling and your right on the arete. Get your butt off the ground, and slap your right hand up. The crux for me was transitioning to the jug rail.  From there, you just paste your feet and throw for the top.  Any problem that ends in a dyno is pretty satisfying.","protection":"A single pad is fine, maybe two if you want something underneath you for the sit start.","location":"It is on the West side of the right-hand Dynamic Block."},"__v":0},{"_id":"wyqiJgXHWFGr42UTwgvioQ==","name":"3.
