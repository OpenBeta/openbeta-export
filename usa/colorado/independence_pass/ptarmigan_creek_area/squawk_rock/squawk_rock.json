The difficulty is fairly sustained with only one great rest stance. There are two ways to finish: left (recommended) or right. There is an alternate set of chains off to the right if you opt to battle through the man-eating fist crack.\n\nGoing left is probably the trickier way to finish, but it is also more likely to leave your skin intact, and it appears to be the the FA party's intended line, judging by the location of the last bolt and the beefy chains at the apex of the cliff.
