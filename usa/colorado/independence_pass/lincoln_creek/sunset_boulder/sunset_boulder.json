It starts with a campus move from the only two crimps  easily identified by chalk  in the middle of the steep face. Snag a jug with the left hand, and swing your feet up to the crimps. Stand up, and dyno again from a shallow, right-hand pocket to a good, left-hand sloper on the lip of the boulder. Grab a right-hand flake over the lip and mantel it out. See descent info under the boulder's description.","protection":"A spotter is probably more important than pads, since the mantel at the top threatens to deposit you on some logs and rocks unless someone pushes you out of the way.","location":"This problem is on the southern, uphill side of the boulder, to the right of a steep, angling crack that the guidebook identifies as a V4."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,1cfe9980-37c5-592d-9648-d6fc803c3824,fd141097-d196-5f6c-ace4-457e8de2afc0,95e4adcd-1fa1-5173-b258-172dd7b6d6eb","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Independence Pass","Lincoln Creek","Sunset Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.69374,39.11649]},"bbox":[-106.69431955992476,39.11604033981814,-106.69316044007526,39.11693966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108286543","area_id":"leStzR+hUXOyWBct17bW6w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.69431955992476,39.11604033981814],[-106.69316044007526,39.11604033981814],[-106.69316044007526,39.11693966018186],[-106.69431955992476,39.11693966018186],[-106.69431955992476,39.11604033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:49.993Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:59.264Z"}
