There are some reasonable handholds to start (see the attached image). Use the small sidepull on the wall to shift your weight to the right, and work your feet to the right using the obvious jugs. On the second face, get as far out to the right as possible to kick your right leg into the crack between the second and third face. Get your right hand to a reasonable hold right next to the crack. Match, then do some finicky smearing, and use one crimpy hold to get up to the top out on the upper right. This is really a very fun route using a bunch of different styles.","protection":"A pad is useful at the start (the first move is finicky).
