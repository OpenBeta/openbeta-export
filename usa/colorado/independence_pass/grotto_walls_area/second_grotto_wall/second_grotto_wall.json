Clip the second bolt from a good sidepull, then follow a line of perma-draws through angular jugs and fun body positions. At around 100 feet, the line of nicely spaced perma-draws make an abrupt stop where you encounter a spooky, runout traverse leading to the second headwall out right. Clip two more fixed draws at the base of the second headwall, then continue up using your own draws to the anchors. For full value, you can top out and make your best effort to look like rocky after climbing the Rocky Steps at the Philly Art museum.","protection":"10 or so draws, two for the start and rest for the upper headwall. Use a long runner on the bolt next to the large, triangular jug to prevent your rope getting caught. A 80 meter rope is required for lowering in one go.
