I request it get better sorted by someone who knows the area better. That said, this is a nice, albeit chossy, \"pillar\" (a loose use of the word) that gets great exposure. Make sure your belayer has a helmet, or is ready to dodge rocks!\n\nClimb through one semi-difficult move across into the dihedral, then continue up the face of the pillar on nice moves. It gets a bit dicey at a wide horizontal between bolts, where the choss seemed to concentrate.\n\nIt is a great climb, and with some more traffic it could clean up nicely.","protection":"[9-10] draws if I remember correctly....
