Walking down the talus wasn't so bad if you make the walk up the road to this larger boulder. There are sandy trails and mellow approach opposed to straight talus. You can also approach by crossing the guardrail, but it is a little longer walk (but definitely much safer choice)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"4x5A25k9VImnOowhiWoPQA==","name":"Husky","yds":"V5-6","grades":{"yds":"V5-6","font":"6C+","vscale":"V5-6"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.69887,39.11895]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"111933195","mp_crag_id":"111933112","climb_id":"4x5A25k9VImnOowhiWoPQA==","areaRef":"hsXZuodkW3+MByWynRuqDg=="},"content":{"description":"Husky takes on the obvious, steep bulge on the west face.
