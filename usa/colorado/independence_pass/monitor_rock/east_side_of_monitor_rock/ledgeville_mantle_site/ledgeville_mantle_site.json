It gets less shade, since it is away from the aspens that protect the mine, so it can be warmer here in the summer months. It is a slopey climb with mostly friction techniques required for the send. The crux is the towards the middle with an obvious, blank-ish spot with crappy feet. This is a nice addition to the east side.","protection":"There are 6 or 7 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor at the top. It could also be TR'ed from a large tree above and just to the left.","location":"This is currently the leftmost bolted route on the east face proper. It is about 100 years left (south) along the wall from the mine. There is a bolted 5.10+/5.11 about 20 feet to the right of this one heading up the obvious black streak.\n\nPer\n\nAaron Glasenapp\n\n: this is definitely not on the Clairabell Mine wall as was originally described (we searched the whole cliff left of the mine and did not find it). If the beta photo is to be believed, it is on the Upper Tier. see approach description for the area, and please add details about this route if you have them."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,1cfe9980-37c5-592d-9648-d6fc803c3824,8f49be95-122b-59ba-a8f8-674f77735d10,9f3fa2c6-7037-56f8-a3a2-8c5b4bd64869,fbcc793a-e564-5206-8b89-1df5ada68352","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Independence Pass","Monitor Rock","East Side of Monitor Rock","Ledgeville Mantle Site"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.44939,39.07362]},"bbox":[-106.44996920768439,39.073170339818134,-106.44881079231561,39.074069660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120982429","area_id":"+8x5OuVkUgaLiR31raaDUg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:49.996Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:55.703Z"}
