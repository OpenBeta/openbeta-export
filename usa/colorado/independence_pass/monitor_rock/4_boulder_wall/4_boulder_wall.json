This corner has certainly been climbed before. After about 50 feet, locate a bolt to your right, and begin moving right into an angled, right-facing corner. Once in the corner, climb up past another bolt then up to a couple stacked blocks. Move right once more, placing gear as needed. Climb into some brownish rock with bolts protecting you to the anchor. Two fun sections await, the first .11-, followed by a fun .10+ bit. An easy 20’ more takes you to a two-bolt anchor, 150’, 5.11-, mixed protection.\n\nPitch 3.\n\nMove left on easy terrain to a bolt, then move down a move and then upward following bolts to a cool flake feature and a bolt protected move into the start of a fun crack section. Follow this fun broken crack all the way to a nice ledge. This is a good, fun, mixed pitch, 120’, 5.10.\n\nPitch 4.\n\nFrom the ledge, climb easily past a few bolts to a short gear section and then a bolt below a small roof feature. Step left around the roof, easy, and continue up to another even nicer ledge below the crux pitch, 60’, 5.8, mixed protection.\n\nPitch 5.\n\nThis has the route's crux pitch - climb 5.9 terrain past several bolts. As the wall steepens, the climbing gets on you. Begin trending right past a couple of bolts, and hit a few stout moves, 11+. After clipping the final bolt, scoot right into a low angled corner. It is easy climbing in this section, but it would be probably wise to bring a finger-sized cam to protect this corner. Once you exit the corner, climb another 15’ on low angled rock to a 3 bolt anchor, 120’, 5.11+, bolts and a couple finger-sized pieces.\n\nDescent:\n\nOption 1. Walk up to the summit and down the gully to the left.\n\nOption 2. Scramble down and right to the anchors atop\n\nMeltdown\n\n, and do a full 35m rap as described on that route page. I would avoid rapping Tradding Water as there are many flakes that could snag your rope. Also you would need a second rope for getting down the long pitch.","protection":"Gear from red C3 to a #2 Camalot; doubles in 0.5, 0.75, and 1; 14 draws; and 4 long draws.","location":"Start by climbing\n\nGrave Line\n\n.
