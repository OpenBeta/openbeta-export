This line begins with flowing climbing up a pocketed slab with thin feet and then transitions to sloping jugs and a steepening crack.

It is a really fun, little line with great intuitive moment. If it were taller, it would be a 4 star classic. Also, this is the third easiest way to access the top of the dome Â (there are a couple 7/7+ cracks that aren't yet listed on MP) and the long, wandery Monitor summit pitch.
