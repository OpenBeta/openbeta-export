To start, wait in line, just kidding, there won't be a line.\n\nStarting off Printerboy ledge, far left side...\n\n1) The first pitch starts in and moves up the dihedral (5.9) clipping a pin or two for fun and placing gear when possible. As the crack pinches out, look for the bolt hangers, you might not see all of them, but they are up there. Some might say its run-out, some will think it's cool..The climbing is straightforward and typical Monitor easy (10a). Relax, climb, clip a bolt once an a while and placing gear. Eventually you will end up at a three bolt semi hanging belay.\n\n2) Â Pitch two moves up the face,off to the right, pass two bolts an arriving at Rasta-Ledge. Short pitch\n\n3) The final pitch of Rasta-Man follows the bolt to the left. (The obvious bolt line is\n\nDazed & Confused\n\n.)\n\nThe following I cannot recall at all...Maybe I just blocked it out, but I know Craig did it (per notes) and I think it was with his brother Cliff that finished off this pitch. Per my notes, from my personal hand drawn guide(circa 1998) it states the following....From Rasta ledge, look up and to the left for a bolt. As Craig Jirka said. Quote \"Clip the bolt, don't look back and turn the roof at the top.(5.10+)..Have fun.\" end Quote..I assume he put gear in at the roof. . So there you have it, If you've ever seen that bolt off to the left of Rasta-ledge, now you know...Rasta-Man","protection":"Bring two ropes. A light rack with small gear up to 3''. You won't need very much, runners for gear, quickdraws for the bolted face. There are fixed anchors on the top of 1st and 2nd pitches.Top of 3rd pitch (summit) is trad. walk off or rappel using anchors from\n\nDazed & Confused\n\n(11a).","location":"Rasta-Man\n\nstarts off the far left side of the\n\nPrinterboy Ledge\n\nand climbs\n\nSpace your Face\n\n. On the far left side of\n\nP/B l\n\nedge lives a fair size dihedral that tapers down and eventually pinches out to nothing leaving only a vast wall of face.

It is 155 feet of 10c climbing with good protection. The second pitch is 11a that is really runout! I wouldn't recommend this pitch.\n\nPer\n\nWes Peterson\n\n: start from the\n\nPrinterboy\n\nledge, directly over\n\nPrinterboy\n\n. This ledge can be accessed via multiple routes. The first pitch at 10c takes you up a surprisingly long, steep section with good rests and is well-protected, bring a minimum of 20 qiuckdraws. At 155', you'll arrive at spectacular little ledge with a bomber rappel station. The second pitch is the very reason you came this far. The rock is of the highest quality and beauty the Monitor has to offer. Your position on the Monitor is the middle of the very upper headwall looking up at the water streak. With a 11a move and good protection, move up. When the rock kicks to low angle, look left, and do easy climbing through a couple spaced out bolts. This is a great way to finish.\n\nWalk off or rap. The bomber rappel station is to climbers right at the very top. 2 60 meter ropes and 3 rappels finds the ground.","protection":"Bolts.
