The late Logan Jauernigg had the vision for this spectacular line, and it is a true area classic. The route was originally called \"The Gift\"; however, the community decided to rename this amazing line \"Logan's Gift\" in memory of the visionary young man who lost his life adventuring at far too young of an age. The route was plagued with a misplaced bolt, some microwave-sized death blocks, and a crux hold that needed reenforcing. After searching for Logan to discuss and consulting the community, I have updated this route so that it may shine in its full glory as one of Colorado's great 5.13s.
