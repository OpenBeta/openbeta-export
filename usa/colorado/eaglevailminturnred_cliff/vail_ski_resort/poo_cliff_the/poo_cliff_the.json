It is in the opening between the small hill and the thick tree, and it is the only thing besides the obvious, chossy jug haul that isn’t blank.\n\nStart squatting on some good underclings and make a few easy moves to get set up on a slot crimp and another crimp. From here, do a HUGE deadpoint over the lip to a small crimp that is hard to see. After that move, make one or two more moves to a sandy jug where you can drop. The movement on this climb is great, but I only gave it two stars because of the sand on the holds and the in obvious start.\n\nOverall, this is a very nice and fun climb that is well worth the hike!","protection":"No more than 3 pads are needed. Watch the dead point move so the climber doesn’t roll down the hill.","location":"This climb is right where there is the obvious roof is and the spot of no trees."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,f3569604-f6ac-52bc-8f61-0d524b52edd0,f936894a-19b0-50db-a848-36d4a6dfb270,586bd9be-10d5-51e0-a006-5b705ab29762","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Eagle/Vail/Minturn/Red Cliff","Vail Ski Resort","Poo Cliff, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.37562,39.6381]},"bbox":[-106.37620390661668,39.637650339818144,-106.3750360933833,39.63854966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113728586","area_id":"WGvZvhDVUeCgBltwWrKXYg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:05.771Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:19.974Z"}
