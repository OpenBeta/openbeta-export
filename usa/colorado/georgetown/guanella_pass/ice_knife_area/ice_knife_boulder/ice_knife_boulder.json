Also, it’s a worthwhile entry as I can help to sort out the several classic lines on this boulder.\n\nPoked by a Mermaid (the same as\n\nCarnage\n\n, I believe) was quickly put up by Daniel at V13, because the crew was, at the time, eluded by Ice Knife and figured they’d fill in the gaps while they were up there. While\n\nCarnage\n\nquickly got many repeats and solidified as a popular alpine V13, Mermaid remained rarely repeated for almost a decade. Word-class crimper Sam Weir finally got the job done and remarked that the line could be one of his hardest, comparing it with the likes of\n\nJade\n\n. Because of this, the problem has mostly just been a sandbagged mystery.\n\nAnyways, Mermaid starts sitting, the same as Ice Knife Sit, on opposing sidepulls. Pull on, and get a right kneebar to reach into the heinous undercling as for\n\nIce Knife\n\n. Where that problem follows the beautiful prow, Mermaid busts straight up and a little right through the tallest, blankest part of the face. Tiny crimps and huge lockoffs are the name of the game on this rig, and it’s not over until you reach the lip.","protection":"A comfortable amount of pads.

The first move is to a rad, left hand, sidepull sloper. From here, a kneebar leads to very consistent crimping on bad but rad holds. Whatever beta you choose, the finale comes with a nice pop to a sharp finger bucket. This is an ultra classic crimp line. It is intro level 13 for the style, I believe, but it certainly felt pretty solid for 13.","protection":"4-6 pads.","location":"It is to the right of\n\nThe Ice Knife\n\nand to the left of\n\nRainbow in the Dark\n\n."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ce04e16e-cfbd-59e8-a6d5-c86d5b1cdf08,63dd503e-37ff-5757-a585-9deb4facd25a,6f4f02a2-178b-5e60-87e7-5e317763506d,bebca201-3d85-5823-b7bc-efc5bb967fd1","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Georgetown","Guanella Pass","Ice Knife Area","Ice Knife Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V9-10"},{"count":1,"label":"V14"},{"count":1,"label":"V14-15"},{"count":1,"label":"V12-13"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":4}},"alpine":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":4}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":4}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.70009,39.66405]},"bbox":[-105.70067412583462,39.663600339818146,-105.6995058741654,39.66449966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117519899","area_id":"vryiAT2FWCO3vO/Fu5Z/0Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:03.028Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:13.972Z"}
