SDS low and to the right on a large, triangular flake. Move your right hand to the good sloper at the lip (use the drill holes if needed). Get your feet up, and work your way along the lip toward the big crack, until you secure the fin-shaped sidepull at the top right of the crack (see the top X in picture). The crux is going for the fin from a good, left hand sidepull on the face and a marginal right-hand sloper on the lip. Once you've secured the fin with your left hand, mantel to finish. Note, everything to the left of the crack is off. Though contrived, this makes for a more fun climb, in my opinion.","protection":"1 pad.","location":"It's on the only climbable face of the boulder (south side)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ce04e16e-cfbd-59e8-a6d5-c86d5b1cdf08,63dd503e-37ff-5757-a585-9deb4facd25a,02355ae1-0913-57ec-bb59-79435535cd32,c9aa4a68-8527-5c4c-a98b-5f6b19ddb436","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Georgetown","Guanella Pass","7 Mile Boulders","Cracked Lip Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.7093,39.63333]},"bbox":[-105.70988386635207,39.632880339818136,-105.70871613364793,39.633779660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115375447","area_id":"yapKaIUnXEypi19rGd20Ng=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:03.030Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:54.130Z"}
