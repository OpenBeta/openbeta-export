Because of how heavily soot filled the cave is from fires, the line is extremely obvious. Chalk mixes nicely with the soot, it is not messy or slick.\n\nMoving up the wall from your SDS...take the amazingly aesthetic roof line to the lip of the cave....there are lots of holds and great compression climbing to the lip.\n\nBomber holds on the lip await you and give you the chance to drop your feet and re-position for a kick up to a heel hook on to the right side of the cave lip. Trending to the left of the cave on the lip you will be looking for a ladder like set of crimpers that are to the right of the crux for \"\n\nOver The Rainbow\n\n\". Commit and make the throw to the crimpers to topout on the 4th class ledge. This is very committing...incredibly fun, it is the \"To Do\" problem at this crag.","protection":"Spotters and pads...it has a pretty nasty landing below the lip when you are pulling the roof.
