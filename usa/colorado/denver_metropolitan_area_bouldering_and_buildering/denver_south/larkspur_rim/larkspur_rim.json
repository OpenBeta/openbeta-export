Some friends had invited me to join them with a free ticket at a Stones concert at Folsom Field in Boulder that day, but I chose to climb. Looking back, I regret that choice. The rock would have waited for us.\n\nSteve and I climbed the wide crack to the top. We descended a 40-foot metal ladder beneath an old wire tower. You may be able to rappel from a tree near the rim, if you can find a sturdy one.","protection":"Offwidth gear.
