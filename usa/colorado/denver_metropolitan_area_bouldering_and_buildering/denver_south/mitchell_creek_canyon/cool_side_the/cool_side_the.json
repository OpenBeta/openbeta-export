Match, and walk your feet up for a committing move to a huge jug at the lip.\n\nVideo beta:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JimCowcvnxY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x0Pg1HKg3Y","protection":"Pads.","location":"From the obvious trail below the Corona Crag, take another well worn trail southeast across the stream.
