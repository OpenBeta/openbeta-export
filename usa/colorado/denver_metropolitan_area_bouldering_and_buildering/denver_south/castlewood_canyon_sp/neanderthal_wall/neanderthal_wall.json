A few feet higher the #3 tricam can be fiddled into a large pocket on the face.  It takes a minute to get it right, but it's pretty bomber.  Now, take a deep breath and punch through the crux under the right-facing corner/roof up to a long horizontal finger crack.  Place a good #1 Friend, then pull the roof to the top.  This route is spicy (Cajun style) but does not get an \"s\" rating if you can place the micro cam and tricam properly.\n\nThe anchor on top can be made with two medium/large stoppers in a crack parallel to the cliff edge about 15 back and to the left.  Use a long sling to get the rope over the edge.","protection":"The pro is funky on this route, since it's listed as a toprope in the guidebook, but some flexible stem cams ;-0 and tricams can be fiddled into pockets and small horizontal breaks.  Hard Grit, baby.\n\nThe following pieces work well: #0, 2, 1 Friends, #3 tricam.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"bfAercvyV72O55ebmpXOBQ==","name":"Bad Ass Pi Man","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Troy Halm, Hayden Fischer, July 2009","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.76843,39.35202]},"left_right_index":25,"mp_id":"106837622","mp_crag_id":"105744570","climb_id":"bfAercvyV72O55ebmpXOBQ==","areaRef":"gwVotsw5XiKn9DcHuBPRcw=="},"content":{"description":"Hike south of the Grocery Store Wall until you come to the chimney.
