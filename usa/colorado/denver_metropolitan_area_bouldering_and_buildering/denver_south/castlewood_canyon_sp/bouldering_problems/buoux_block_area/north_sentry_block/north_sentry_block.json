It is an obvious climb that sits just below the Buoux Block and has commanding views of the valley.\n\nThis slightly overhanging crack is the source of water runoff from the top and has thus made most of the crack very smooth.\n\nIt would be the perfect highball boulder problem if it wasn't for the sketchy landing.\n\nYou can easily see this boulder from the Creek Bottom Trail. Just stop at the waterfall overlook and look for the big face with a perfect split crack on the hill above it.","protection":"The landing is really hard to protect and makes the top of the climb a serious commitment.\n\nFirst off, you start standing on a boulder that is another 3-4 feet off of the ground and just big enough for a normal pad. However, the ground falls off quickly to your backside.\n\nTo properly protect this will require at least two attentive (and preferably tall) spotters, at least one pad for the landing, and at least one to protect some rocks.\n\nRegardless of the quality of spotting, a bad fall could mean you end up rolling through the scrub-oak.","location":"Enter the West Entrance and park in the Falls Parking lot. Cross above the falls and immediately take a left and hike along the mud-cliffs. The boulder is about 100 yards up the hill almost directly above the actual waterfall.\n\nIt is just down the hill from the Buoux Block and just North of the Plate Rock/Orange Boulder area.\n\nIn the C-wood bouldering map, it is in the Buoux Block \"pink-colored\" section.\n\nmountainproject.com/images/â€¦"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,59110948-7028-589b-987e-5282f1fb0897,7df5a5dd-bff8-5ba0-abf4-1b3142f9ebc9,a4aef32e-321a-5c31-896b-88992dc2273d,e5e6ecbf-165b-52d8-aee3-007ca55332b8,aca7446c-ad83-5c19-8cc9-e7d21ec1135d,309cf2cf-c70e-5a2a-80d3-b4c52df22f09","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Denver Metropolitan Area Bouldering and Buildering","Denver South","Castlewood Canyon SP","Bouldering problems","Buoux Block area","North Sentry Block"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2-3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.76015,39.34772]},"bbox":[-104.76073147285898,39.34727033981814,-104.75956852714103,39.34816966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108511705","area_id":"MJzyz8cOWiqA07TFLfIvCQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-104.76073147285898,39.34727033981814],[-104.75956852714103,39.34727033981814],[-104.75956852714103,39.34816966018187],[-104.76073147285898,39.34816966018187],[-104.76073147285898,39.34727033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:49.289Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:08.363Z"}
