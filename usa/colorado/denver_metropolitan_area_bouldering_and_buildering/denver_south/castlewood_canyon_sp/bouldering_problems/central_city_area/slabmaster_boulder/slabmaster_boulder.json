The right side of the main pebble face contains a really good slabbly problem with just enough pebbles and pockets to get to the top. The other problems are all in the V2ish to V4 grade across the two faces and along the arete; bring a good brush....\n\nIt has great views of the whole canyon as well.","protection":"Couple pads, good landing.","location":"Located somewhere between the Nine Lives Boulder and Dr. Love's, this prominent and easier to find boulder is just 50 yards North (out of the canyon) from the Scary Monsters Boulder.\n\nPark in the back entrance and follow the directions to any of the other blocks above.\n\nBeware, while easier to find then the Scary Monsters Boulder, it is located near some of the most insanely dense scrub oak in C-Wood.
