Turn right, and hike up a hundred feet (past some rad problems) to the boulders (Turd Balls).  Unless you're blind, you will immediately notice the beautiful, horrifying, wonderful spaceship formation in the middle of the area.\n\nSpaceman Spiff comes in from the left arete of the prow (not using the lower block for feet, but it'd still be good otherwise), then it busts into one of the raddest bearhug maneuvers ever.  On the (?)
