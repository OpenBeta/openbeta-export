To find this problem, go to the East Entrance of Castlewood (the one with the visitor center), and hike in on the Inner-Canyon trail for 10 minutes or so. Look for the powerlines that go across the canyon, as that is the general area of the problem. At that point along the trail, you come to a place where the pine-trees cover the trail (all other areas are mostly just scrub-oak trees), and there will be a prominent easy-boulder that can be climbed right on the trail with a flat face. Just to the right of that boulder is a small trail heading up the hillside. Follow this trail uphill for a short distance until you run into a cluster of boulders.\n\nTiger Woods is the first major boulder on the left with a perfect, overhanging face and the prominent sloper hold in the middle."},"__v":0},{"_id":"fn9y7JYHUTSZ6ODFnZlV7w==","name":"Minor in Possession","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"Andrew Hodnett","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.74934,39.33816]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"116576685","mp_crag_id":"108511872","climb_id":"fn9y7JYHUTSZ6ODFnZlV7w==","areaRef":"OkeECDh1WOqMoK28LxodTw=="},"content":{"description":"Start on a small edge with your right hand and an obvious little ledge for your feet.
