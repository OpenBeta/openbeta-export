Begin on two small pockets and do a jump/swing move to a good pod, cross match, and do the crux.\n\nThis is in the top five in the Wood.\n\nMatt Lloyd on Climbing\n\nvimeo.com/5850768\n\nfrom\n\nNelson Carayannis\n\non\n\nVimeo\n\n.","protection":"A few pads.  The perfect rock (seriously the best in C-Wood) turns chossy at about 15 feet so either steer left and take on the choss or escape right on a slab.  Both get the same grade.","location":"It is at the Electric Kite Wall.  From the very first parking lot on the left (by the old house), go back to the road and hike about 50 yards past where the pavement ends and the dirt road begins.  Go virtually straight uphill, there is not really a path, so be careful bushwhacking.  If you hit the cliff band on the left side, you will see a cave with several chossy problems (that end on the ledge).  You need to go about 200 yards (up canyon,\n\ni.e.\n\nnorth towards rt 86) to find the line."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,59110948-7028-589b-987e-5282f1fb0897,7df5a5dd-bff8-5ba0-abf4-1b3142f9ebc9,a4aef32e-321a-5c31-896b-88992dc2273d,e5e6ecbf-165b-52d8-aee3-007ca55332b8,52824738-e521-5ad4-adc8-93f9ea6fa4f9,058ea33f-d032-5d52-aa64-933476490041","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Denver Metropolitan Area Bouldering and Buildering","Denver South","Castlewood Canyon SP","Bouldering problems","Five and Dime Area","Electric Kite Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8-9"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.76846,39.35947]},"bbox":[-104.76904157065555,39.359020339818144,-104.76787842934448,39.35991966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108511237","area_id":"BY6jP9AyXVKqZJM0dkkAQQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:48.094Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:16.746Z"}
