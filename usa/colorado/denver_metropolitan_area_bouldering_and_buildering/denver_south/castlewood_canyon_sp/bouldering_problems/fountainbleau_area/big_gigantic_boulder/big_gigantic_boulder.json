Start in the monopocket with right hand in the middle of the blank face, grabbing the rock on your left. Move up the left face, using the edges and stones to ease your way up, staying on the face and avoiding the far left flake. Grab the two stones to help set your feet, then reach out and snag that big stone 12 feet up. Place a careful right foot, grab the last stone on your left, then shoot for the lip! Use a few decent pebbles to help your topout.\n\n(I was thinking of some cool name for this route, one that would really capture the experience. Well, the name sounds cool, but it came from something a bit different than you'd imagine. Working this route took me around an hour, and while I was figuring out the beta, my dogs were tied to a tree 8 feet away. They nervously watched me, cried the entire time, and only stopped when I came over to pet them. I couldn't get that experience out of my head, hence the name.)","protection":"1 crashpad.","location":"It is on Big, Gigantic Boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"Uwpc8PjGXlCiI4a8w55aCA==","name":"Mr. Tree","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"Eric C.","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.76966,39.35744]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"116188160","mp_crag_id":"116188025","climb_id":"Uwpc8PjGXlCiI4a8w55aCA==","areaRef":"9nhr85XFXdOCzwlSguVlMw=="},"content":{"description":"This problem starts on the stone below the first ledge.
