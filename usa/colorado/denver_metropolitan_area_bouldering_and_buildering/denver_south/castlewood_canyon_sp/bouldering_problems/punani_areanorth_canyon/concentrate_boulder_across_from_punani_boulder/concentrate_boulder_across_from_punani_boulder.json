The start is fairly inobvious under the roof:  right hand on a fat, open pinch cobble about a foot away from the thick flake/crack and left hand on a dishy sidepull.  Right foot gets to start stuffed in the horizontal, chossy ledge/flake/crack thing.... Blast out very poor sloping holds with tension before gaining generous holds and the tall but very easy top out (20 feet ish?).\n\nFrom Concentrate Assis starts on the obvious, but lower quality start:  hands matched in the horizontal, choss, flake, jug crack of mouse turd death.  The feet continue to evolve as compacted mud is brushed out of the feature. ADMIT THIS SOUNDS CLASSIC!  ADMIT IT RIGHT NOW!
