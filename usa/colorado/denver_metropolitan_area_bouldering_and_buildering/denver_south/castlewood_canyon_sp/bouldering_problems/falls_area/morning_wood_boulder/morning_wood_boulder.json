Morning Wood is not a destination rock for any serious boulderer, but it is close to parking and offers several fun problems with mostly pockets. I've used it as a warm-up before shooting downhill straight east to the Dungeon or\n\nNine Lives Arete\n\n. The V1 traverse is best from right to left.\n\nIn addition, there are several pocket-pulling top-outs, the thinnest one is maybe V3.","protection":"Flat landing, not too tall. Still high enough to recommend a pad.","location":"About halfway between the Cave Trail parking lot and the Falls Trail lot, along the interconnecting trail, there is a trail branch that heads east. Follow this down past a curve and over a little drainage and uphill to a couple mini boulders. At these, bushwhack a little downhill and south towards the drainage and you'll see it. All in all, no more than 200 yards from your car whichever of the 2 lots you park in."},"__v":0},{"_id":"lmVJjtV6VJGE2Rb5IahM+g==","name":"Gumby Pocket","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"Nathan Singleton","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.76415,39.34895]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"117075235","mp_crag_id":"108511407","climb_id":"lmVJjtV6VJGE2Rb5IahM+g==","areaRef":"g6CNDCD4U8OG2Ad4LYl9pg=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start with both of your hands on a flake.
