A chimney system is around the corner to the left of this face.  The first bolt is about 20ft off the deck, but easy ramps lead up to it.  The first clip is not a trivial clip, however, since a few thin moves must be made to reach it.  It is a little runout to the second bolt.  Angle up and left past a short finger crack to a horizontal crack below a small roof.  Clip the last bolt, then crank to the top.  This would be a two-star route if some of the loose rocks were cleaned.","protection":"5 bolts--no anchor on top.
