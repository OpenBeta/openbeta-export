It stems in between the pillars right in front of the windows. This will go for any of the windows. It has easy stemming all the way up, with an exciting but easy topout. The crux is honestly getting off the ground. I rated it R, but it could be PG-13 or X, it is hard to say. The placements in the cracks on either side fit cams perfectly however the quality of the building material is highly questionable, and I would not recommend shock loading it, although it may hold a fall.\n\nThe cracks on either side are slightly different sizes and flaring.\n\nBring plenty of cord, and belay off the huge generator on the roof. I used two 30 feet pieces you may be able to do it with one, but it would be really tight and harder to belay.\n\nAbseil off the railing to descend.","protection":"If you start on the right side of the the fire alarm:\n\nThe crack on left takes #2-3 C4s.\n\nThe crack on right takes #3-4 C4s.\n\nVice-versa if you start on the left side of the fire alarm.","location":"Start in the break in the bushes on either side of the fire alarm."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,59110948-7028-589b-987e-5282f1fb0897,ffa868e9-976b-5394-9705-6e06d9e2b4ad,74f51305-391a-5a08-9304-d208148fdf94","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Denver Metropolitan Area Bouldering and Buildering","DU Campus Bouldering/Buildering","Physics Building"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.96257,39.67293]},"bbox":[-104.96315420091557,39.67248033981814,-104.96198579908446,39.67337966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117880677","area_id":"dPUTBTkaWgiTBNIIFI/flA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-104.96315420091557,39.67248033981814],[-104.96198579908446,39.67248033981814],[-104.96198579908446,39.67337966018186],[-104.96315420091557,39.67337966018186],[-104.96315420091557,39.67248033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:46.020Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:04.792Z"}
