The route is short, but the exposure is wild and intimidating at first. There's not a lot of beta, you have to layback the arete and smear your feet on almost nothing for the first 3 bolts. It gets much easier after that, but you will still be wondering why you feel so gripped and insecure on a 40 foot route.
