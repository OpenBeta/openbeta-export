Some non-Reggae types apparently started calling it something different, hence the perpetual confusion. On a side note, I named the problem to the right \"Do Not Name this Problem.\" Looking back, it makes me think there was already some confusion about \"Harder They Come,\" and I was fed up with correcting people about names.\"\n\nThis is a steep, excellent problem that will test your crimp strength. While the rock quality may be slightly lower than other area classics, it is certainly worth getting on.\n\nBegin sitting, matched on a large undercling. Get down to business right away with powerful moves between crystally edges.
