Once standing underneath the wall, it just begs to be climbed. It has excellent movement on unique rock. Easily one of the best routes of the grade in the Poudre, this one gets all the stars in my book, which may not be saying much. Come try it, and you decide!\n\nThere are essentially four distinct sections with two good rests. Start with an interesting boulder problem traversing along the mini-arete, and immediately fire into compression climbing on the wing feature, culminating in an airy traverse to the rest underneath the roof. Pull the roof into the finger crack on sweet locks leading to another rest before performing the final thin and balancy redpoint crux. Enjoy easier climbing and swirly rock to the anchor.","protection":"10 bolts + a 2 bolt anchor.","location":"It is in the dead center of the wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,58343ac7-d09d-502d-80d2-8c6694f7c914,f27f00b7-1968-5942-bffb-931b2cd00345,8d173b36-c2fd-5494-aa98-344e8901142f,e73d4fcf-8cfc-56c0-b1fd-2c9345fe2a9f","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Fort Collins","Poudre Canyon","West of Rustic","Attacking Hawk Crag"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.72865,40.71576]},"bbox":[-105.72924325450478,40.71531033981814,-105.72805674549524,40.716209660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121805977","area_id":"5z1Pz4z8VsCx/SyTRf4qnw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:58.283Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:06.369Z"}
