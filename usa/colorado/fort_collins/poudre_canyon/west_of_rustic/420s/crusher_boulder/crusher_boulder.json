There is a burn barrel next to the problem (imagine hobos keeping warm).\n\nAccess: I'm pretty sure this is on public land (as opposed to the private Kingpin boulder).  Keep a low profile as there are a couple cabins with 30 feet of this problem.  They don't want to hear boulderers wimpering all day.\n\nOnly problem on the boulder.  Sitdown start under boulder with hand pinching arete feature.  Come out to hold at lip and pull over lip.  I broke the hold at the lip (spring 2002) and it's now slightly harder (but better!)\n\nCool problem especially because it can be hard for short and tall people.  Hard to reach holds for shorties but hard as hell to move those feet onto the lip for tall people.  Thus, this grade is just a ballpark.","protection":"flat landing, 1-2 pads","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"30ciK550WnanGZDS5uJ5CQ==","name":"Crushed Ice","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"Chip Phillips & Justin Jaeger, 2003","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.77776,40.69935]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105761418","mp_crag_id":"116161501","climb_id":"30ciK550WnanGZDS5uJ5CQ==","areaRef":"vIq59ZzEVJWsYrqfAi4qag=="},"content":{"description":"Crushed Ice is on the east/southeast face of the same boulder as Crusher. This boulder appears to be near the property boundary, so tread lightly and be respectful. For your reference, this boulder is about 30 yards west of the Kingpin Boulder (which is on private property) and 20 yards east from the boulder that has Toaster, Tollbooth Willy and the Willy Arete. To further clarify, this cluster of boulders is about 100 yards east of the Tilt/Divergence/Crazy Cody/Cloudwalker Area.\n\nAnyway, the problem ascends the 80 degree east/southeast-facing slab. Walk around the corner clockwise from Crusher and you will see the slab. Right of the seam that peters out, ascend the 16 foot slab on mostly thin crimps.\n\nWe cleaned the hell out of this problem, but plenty of lichen may remain particularly up high. In other words, be careful if you choose to smear on anything.","protection":"a crashpad and spotter","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,58343ac7-d09d-502d-80d2-8c6694f7c914,f27f00b7-1968-5942-bffb-931b2cd00345,8d173b36-c2fd-5494-aa98-344e8901142f,d4c0c286-649c-53e9-a73c-1c7da052789a,bc8ab9f5-9cc4-5495-ac62-ba9f022e2a6a","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Fort Collins","Poudre Canyon","West of Rustic","420s","Crusher Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"},{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.77776,40.69935]},"bbox":[-105.77835310833544,40.698900339818145,-105.77716689166458,40.699799660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116161501","area_id":"vIq59ZzEVJWsYrqfAi4qag==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.77835310833544,40.698900339818145],[-105.77716689166458,40.698900339818145],[-105.77716689166458,40.699799660181874],[-105.77835310833544,40.699799660181874],[-105.77835310833544,40.698900339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:58.957Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:41.334Z"}
