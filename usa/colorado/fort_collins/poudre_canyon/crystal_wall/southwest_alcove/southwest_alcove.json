A lead fall would yank your belayer around some pretty uncomfortable terrain if s/he isn't clipped in.\n\nClimb up through some blocky terrain (5.7-5.9) through the first three bolts to gain the left face of the striking, orange prow seen from the alcove.  Move up on some tiny, lichen-y holds (5.10/11) to a crux that starts just beneath the 2nd to last bolt.\n\nAt this point, I did a bit of 'aid' climbing to reach around the corner of the arete into a wide fissure that offered some usable holds.  The climbing was not at all obvious, and harder than any of main wall P1s or\n\nBallet of the Bulge\n\n.  Definitely 11-something, possibly harder, and also possible to cheat your way around, as I did.\n\nClip the last bolt as the terrain eases and top out!  It is a sport climb, but it's sort of epic.  Whether or not you agree with that, the good climbing, neat feature, and fun topout make for an excellent route.","protection":"9 bolts.\n\nTwo options for anchors - top out and belay from the 3-bolt set-up on top of the pillar, or break right at the 2nd to last bolt and make a reach for the fat Metolius rap bolts on the downhill face of the prow.\n\nI topped out and belayed from the 3-bolt anchor, but rappelled off from the 2 bolts on the orange face with one 60m rope, and then walked off and around back to the alcove.  Rapping from the 3-bolt setup off the overhanging face could finish with your rope stuck in a rotten crack at the edge of the prow.\n\nAlternately, one could be lowered or rappel from the 3-bolt setup down the route to the belay anchors.","location":"This line climbs the left face of the prow visible way up the gully from\n\nInyerbuttkwa\n\nor\n\nBallet of the Bulge\n\n.  The 2-bolt 'belay anchor' mentioned above is ~15' down and slightly left of the base of the prow, as seen from the alcove.\n\nThis feature is also visible from the Palace pull-out, and looks pretty stunning from there; a large, clean, orange prow jutting out of the choss-pile behind Crystal, upper right in the photo.
