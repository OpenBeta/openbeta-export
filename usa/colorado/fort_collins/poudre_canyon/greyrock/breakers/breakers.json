The route is immediately left of an obvious roof-crack called Fisticuffs (10c). Props to J. Brink and P. McGrane, this route is a gem and a proud send.\n\nBouldery moves over an initial bulge gain the first bolt (an old rusty hunk of metal). Enjoy excellent climbing up quartzite, passing two more bolts. The crux comes shortly after the third bolt and involves thin friction moves to gain a sloping horizontal crack. Mantel onto the face above and choose your poison - the obvious line leading directly up on thin holds left of the watermark (possible death or serious injury inducing fall potential here on sold 5.9+ terrain) or make some thin face moves out right (like I did) to gain the slightly easier, though still very runout slab that hugs the right side of the watermark.Protection presents itself in horizontal cracks above.

Possibly the best 5.10 trad line at Greyrock! Instead of the usual thin-face moves and slab-slithering, this route involves sustained lie-backing, face climbing, and jamming! I also thought this route was really solid (hard) for the grade.\n\nStart up easy ground to gain a thin, finger crack, lieback up to the obvious bulge, work your way left to gain the left-leaning dihedral roof, and follow this to the break midway through (Frightline Roof - 11a - takes the first crack through the roof, and Frightline Direct - 11 -continues through the seem near the end of the dihedral). This shallow crack is the crux and is currenty filled with dirt and vegitation, but good fist/hand jams are still to be had! Crank over the roof and continue up more classy (though more moderate) 5.8 ground above to reach a tree-sling anchor.\n\nRap to the ground with 2 sixy meter ropes or walk off to the left.
