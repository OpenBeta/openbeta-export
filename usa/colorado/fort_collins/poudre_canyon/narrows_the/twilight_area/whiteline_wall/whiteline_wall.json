Small cams could be placed between fixed pieces to supplement, but were not used establishing the route.\n\nFrom the bolted anchors at the top edge of the route, descend 25 meters to a small stance at a grassy ledge with a single bolt & a quicklink. If lowering, be wary of sharp edges and consider protecting the rope.\n\nClimb delicately left through a series of underclings, and work your way around the small arete. Push up and right on an easy slab with no fixed gear. Crimp through the first steep wall, and mantel onto the central ledge. Compose yourself at a full rest, then punch through a series of steep crimps and laybacks, up to the big moves on the upper wall.\n\nOnce the rope has been pulled, escape other than the route is unlikely. Consider this before committing to the lower ledge, and be sure to glance back at the Whiteline rapids beneath as you mantel out.","protection":"The route is protected with 5 bolts and 3 pins.\n\nOptional 0.4 and 0.5 cams.","location":"The bolted anchor is\n\non a slab\n\nunderneath the juniper tree.\n\nApproach this by 3rd / 4th class terrain with fixed hand line just north of the Juniper."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,58343ac7-d09d-502d-80d2-8c6694f7c914,f27f00b7-1968-5942-bffb-931b2cd00345,3c0a2e33-b8e1-54cd-8c13-2a953fd9a738,7d4bade6-5c03-58bd-9a33-b3562afe8fde,2b2b467d-7307-58ee-b042-7e7efca515e0","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Fort Collins","Poudre Canyon","Narrows, The","Twilight Area","Whiteline Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.43036,40.67712]},"bbox":[-105.43095291051777,40.676670339818145,-105.42976708948218,40.677569660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118791710","area_id":"KytGfXMHWO6wQn5+/KUV4A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.43095291051777,40.676670339818145],[-105.42976708948218,40.676670339818145],[-105.42976708948218,40.677569660181874],[-105.43095291051777,40.677569660181874],[-105.43095291051777,40.676670339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:54.734Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:37.257Z"}
