From here, climb past 2 bolts in the slab to finally reach the main wall.\n\nStart by doing a sort of leaning traverse up and left on big jugs. Be careful around the 2nd bolt, because your belayer cannot see you and the ledge/slab are pretty close. Get a rest at the break/horizontal, and pull up into the ramp/arch feature. The climbing is strangely hard to read and pumpy through this large feature. Above the ramp/arch feature lies the real heartbreak crux on small holds with a big throw to the slopey jug next to the chains.","protection":"12 bolts, extra long slings for the bottom, 2-bolt anchor.","location":"This route is the right-most line on the Wild Wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"2sb4M3V4XQyN9kqpNyIq/A==","name":"Rustic Wilderness","yds":"5.13b","grades":{"yds":"5.13b","french":"8a"},"fa":"Equip: S.
