I initially bolted this route to clean and suss back in 2010. I tried it on and off over the years but could never figure out a viable sequence that gave me any hope of a send. This year, out of the blue, I decided to throw my left knee up on the rail feature and boom. A relatively easy sequence emerged, and I finished it off a week later. Amazing how something that felt impossible for years suddenly becomes very very feasible.\n\nInitially tried as a boulder problem, this route shed an enormous flake which made free-climbing safer but harder. Climb into the rail feature, and do a long move to a flat edge. This move is made much less strenuous by using a left knee pad.
