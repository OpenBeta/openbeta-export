Start with feet on the broken/crumbly base of the tower (foot holds might break off).

The first clip is somewhat taxing (stick clip isn't a bad idea if this is your limit). The rest of the route is very well bolted. The crux comes about 25 feet off the ground when moving over the obvious bulge using the crack. Generally, the holds are very solid and the moves are big. This route might be a little more difficult for shorter people. Make sure you stay to the right, as the features seem to make you want to move left.\n\nThe last 1/3 of the climb (once you get to the big crack system) is easier in comparison. If the rock quality was better (particularly at the base) and the difficulty stayed more consistent, this route would definitely be four stars. This is a great one nonetheless.","protection":"13 bolts and two anchors with chains. At least a 60m rope.","location":"This route is on the northwest face of the Citadel tower formation.
