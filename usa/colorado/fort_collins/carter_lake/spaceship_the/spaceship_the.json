But where's the line?\n\nAfter a hundred different variations, I think I've boiled it down to a smooth, fun line that goes something like this:\n\nLayback the nice edges at the Cockpit of the Spaceship to get your feet off the ground on the overhanging face.  A couple of long reaches gets you to bomber edges along the Arete.\n\nNow, instead of continuing straight up the arete(which makes the climb easier and is a fine alternative), follow a line of nice crisp edges right, out onto the overhanging face.  Watch your feet.  Reach for the crisp horizontal on the right side of the face a few feet below the pointed summit.  Now, fire straight up the prow using small, but good, chickenheads and snag the pointed arrowhead summit - victory!","protection":"The arete leans over a large, slanting rock, so a moving pad or a spotter moving a pad, or multiple pads would be nice.  It's not a long fall, but it's not flat, either.","location":"Start at the flat, sandy South side base of the Spaceship, grabbing hold of edges on the Cockpit."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,58343ac7-d09d-502d-80d2-8c6694f7c914,990e5b12-92be-5206-8090-7092a8be01db,b1efc5c5-95c7-5a6b-9ef8-52f41b8bd704","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Fort Collins","Carter Lake","Spaceship, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2139,40.32032]},"bbox":[-105.21448976553206,40.319870339818145,-105.21331023446793,40.32076966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106063011","area_id":"se/FxZXHWmue+FL0G4vXBA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.21448976553206,40.319870339818145],[-105.21331023446793,40.319870339818145],[-105.21331023446793,40.32076966018187],[-105.21448976553206,40.32076966018187],[-105.21448976553206,40.319870339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:02.009Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:32:45.873Z"}
