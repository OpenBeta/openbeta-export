Heck, it isn't even in any guidebook.  However, when I first tried the V2 on this rock, this seemed a natural escape from the vicious overhanging edges on that route, and turned out to be quite fun.\n\nStart on the horizontal flake at midheight.  Climb small but nice edges up the overhanging face to a clean, sharp horizontal edge.  Spot the flat-topped edge to the right, set up and fire for it from the horizontal.\n\nWork straight up from this flat-topped edge to the topout and go check out the supposed 2X4 hold that tops out the V2.","protection":"Boulder pad is nice.","location":"On the right side of the 2X4 Boulder, the flat-topped edge easy to identify above the overhang."},"__v":0},{"_id":"H6Vygd68W9isMCImfYmDaA==","name":"2X4 Righthand","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.214,40.32055]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"112530939","mp_crag_id":"106071071","climb_id":"H6Vygd68W9isMCImfYmDaA==","areaRef":"Ipj3CP+fX7uPdC7UyLp+rw=="},"content":{"description":"This problem climbs an unlikely line on the right side of the boulder, just left of the vague arete. Start on the obvious, flat edge at the base of a dihedral feature, and reach left for a small spike. Go right to a hidden letterbox edge and then left to a good crimp.
