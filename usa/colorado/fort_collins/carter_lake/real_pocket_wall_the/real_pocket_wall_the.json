So choice.  Not that hard, high, or dramatic but oh-so aesthetic.\n\nThe start holds are bomber horizontals so you might as well kick it up a notch - pull the feet up off the ground is your first mission.  Bump up to the next horizontal to allow for a comfortable heel hook.  Go left out the small roof to the next set of horizontals and keep moving your feet up.\n\nThe crux comes above the small roof on the superb north slab.
