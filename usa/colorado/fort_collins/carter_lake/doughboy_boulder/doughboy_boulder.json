It climbs the Northeast arete of the doughboy boulder. Start with a left hand in the obvious, fist-sized pocket on the east-facing wall and a right hand on the arete. Figure out a way to get yourself up to the sidepull above the pocket with your left hand. Now comes the hard part. You have to get yourself up the arete by slapping and finding interesting foot placements. Halfway up there's a little rest and then a scary couple of moves to the top. If you think Kahuna roof is still the best route at Carter after sending, this I'll be surprised.","protection":"Please fill in.","location":"It is between the Little Debbie Boulder and the Kahuna Boulder.
