Most commonly done right to left (uphill), this traverse has two back-to-back cruxes at the end that will tax your finger and core strength.\n\nStart on the good incut crimps of Despuntia Dudes, the right (northwest) arete of the boulder. Move left on good jugs and slopers until you hit a crimpy, high-steppy crux about 2/3 of the way across. Pimp into a shallow hueco/slot, shake out, and continue left via hard pulls crossing an overhanging dihedral.\n\nFinish out by either stepping left around the northeast arete onto the slab, or by topping out the Northeast Arete itself. This traverse is always shady, so it's a better bet on hot days than the west-facing Sergeant Woody Traverse.\n\nA much harder advent, Train in Vain (V10), crosses the west face of the block on crozzly, pebbly crimpers, then scoots around the arete to join the Monster Traverse.","protection":"A pad or two, and a spotter to slide them along with you.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"8NCatgVeVSWfvegH869HbA==","name":"Krum","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"??","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.2136,40.322]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105757705","mp_crag_id":"105746045","climb_id":"8NCatgVeVSWfvegH869HbA==","areaRef":"WDXlA0x9X4+/SsIzo/nNkQ=="},"content":{"description":"This is one problem left of Despuntia Dudes, the line up the northwest arete of the boulder.
