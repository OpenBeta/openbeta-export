A Northern Colorado testpiece. This has beautiful and wildly exposed, quality, granite face climbing. It is bouldery with dynos and fat kid climbing as well. Also it is technical.... This thing has it all! 3 pitches of glory! DO IT! Please leave comments about your experience. This thing is so special.\n\nPitch 1: climb a 5.11a approach pitch. This is alpine with ledges, jugs, and some interesting moves to a great belay, 6 bolts.\n\nPitch 2: 5.13a/b. Ascend AMAZING, exposed, wild face-climbing with great rests between boulder problems with 2 dynos. A final bulge leads to an airy, runout dyno and mantel a huge jug to the next belay, 13 bolts.\n\nPitch 3: this is a long 12b pitch with good rests and many interesting boulder problems including a funky mantel. Top out to a glorious and exposed view, and walk out the way you came, 13 bolts.","protection":"It is sport.
