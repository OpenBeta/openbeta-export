Many variations exist, and it's one of the most obvious and intimidating lines from the ground. Find the large roof.

A #4 Camalot also comes in handy as well.\n\nMake sure you have an attentive belayer/spotter for the first few feet of the climb as the gear is marginal.\n\nClimb this to the base of the roof, and build an anchor.\n\nP2 (20m, 5.10-): this pitch is intimidating, but it eats gear, and the feet are more positive than the looks of it. Climb through the roof, and move around the corner and up to a two bolt belay. Thin gear.\n\nP3 (45m, 5.10 R/X): climb into the Gully 5.9R, and build a belay or skip the belay (using triple length runners), and climb the 5.10R/X Chimney that happens to be the Horsetooth Gap.\n\nAlternate P3 (40m, 5.11-): climb the last pitch of Craig Luebben's sport route -\n\nStraight into the Horse's Mouth\n\n.\n\nDescent: to descend the middle tooth, you can either rap off the top (SHIT LOADS OF DRAG) or downclimb/rap partially into the 4th class chimney to the east.","protection":"Double rack to #3 Camalot.
