Utilize both solid and rattly hands, rings, and fingers until the obvious crack begins to wane at an intermediate anchor.\n\nPast that anchor, the severity gets turned up through easier 5.12 crimping. The precariously balanced boulder that was once far above and to the right, is now almost just beneath you and getting closer with every move. A tricky, yet crucial, #2 placement helps protect this a bit, but consider padding the boulder gritstone style as well. A quick crimp battle through the bulge is protected by a high bolt and a short runout on easy terrain gives way to the final anchor.\n\nToprope access for the crux is made clean and easy by stick clipping the intermediate anchors from atop the boulder. TR access for the full route can be set up from the summit by hiking up the east side of the feature and utilizing a bolted anchor to reach the top of the route.","protection":"Singles 0.4-#3\n\nDoubles 0.75, #1, & #2 (give or take)\n\nA few quickdraws","location":"A detailed approach can found in the climbing area map feature.\n\nThis is the main fracture splitting the massive overhanging wall on the south face of Outer Space Rock, under the balanced boulder.
