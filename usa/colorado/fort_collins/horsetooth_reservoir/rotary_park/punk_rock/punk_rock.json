A pad or a spotter is recommended for the topout as there is a rock you could fall on. Otherwise, the majority of the climb is pretty close to the ground, so if you fall, there's no real danger. This problem certainly has been climbed plenty of times before; however, it wasn't posted on mountainproject, and now it is.
