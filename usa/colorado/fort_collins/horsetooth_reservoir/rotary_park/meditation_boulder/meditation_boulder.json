This problem, to traverse the entire problem, no holds eliminated, is a great moderate problem.  Most traverse starting on the easy East side fof the South Face and traverse counterclockwise around the boulder.  Teaches one how to use one's feet, shake out after a pump, and packs in the moves.  Among the separate cruxes divided by rests, in order one will encounter, are the thin crimp rail of the east face, the odd sloping (if one stays low) moves and seam of the north face, the technically complicated west face which becomes easier and easier as one wires the moves and learns the intricate balance, plus the final powerful traverse above the [south] roof.","protection":"Essentially a safe traverse if one stays low and within one's abilities.

Left of the roof on the south face of Meditation boulder is a series of three of four holds at chest level which the standard\n\nMeditation Low Traverse\n\nfollow.  Below the last at belly button (depending) level is a dish just before the roof.  Start with hands matched on this hold.
