PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I understand the small crimp(s) above the finishing rail are chipped.  This would make the name most appropriate.\n\nThe line starts on the good flakes (seen in the right of Alan's photo), just left of the slabs off a boulder. Traverse the bulge from right to left to the good rail at waist height around the corner.  This traverse alone is V3+/V4.  Next, figure out the interesting moves to exit the wall straight up from this rail.  Uses the evil chipped edge(s) above the rail. The exit moves are stout, thin and interesting and are at least V4, if not harder. The whole line is given V7 in Benningfield and the Hang handout.","protection":"A pad and a spotter are nice, especially for the exit moves.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,58343ac7-d09d-502d-80d2-8c6694f7c914,e2cb5e6d-b1d1-57ec-a75b-a2fbf580feb1,d5f398bf-e4cb-5f49-8f24-c04bfe0103f8,43d57184-ba47-599c-8277-c55e3209ebae","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Fort Collins","Horsetooth Reservoir","Rotary Park","North Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V2"},{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":3,"label":"V0"},{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":7,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.15671,40.56769]},"bbox":[-105.15730193995311,40.56724033981815,-105.15611806004686,40.56813966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106535510","area_id":"Q9VxhLpHWZyCd8VeMgnrrg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.15730193995311,40.56724033981815],[-105.15611806004686,40.56724033981815],[-105.15611806004686,40.56813966018186],[-105.15730193995311,40.56813966018186],[-105.15730193995311,40.56724033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:53.403Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:04.853Z"}
