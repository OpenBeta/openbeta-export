This is a long traverse, probably one of the longest at Rotary. Not necessarily a very difficult route, but its just so dang long. The crux is the last move (the 21st), the rock is also pretty sharp, so be careful.","protection":"One crash pad to protect you from the rock below the last move.","location":"From the Talent Scout, follow paths down to the water, you can see the gigantic rock the whole walk down."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,58343ac7-d09d-502d-80d2-8c6694f7c914,e2cb5e6d-b1d1-57ec-a75b-a2fbf580feb1,d5f398bf-e4cb-5f49-8f24-c04bfe0103f8,36874d66-3992-5cb2-990f-e4227c439c08","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Fort Collins","Horsetooth Reservoir","Rotary Park","Waterway Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.15671,40.56769]},"bbox":[-105.15730193995311,40.56724033981815,-105.15611806004686,40.56813966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106535515","area_id":"NodNZjmSXLKZD+QifEOcCA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.15730193995311,40.56724033981815],[-105.15611806004686,40.56724033981815],[-105.15611806004686,40.56813966018186],[-105.15730193995311,40.56813966018186],[-105.15730193995311,40.56724033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:53.401Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:04.809Z"}
