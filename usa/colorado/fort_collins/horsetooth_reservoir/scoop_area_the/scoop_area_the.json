It is a stemming problem reminiscent of\n\nStem Gem\n\nat Joshua Tree.  If the power problems on the\n\nMental Block\n\nfrustrate you, then try The Scoop where technique and a clear head are more important.","protection":"Flat landing, pads.","location":"Actually, this is located pretty far north of Rotary Park. It's best to drive north from the Rotary parking area until you get to the Sunrise Day Use Parking (about 3/4 mile). Hike south from this parking area on an obvious trail that skirts along the clifftop. It heads down a hill, then back uphill through some pines. When you emerge from the pines, keep an eye out on your right for a rusty pipe sticking out of the rock. Scramble down a break in the cliff right after this pipe. At the base of the cliff, hike about 15 yards south and The Scoop will be the obvious, tan face.
