I kept driving by while working in Laramie and just had to climb it! It's a high quality right facing dihedral with one small easily surmountable roof. The crux is about 15' from the top of the climb (right at the small bunch grass growing in the crack). Easy start with a fun finish and you get to give the motorists a show. I found some info on this area in the Rock 'n' Road Atlas but otherwise there is very little info, if anyone can provide other route, FA or area information it would be greatly appreciated!","protection":"Trad route that protects well with small to medium gear. Great belay on the summit with an easy walk off on the backside (however you briefly cross private property, be respectful).","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,58343ac7-d09d-502d-80d2-8c6694f7c914,fef99d65-5f80-53df-b866-c7012dfbc600","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Fort Collins","Virginia Dale Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3528,40.9565]},"bbox":[-105.35339541279565,40.956050339818134,-105.35220458720437,40.95694966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106656246","area_id":"/vmdZV+AU9+4ZscBLfvGAA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:51.719Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:58.352Z"}
