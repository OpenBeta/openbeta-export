Most of the climbing is traditional with supplemental bolts as needed, and none of the routes are very long so a 60m rope will do just fine.\n\nTo get there, park at Elkhorn Creek Trailhead and walk the Lady Moon trail along the creek.  Pass through the meadow and by the old cabin, and shortly after begin to look up and right. A faint, cairned trail leads up to the East Face."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"+ds3oYZZRwyMTn/iqOrUTw==","historyId":"63a642bfeb34339e57e32cd6","prevHistoryId":"63a64294eb34339e57e32b9b","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"+ds3oYZZRwyMTn/iqOrUTw==","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-12-23T23:48:06.726Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:53:39.415Z","updatedBy":"+ds3oYZZRwyMTn/iqOrUTw=="}
