At over 8,000 ft, it provides excellent 3-season climbing with the ability and cherry pick some sunny days in the winter if the wind isnâ€™t too bad.  \n\nThe densest (and best) roped climbing is located at the Grazing Allotment Crag, which like many of the domes features both a shady and a sunny side.  A half-dozen or so more crags are detailed in the Red Feather Lakes Climbing Guide, with new development ongoing.\n\nThe bouldering in the area is perhaps the main attraction and way more extensive. The guidebook details over 500 problems.\n\n"},"density":0.6096931933230658,"totalClimbs":21,"__v":5,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:52.791Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:11:29.205Z","_change":{"user":"+ds3oYZZRwyMTn/iqOrUTw==","historyId":"63a63e2eeb34339e57e32734","prevHistoryId":"63a0a4ccd0dc2f1ac594004b","operation":"addArea","seq":0},"updatedBy":"+ds3oYZZRwyMTn/iqOrUTw=="}
