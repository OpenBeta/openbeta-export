Fun terrain takes you to another ledge with an overhang and an exciting but casual exit through large features. Be sure to extend the draw on the slab before the ledge as well as the draw in the roof. The line leads out right, and then a few face moves take you to a casual topout passing a recommended gear placement or two (a 0.75 and 1 are ample). This one goes all the way to the summit and a very comfortable belay ledge. Just keep going straight up. It is highly recommended to climb it in multi-pitch fashion, bringing up your second. This avoids drag if toproping, and offers the most fulfilling experience this wall has to offer. Sit back, and enjoy the view.\n\nYou’ll want a 70m rope. If you have a 60m, summit together, and either walk\n\neast down through the corridor, accessing the chain anchors for\n\nOverpopulation\n\nwhere a 60m rope will reach the ground, or\n\nwalk off the backside (descending an easy Class 4 chimney then walking west and back to Arthur’s Trail or descending through a deep runnel slot after passing the seasonal waterfall and\n\nBlack Dog\n\n, eventually back to the base of the wall).\n\nAll the bolts were funded and provided by The NCCC.
