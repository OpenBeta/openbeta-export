When/if you wander the Twelve Pack Wall's right side looking for a line to call out to you, you might just see this line and rack up.  It's not quite as hard as it looks, but the pro is small at the crux.\n\nTo the right of\n\nChunky Monkey\n\nby perhaps 40 feet, you will see a S-shaped line in a left-facing dihedral of a pair.  Start up in the double cracks with good body scums.  There is a slightly reachy (especially for those 5'4\") bit perhaps 25 feet up where you can scoot to the left crack if necessary.  That is probably the physical crux.  Then, you need to move right where the crack gets too small for pro or fingers.  You can get a #3 BD wire here before you reach out right for the arete hold.  That's a fun move and probably the mental crux.  Continue up the arete or dihedral to a ledge.  Finish off the line on slightly more licheny terrain.  There is an old small Friend stuck in a crack near the top.
