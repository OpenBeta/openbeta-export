Dave put up many of the routes on North Table Mountain back when it just looked like a choss pile. The crags don't look much better several years down the line, but a slew of fine climbing routes have arisen from the heap. Winter Warmer is certainly one of the best lines on the hill and a fine contribution on Dave's part.\n\nThe climbing begins below the tallest sector of the hill, and takes a bold stab up the headwall 65 feet above. Start in a flaring, inverted slot and make a big reach to killer jugs and the second clip. The bigger your ape index, the easier the move.  Winter Warmer steps left to follow a line of bolts up to the roof and head wall above. A variation to Winter Warmer stays straight on after the second clip and follows a thin seam for a short way. This is also a fine route, and it is also 80 - 85 feet long. Pull the roof on Winter Warmer on its left hand side and continue up a pumpy jug haul to the double bolt anchor that is over a ledge and out of sight.\n\nThree stars by any estimate for the nice long route, good climbing moves, boldness, and overall fine stone.","protection":"QDs only.

Negotiate a reachy jug haul to stand on micro feet below the black wall. A few tricky moves on the arete lead to a clip that almost provides a top rope for the crux. Suck in your breath after the crux, 5.12a, for a dicey run out to more jugs, another clip or two and the anchor. Electrocuticles gets two stars for for rock, the continuity, and the tricky moves.
