Immediately West of the large boulder that defines the beginning of this area is a short, wide, trad crack (presently shares its anchor with Alan's Seam) right of Alan's Seam. The seam fires up on cool moves half within and half outside of a shallow, left-angling seam. Gain a small roof with a Hands -+ crack on its left. Pull over the roof and into the crack for a brief but enjoyable crux, than chase some easy terrain to the anchor on the left-facing wall above.
