You can pretend you're on the last pitch of\n\nYellow Spur\n\n.... ;)\n\nBegin either with deep, vertical cracks right on the bulgy arete (brushy and awkward) or use big cracks and flakes on the right wall (inside the Jericho base area) to move up and \"around the corner\" onto the arete above the bushes. After that, you'll feel like a sweepstakes winner moving up the runout-but-solid arete above.

It certainly catches your eye as you climb on the Triangles or look up and left from lower Jericho. It looks a bit loose from a distance, but a mild cleaning gave up a bit of nice climbing. Mike Endicott suggested the line but was unable to be there for our first go.\n\nOn FA, we rapped in to avoid harming the rope with rock cleaning. We approached fairly similarly as for the main part of Jericho but aimed for a flattish, cap-like boulder above this corner. You can also traverse carefully from the top of Jericho on a grassy but exposed ledge.\n\nWe belayed off to the side with a #4 Camlot (old size) to the left, but small cams can work. Pulling up into the dihedral tempts one to step on the jutting flake on the right, but that'll go, so you can use a foothold just below to be safe. A short climber may find the start reachy. Continue up the dihedral and look left for pro. At times, the right wall will lure you. Near the top, the crux seems to involve trusting or not trusting a feldspar-rich hold (I didn't).\n\nBeware of the cactus up and right on the topout ledge.","protection":"The dihedral protects with mostly small cams, blue Alien to #0.75 Camalot and a #3 Camalot. A #4 Camalot to belay at the start is nice. The belay at the top can be a #0.5, #2, yellow and red Aliens with long slings.","location":"This is up and left of the Jericho buttress.
