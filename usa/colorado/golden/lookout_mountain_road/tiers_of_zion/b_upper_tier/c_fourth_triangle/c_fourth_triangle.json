The crux is between bolts 1 and 2- thin moves.\n\nTakin' it Slow (5.6)-- follows the shallow dihedral to the left for 25 feet, then breaks right up the face to join Takin' it Easy at the juggy terrain.

It would make a fine early lead for the aspiring tradster - there are many options for pro. The lower section is surprisingly steep, and the upper section flirts with exposure.\n\nP1. The lower face offers a range of variations, from 5.1-3 on the right (west) to 5.4-5 on the left. There is even a way to start by pulling onto a bit of a bulge/overhang in the middle (5.6?). All lines are characterized by deep jugs and odd huecos. Climb either to the 2-bolt anchor (above the most obvious line, on the left) or to the high point of the lower section, where you can sling the horn.\n\nP2. Engage the arete of the upper section. The easier start is on the west side, and the steeper, spicier start is on the arete itself. Follow the arete to the top, stepping out over the NE face as desired (cleaner climbing, nice exposure; you're climbing right above the face containing\n\nTakin' it Easy\n\n). Belay at the anchor bolts on the summit (shared anchor with\n\nTakin' it Easy\n\n).","protection":"Light trad rack-- small to medium-sized cams.
