Cut hard right just off the notch, and follow fun steps to a ledge below overhangs. Climb very steeply, with good pro, until you can step right onto a good stance below final overhang. Find as much pro as you can, step right again, pull the bulge, and mantel up to the top.

It seems fairly unique in Colorado in my wanderings. Done a long time ago based upon the ancient bolt on top. This is the obvious line, but there are others if you linger. From Panorama Point, continue on the dirt road to the Harmsen Ranch. Find this obvious spire on the hill behind the Ranch. Get a bearing. Hike up through a forest 20-25 minutes.\n\nThis is the path of least resistance:\n\nStart on what seemed to be the SW face. Follow a line of 3 bolts up a face (crux), angle right and curl around to the SE face up easy, broken rock, pass an ancient bolt, and find yourself on top.\n\nRap 80 feet from a fixed anchor. Because this anchor is basically centered on top, the rope pull can require a bit of a pull.\n\nPer\n\nGreg Barnes\n\n: with the new rap anchor going directly down the route on the southwest side, it's a 95' rap.\n\nYou can extend your day with a wander (bushwhack) left to the second buttress of Mt. Thoridin as we did that day.","protection":"We used a blue Alien, small wire, #2 Friend, another Alien, 3 QDs, 1 longer sling, and 50m rope.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b34b81ad-639b-5002-8b62-fcc081599499,5e6fc0bb-0f2e-5711-846b-779a3db06c9b,4797e074-2274-589d-9556-d251d31eaff5","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Golden","Golden Gate Canyon SP","[Redacted]"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.42313,39.87548]},"bbox":[-105.42371592257419,39.875030339818146,-105.42254407742578,39.875929660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745795","area_id":"R5fgdCJ0WJ2VVtJR0x6v9Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:04.926Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:17.903Z"}
