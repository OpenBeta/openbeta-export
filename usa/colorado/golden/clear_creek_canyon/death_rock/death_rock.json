All of the difficult climbing happens after clipping a bolt, so it's relatively safe.  There are a few loose looking handholds between the first and second bolts, so beware.  Stick clipping the second bolt may be a good idea.\n\nClimb the overhanging face for four bolts to reach a rest ledge.  Power up good holds for two more bolts and then solve the final roof moves to gain the anchors.\n\nThe rock on this route looks like it's brittle and crumbly, but it's actually pretty solid; however, the rest ledge has some loose rocks on it that end up on some of the holds directly below it.","protection":"6 bolts, there are lowering biners at the anchor.","location":"This is the middle of the three current routes at Death Rock.  It starts off of the large Death Rock Chockstone.  You can either tunnel under the Death Rock Chockstone or take a faint climber's trail around the left side of the wall until you are directly level with the climb."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b34b81ad-639b-5002-8b62-fcc081599499,8af5df63-9dd1-5fb2-9ef1-c3c3860494f5,84f2850c-bcf5-5d6e-818e-c0d0b0d684c3","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Golden","Clear Creek Canyon","Death Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.32088,39.73991]},"bbox":[-105.32146476831089,39.73946033981814,-105.32029523168912,39.74035966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109691925","area_id":"hPKFDLz1XW6BjsDQsNaEww=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:03.991Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:56.530Z"}
