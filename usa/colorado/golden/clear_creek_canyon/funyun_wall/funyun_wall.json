This allows you to clip before pulling the crux moves.\n\nStart up the shared start with \"\n\nFunyun Warm Up\n\n.\" After the 3rd bolt, break left on good underclings to a good stance below the crux. Enter the crux on slopers and sloping sidepulls (hopefully you hung a sling here), and throw to the huge jug. Recompose yourself, climb easier ground for a bolt or two, and enter the second crux. The higher clip in this crux is nice to have a double draw allowing you to clip high off good holds and skip the lower bolt.
