The most interesting feature and saving grace of this route is a tight lay-away after 20 ft that is accomplished with a nice series of technical switches in body position; better if you are short. Finishing this interesting sequence gains a stance on the left. The rest of the route climbs up some very slopey features on bullet proof stone.
