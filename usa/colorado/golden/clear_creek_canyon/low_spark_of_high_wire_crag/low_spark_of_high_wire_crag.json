The climb is about 70 feet long. The crack provides some nice jams. If you happen to be walking north along the west side of the river below High Wire, this ramp is likely the last easy way out if the river is too high. This would be a great beginner trad route if the approach wasn't so difficult.\n\nExit: after topping out, carefully scramble up to the base of High Wire over loose rock.\n\nGetting there: this climb is on the west side of the river about 300 feet south of the Tunnel 2 Bridge and begins at the river bottom.

The holds and pro are all there, but the question is if you can stay with it before the gas runs out.\n\nThis diagonal crack (left to right) faces north, is about 40 feet above the river, and can easily be seen from the bridge on the east side of Tunnel 2. Begin on the low angle arÃªte near the edge of Clear Creek.  Set an anchor for your belayer and climb over an easy shelf to the base of the crack.  30 feet of assorted finger, hand, and arm jams with a jug in between will get you to the top.\n\nThere is a large boulder on a grassy knoll about 15 feet above the top of the crack that can be slinged for an anchor, or there are some cracks available for the anchor 20 feet above the boulder.  Be sure to consider the traversing nature of this climb for protecting the follower when setting your pro and anchor.  Watch out for small pesky cacti at the top of the crack.\n\nDescent:  Head left (southwest) up the grassy knoll and 4th class up some easy rock to the base of High Wire Crag.
