The \"scary block\" is not all that scary and couldn't come out unless you go up there with a  crowbar, but since there is a reference to it in the guide I thought it should be mentioned.\n\nHead Like a Hole is quite a sustained route, with a very tricky clipping crux near the end of the cave section, followed by a slightly runout 12a/b finish on the face.
