The footholds are sparse, slick and never in the optimal location for the moves they support. Handholds are off-balance sidepulls and odd crack pod finger lock pockets. Most moves, from bottom to fluttery topout, feel insecure. From the first good topout holds, relax, breathe, and slowly climb around the blunt arete to the left. These moves are easier than the climb proper, but you're way off the ground, probably pumped and no longer over the pads. Downclimb the 5.7, broken corner to the left of the problem.\n\nThis problem would be a poor choice for a climber who sometimes sends 5.10s or has no head for highballs. A fall from higher moves, even onto pads, could have you in a cast or casts all summer. Be safe!","protection":"At least one pad, preferably three. A spotter or three might be nice, but who's got friends?","location":"From the parking at the downstream side of tunnel one, walk down the well-established approach trail till it meets the water's edge. On your right, at the first clean section of the cliff, is a section of face with discontinuous crack system holds vaguely describing a tall, somewhat scary problem.\n\nThe steep blunt arete to the left may go as a significantly harder problem.

The rock here is somewhat polished and the holds are small.  I think it is harder than 10c, but that is what it is rated in the newest guidebook.
