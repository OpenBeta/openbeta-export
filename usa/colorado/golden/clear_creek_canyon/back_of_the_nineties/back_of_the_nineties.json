As its name implies, Mission Vision provides unique and excellent views of the Mission Wall, and the climbing is very similar to the adventure style routes on that wall.\n\nThis is kind of the warm up. Start with a stem dihedral for a few clips.  Once on the mossy ledge, make high clip and continue up faint layback crack and some slopey holds to slab ledge underneath a pegmatite bulge (a tad spicy getting to this clip).  Crank over the bulge (crux) and continue up jugular climbing to a good perch at the left edge of the grassy ledge and rap station.  Lower about 90 feet to the ground OR continue up another couple of clips on well-featured and clean 5.8 climbing to the top of the Crag buttress.  From here, lower with 69 meter cord, or bring two ropes.  (NO, a 60 meter will not get you to the ground from this high point.)\n\nOne star for the long continuous climbing, the location and views.  Some of the dirty rock may detract from the quality but might clean up after several ascents, unless you strangley enjoy that \"adventurous feel\" like I do.","protection":"9 bolts to first set of anchors. 3 additional draws to top out on upper anchors. 1 belay bolt at the start.
