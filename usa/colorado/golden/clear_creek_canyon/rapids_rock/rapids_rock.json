Follow the approach for Highlander and New River Wall for about 100 yards. As the trail hits a small flat area and heads up left, look down and right to find an outcropping with 2 bolts at the lip and a third as backup about 10 feet from the lip.\n\nFigure out how to get down. I set up a rappel at the anchors with the single bolt as backup and rappelled about 50 feet down and right to the lower anchors (on a sloping shelf just off the water). Watch the ends of your rope or coil them and feed as you rappel to keep your rope dry! Another possibility would be to rappel off a separate line, setup to stay out of the river.\n\nFollow 3 bolts up and left over relatively easy terrain. Crank up and over a small roof (crux - 1 more bolt) and head for the anchors.","protection":"2 bolt anchor, 4 bolts, 2 bolt anchor.","location":"This is located on the far left side of the crag on the slabby area."},"__v":0},{"_id":"y5BhgRC1X6WhtuuhD5qLAA==","name":"B.F.F.F.","yds":"5.12b/c","grades":{"yds":"5.12b/c","french":"7b+"},"fa":"Jason Baker (10/08)","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.31775,39.73764]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106269847","mp_crag_id":"106253166","climb_id":"y5BhgRC1X6WhtuuhD5qLAA==","areaRef":"o2+UHoJMUA68D3Jo5MJqXA=="},"content":{"description":"This route begins at the far left end of the fixed line.
