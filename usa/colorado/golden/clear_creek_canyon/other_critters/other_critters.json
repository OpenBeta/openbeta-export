The new anchor will land you at the P2 anchors of Yellow Dog Dingo; finish with the regular Yellow Dog Dingo rappel route. You won't be able to see if there's anyone at the P2 anchors while you're on the summit so yell loudly before you throw your rope.\n\nNote that the placard signage by the last bolt of the route points to the old, still-existing, inconvenient trad-style anchor bolts on the summit block that you can't rap from, but can still use to bring up your follower. Alternately, you can walk off the top via the dirty, loose, thorn-filled gully to the west of the summit, between Safari and Live Action. The gully is not fun and has some exposed moves. Not recommended in poor weather but might be your best option if YDD is super crowded. Any pair of pitches can be combined.
