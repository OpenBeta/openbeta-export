With athletic, gym-style slaps between large slopers, prolific shade, and a trivial approach, this line has the potential to become the most popular 5.14 in Clear Creek Canyon.  The route lacks the fingery crimps or stopper cruxes of many of the canyon's other hard lines, making this a great choice for a first 5.14 project.  While the rock quality is not ideal, the line boasts sneaky good position, movement, and continuity--Clear Creek Power Endurance at its finest.\n\nBig jugs lead to a good ledge below the third bolt.
