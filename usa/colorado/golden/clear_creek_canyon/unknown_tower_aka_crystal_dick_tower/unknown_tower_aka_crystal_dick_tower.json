I mean he lived in Golden....\n\nWe opted to simul-rap off the tower (pretty cool rappel move to get off a tower).\n\nIn the photo, the red V indicates a good spot to simul-rap.","protection":"A single rack of widgets (not phone apps).","location":"This is right before/under Real Hidden Valley."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b34b81ad-639b-5002-8b62-fcc081599499,8af5df63-9dd1-5fb2-9ef1-c3c3860494f5,42319af5-600c-59c5-baae-72beae661055","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Golden","Clear Creek Canyon","Unknown Tower AKA Crystal Dick Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.34706,39.74255]},"bbox":[-105.34764479071357,39.742100339818144,-105.3464752092864,39.742999660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117135214","area_id":"QjGa9WAMWcW6rnK+rmYQVQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:03.031Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:54.282Z"}
