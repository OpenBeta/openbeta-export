Crouch start at right hand flake and left hand sidepull pinch. Move up to an obvious undercling flake and match. Then move right to a visibly enhanced sidepull before a massive dyno back left to a good edge and better holds above.\n\nThis boulder has a somewhat controversial history as it was dug out, glued, and chipped by parties who shall remain nameless. That said, it is one of the better hard problems on the Front Range featuring very powerful and interesting moves on good rock. The landing should be watched carefully owing to the backslapping potential on some of the moves.\n\nIt has a short approach, easy access, and is good in winter.","protection":"Several pads.","location":"About 10 minutes of gully scrambling will get you to the boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b34b81ad-639b-5002-8b62-fcc081599499,8af5df63-9dd1-5fb2-9ef1-c3c3860494f5,1de754f8-6d8a-5c18-b6ea-794fc033fbad,bedcdc93-8244-538a-bcf7-4fd59d49160b,f0f7b956-f879-59f6-abf6-641d375cd6ee","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Golden","Clear Creek Canyon","Clear Creek Canyon Bouldering","Bouldering (mile marker 268)","Echale Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V14"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.28489,39.74274]},"bbox":[-105.28547479232603,39.74229033981814,-105.28430520767401,39.743189660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108375979","area_id":"8Pe5Vvh5Wfar9mQdN1zW7g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.28547479232603,39.74229033981814],[-105.28430520767401,39.74229033981814],[-105.28430520767401,39.743189660181855],[-105.28547479232603,39.743189660181855],[-105.28547479232603,39.74229033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:04.917Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:19.648Z"}
