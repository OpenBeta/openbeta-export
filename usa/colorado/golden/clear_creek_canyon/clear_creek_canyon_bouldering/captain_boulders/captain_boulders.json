Move up through increasingly difficult terrain with perfect flow to a committing crux move at 20 feet. There are several different methods to do this crux, and all are hard and scary. After the hardest move, continue into the no fall zone using perfectly sculpted holds on the arete and the crack systems on the face. Rock over the lip using a jug block, and stand on the slab.
