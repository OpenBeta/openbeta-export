Crasters’ Keep is a beautiful highball arete located across the way from\n\nMoss Man\n\n.\n\nBegin sitting on a hollow but solid crimpy flake. Move up into crimps and eventually fingerlock underclings that lead to a few deadpoints through positive slopers. Move up to a decent crimp rail over the bulge, and find some high feet to make a committing move (crux) to a flat jug near the top. Pull over the exposed lip with caution.\n\nThis thing has a similar style and movement to nearby\n\nDiamondback\n\nbut is just easier and a little more committing. Crasters’ Keep deserves to be a popular boulder and is a unique one for CCC!","protection":"3 pads and a spotter so you don’t fly over the pedestal.","location":"Located directly under the large roof on the left (upriver) side of Creekside known as\n\nBrennivin\n\nRoof, this funny looking boulder sticks out of the ground and has a beautiful, striking arete on the right.
