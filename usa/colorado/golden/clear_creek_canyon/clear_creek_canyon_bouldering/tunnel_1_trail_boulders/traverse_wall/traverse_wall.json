From across the creek, I spotted a few buildering traverses that were being built by the kind masons on the Peaks to Plains Trail project. I never could have imagined that they would be building a masterpiece such as this right under my nose. \"Are We There Yet?\" is a 300+ foot traverse that goes at about 5.7 while avoiding the top layer of rock. This thing is beautiful! It's just technical enough to get a small pump going. It's a bit dirty and could use a good brushing. In its current state, it took us about 25 minutes to climb from one end to the other brushing small rocks and dirt off of the holds. This thing could be linked over and over and made as hard or as easy as you want. Get after it.","protection":"","location":"Park in the brand new parking lot right before Tunnel 1, walk down the ramp, and be amazed."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b34b81ad-639b-5002-8b62-fcc081599499,8af5df63-9dd1-5fb2-9ef1-c3c3860494f5,1de754f8-6d8a-5c18-b6ea-794fc033fbad,6cd01780-bed5-58dd-8a9a-eab2800ee7c6,5907c6a0-9add-5a22-935c-906389944f8e","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Golden","Clear Creek Canyon","Clear Creek Canyon Bouldering","Tunnel 1 Trail Boulders","Traverse Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.25123,39.74857]},"bbox":[-105.25181484180959,39.74812033981814,-105.25064515819042,39.74901966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121457717","area_id":"WQfGoJrdWiKTXJBjiZRPjg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:04.428Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:57.280Z"}
