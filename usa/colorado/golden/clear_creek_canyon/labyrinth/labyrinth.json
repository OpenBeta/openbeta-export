The start is right in line with a small bush almost blocking your access to the start just up from the small grove of aspens. The crux is probably the finishing move at the top although it never gets too hard. Still it is in need of some cleaning.","protection":"Standard rack for trad. If you are toproping, there is a sling with an ACR around a car-sized boulder at the top. This anchor can be used for a couple different lines in this wall. It's accessed easiest by taking the natural weakness to the right of this line up the small gully between the walls.","location":"This is the fourth obvious route from the right side.
