Although short, stellar rock, sustained difficulty, and a dizzying position make this a contender for the best arête climb in the canyon.  Complete with heel hooks, rock-overs, arête pinches and slaps, this burly beast will satisfy even the most discerning arête connoisseurs.\n\nStick clip the first bolt, then start from an exposed ledge just below the corner.  Sequential slaps between sidepull edges work past the first bolt to an awkward shake on the north face.  Clip up, then continue slapping along a quartz-studded rail, culminating in a big drive-by move just below the 4th bolt.  A strenuous clip precedes the crux—a tenuous mantel and long throw to the lip of the teetering tower.","protection":"4 bolts to 2BA.

The airy position and huge holds make this a highly entertaining climb, despite its short length, and the perfect warm-up for the crag’s other lines.\n\nBegin with fingery, vertical, face climbing along intricate dinner plates.  The crux comes in this section, with some 1-pad crimps and a long reach from an undercling to reach the juggy upper half. After a good shake, veer left towards the arête, where massive jugs work along the northeast edge of the precipitous upper wall.","protection":"5 bolts to 2BA.

Peacock offers engaging moves while they last, but the holds veer right (or really, straight up) to intersect the trivial, low-angle south edge of the wall, making for a disappointingly brief line that effectively ends at the third bolt. A directissima — avoiding the right edge — would be excellent and hard, though hopelessly contrived and arbitrary. Still, as it stands, this line is a fun, roped boulder problem on great rock in a spectacular setting.\n\nA few easier moves lead off the ground to a long crank to the obvious, horizontal seam. Match, then bear-hug up opposing sidepull rails that end at a long, crux throw to a crystal horn. Bigger holds appear as you near the slanted lip.
