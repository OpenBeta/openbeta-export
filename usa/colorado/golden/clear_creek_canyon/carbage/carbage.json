I listed the rating in the guidebook, but I think it is more difficult, maybe 11b/c. The crux at the big overhang is only a few moves but is not easy. It is not exactly a mantel as described in the guidebook. The feet are poor, and small hands are found above the overhang. Up higher, the climbing is easier, and the rock is not great but not that bad. I cleaned off some loose rock, and if more climbers do this in the future, it will get better.
