The rock in the dihedral is brilliant, the moves are fun throughout and quite exposed at the top, and the continuity of the climbing makes the line feel much longer than it is.\n\nBegin from the sloping ledge below the obvious, left-facing corner system just left of center. A dynamic boulder problem of gastons, sidepulls, underclings, and micro-footholds guards the vertical dihedral section. A few moderate moves lead to a strenuous stance below the immaculate upper corner. Exit the corner with a mind-bending sequence to reach Lonely Island Ledge just below the teetering cap rock.

The line is a bit silly and perhaps contrived, but if you can ignore those detractions, the climbing is rather fun and provides a really nice jug haul warmup with great exposure.\n\nStick clip at least the first bolt, then creep out the exposed ledge to the southern tip of the fin. A short boulder problem of hand jams, finger locks, and barn-door liebacking leads to good jugs near the second bolt. Rail traverse along the southern arête, surmounting an obvious, vertical step with more liebacking on big jugs.

Above, the climbing eases to elegant, 5.12, technical face climbing capped by a steep, gymnastic finish. The rock is brilliant (even the pegmatite intrusions are solid and clean), and the movement is stellar. Unfortunately a few uncomfortably sharp grips in the intro and inconsistent difficulty detract from an otherwise classic experience.\n\nBegin below a marble-like patch of pegmatite in the center of the east face. Burly, and at times painful, dynamic edging leads to a good clipping stance at a 1-pad flat edge just below the second bolt.

As it is, its enthralling and classic on killer stone, while it lasts.  Unlike its neighbors, this is a steep slab, but the holds are generally quite large and well-spaced, resulting in big, balancy moves that will keep your attention throughout.\n\nBegin by scrambling up to a dirt ledge on the northernmost end of the east face.   Deep, flat edges lead left onto the slab. Mantel onto the discontinuous ledge, and then lie-back up the left-leaning, left-facing corner.
