It is the most roof-like feature here."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b34b81ad-639b-5002-8b62-fcc081599499,8af5df63-9dd1-5fb2-9ef1-c3c3860494f5,ced06cf9-fb48-5983-a99c-a461134ed2fb","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Golden","Clear Creek Canyon","Live Action Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":3,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":5,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":3,"label":"5.8"},{"count":3,"label":"5.9"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c/d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":24,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":9,"advanced":12,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":9,"advanced":12,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.40955,39.74242]},"bbox":[-105.41013478961035,39.741970339818145,-105.40896521038965,39.74286966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111865927","area_id":"ztBs+ftIWYOpnKRhE07S+w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":24,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:57:03.397Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:15.047Z"}
