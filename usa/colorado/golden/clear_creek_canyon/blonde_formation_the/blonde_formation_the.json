Although the guidebook says 7 bolts for this route, I came across only 6. The scramble to the base of the route includes a lot of loose rock and a 4th Class section onto the actual rock, this is a bad place for your belayer to be if you fall, so perhaps try to belay from the ground somehow, may be difficult. The first bolt is a little ways up so be careful. This route I give 1 star if it were a little cleaner, as it was covered with a layer of sand/lichen when I climbed it, don't think it sees much action. The holds are fairly big, but nice and slopey.... Have fun, and bringing a brush is recommended.

The routes in general are avoided because of the proximity to the road, very close. This route is fairly straightforward but the grade is heightened a little bit due to the lichen covered rock, don't blindy throw for something that looks good on this crag, will be covered for sure.. I would give this route more stars if it weren't so close to the traffic. Watch when approaching the base of this route for rocks rolling onto the road.
