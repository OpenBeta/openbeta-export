The best that can be said about the final 30 feet is that it packs in a lot of variety, but if you deviate at all from the bolt line, expect to find some questionable rock.\n\nBegin easily up the magnificent arête, which culminates in a long, balancy reach to a narrow ledge on the left face. Mantel onto the ledge for a good shake below the obvious roof. Sequential cranks around the ceiling gain a no-hands ledge followed by a stretch of easy scrambling to the first of two successive bulges (optional 0 or 00 TCU here). Save something for the second bulge, just below the anchor, which is just hard enough to spoil a send.","protection":"A stick clip is mandatory. 7 bolts to 2 BA.

Above the roof, a short, easy slab gains the anchor.\n\nThe crux start can presumably be avoided by following the crack on the left, though it’s debatable how much easier, if it all, this variant would be. There is no question the highest quality option is to climb directly, staying entirely right of the crack and using the sloper rail system for the left hand.

Relatively easier moves lead to the next break and a taxing rest before the route’s crux — a long reach past the third bolt. This problem can be surmounted with power or guile (or perhaps a huge wingspan), depending on your skillset. Another short boulder problem leads to a small roof capped by a blank headwall.
