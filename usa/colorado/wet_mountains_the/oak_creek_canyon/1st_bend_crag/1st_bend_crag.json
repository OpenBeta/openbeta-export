The crack ends, then face climb past 1 more bolt and to the anchors.  The crux is in the bolted line, but if you're new to the crack game, the undercling/layback section might feel harder.  I first climbed this 4 years ago and remember there being ball bearings in the crack section, and last spring I got on it again and it had cleaned up nicely.","protection":"Draws, nuts, and single rack of cams from #0.3 to #3 Camalots, doubles in fingers are optional.
