Approach via the Stevens Gulch trail, and split off north just after climbing up to the upper basin below Torreys Peak.  Hike directly to the saddle between Torreys and Kelso Mountain to gain the ridge at a small adit (mine).\n\nClimb directly up the ridge, following a trail winding around spires.  Occasional 4th class sections provide the challenge.  The final crux lies about 200' below the summit, and consists of a slabby traverse on slick rock.  Srcamble the final stretch past the topout of Dead Dog Couloir to the summit.  Descend to the Grays-Torreys saddle and pick up the trail back to your car.\n\nFor a true alpine feel, try it in winter or spring conditions.","protection":"Some nuts might work in places.  The rock is pretty crumbly so passive pro is best.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,ca62e37c-9788-5ea8-852c-50e3cb16110e","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Torrey's Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.821,39.6428]},"bbox":[-105.82158394629981,39.64235033981815,-105.82041605370019,39.643249660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745960","area_id":"ymLjfJeIXqiFLFDjyxYRDg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.82158394629981,39.64235033981815],[-105.82041605370019,39.64235033981815],[-105.82041605370019,39.643249660181866],[-105.82158394629981,39.643249660181866],[-105.82158394629981,39.64235033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:44.911Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:33.577Z"}
