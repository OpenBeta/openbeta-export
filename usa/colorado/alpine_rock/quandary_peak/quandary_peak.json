Begin in an inset, slightly left-trending, 15 foot wide constriction to the west of the entrance of the Cristo. Climb easy snow to the base of the constriction, where there may be a nice snow ledge/crevasse on the right side that makes a good place to set up. Continuing up the couloir earns you 60-65 degree snow for about 400 feet or so before spitting you out into the snow slopes above, at which point you should continue up for roughly 600 feet before traversing right on solid rock until you reach the Cristo, where you may join the line of people trudging slowly up for the last 1/3rd of the couloir.\n\nThis was named after Brigadier General Andrew Armacost, Dean of Faculty at the US Air Force Academy.","protection":"None is needed, though you could potentially place gear in the walls of the couloir if you felt uncomfortable soloing.","location":"Follow the approach to the base of the Cristo Couloir, but instead of heading up it at the first chance, keep walking until you can see this obvious line to its left.
