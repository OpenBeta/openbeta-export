Drop down to a notch at 12,100' (a few 4th class moves). Climb out of the notch, and cross over to the west side of the ridge, skirting below the top layer of crags. Keep traversing at about 12,300' around grassy scree bowls on the west side, a hundred to two hundred feet below the ridge crest, bypassing Point 12,462'. Finally come to a vertical dropoff about 150' below the ridgeline. Take a rubbly horizontal break left (east) towards a notch at 12,500'. The break is exposed and with some loose rocks, but for the most part, there are solid holds available (exposed 3rd class). The horizontal break will deposit you about 50' below the 12,500' notch.\n\nHead up the clean rock scoop to the base of Paiuteâ€™s north-facing, triangular headwall. Traverse right to the skyline (3rd class). Immediately around the corner to the south is a shallow alcove with a short, southwest-facing dihedral to the left. Take the dihedral (5.5), then follow clean flakes to easier ground to the summit.\n\nFrom the top of the rock scoop, it's also possible to traverse left and bypass the headwall on that side. We didn't go that way, but according to others who've done so, this is only 3rd Class.","protection":"None required.","location":"From Buchanan Pass, hike south past Sawtooth Mountain to the summit of Algonquin."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,5f78c46b-a25c-5b59-8514-41ae795c0b82,44318768-2a2a-5820-bc31-d31caeca78bf","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Indian Peaks","Paiute Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.63304,40.09809]},"bbox":[-105.63362783498455,40.097640339818135,-105.63245216501544,40.098539660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106454047","area_id":"RDGHaCoqWCC8MdMcrsp4vw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:03.478Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:51.125Z"}
