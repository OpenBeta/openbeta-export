The technical portion of the route is about a mile long and involves third and fourth class scrambling. If heading East to West, the crux of the route is either the downclimb off Little Pawnee or the downclimb from one of the rock pinnacles soon thereafter. These sections might be easier in reverse but might make the route more difficult overall due to the fact that you would be losing instead of gaining elevation. It is sometimes possible to bypass the high points on the ridge by climbing on easier terrain to either side - there is lots of opportunities to spice this dish up or keep it mild depending on your palate.\n\nThere are several opportunities to bail off the ridge to the North or South.","protection":"There is a fair amount of loose rock on this ridge, but it is possible to protect this with slings and an alpine rack. The author did not protect the route, and so information is incomplete.","location":"Begin at the Long Lake Trailhead (40째04'41.3\"N 105째35'02.3\"W). If climbing the ridge East to West, leave the Pawnee Pass trail just East of Lake Isabelle, and head North and uphill to gain the small peak at 40.078906, -105.613649. Continue West along the ridgeline, and reach the next high point which is Little Pawnee Peak. Continue to follow the ridge with third and fourth class scrambling, and make a final uphill, non-technical push to the top of Pawnee Peak. Drop down South onto the saddle, and follow Pawnee Pass Trail back to the trailhead.\n\nClimb the ridge in reverse by following Pawnee Pass Trail all the way to the saddle. Gain Pawnee Peak, and head down its East side to begin the ridge climb."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,5f78c46b-a25c-5b59-8514-41ae795c0b82,59536734-e6e0-5c6c-ad65-36cde299906f","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Indian Peaks","Pawnee Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.6326,40.08141]},"bbox":[-105.63318769094879,40.08096033981814,-105.63201230905123,40.08185966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120283600","area_id":"WVNnNObgXGytZTbN4pmQbw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:03.478Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:38.592Z"}
