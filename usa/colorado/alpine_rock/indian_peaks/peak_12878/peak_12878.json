It looks 50 feet tall from far away. It is less impressive closer up. You can climb up the west side or the east side from the south. This is rated R. The protection is not the most solid, and the whole thing vibrates in the wind!","protection":"There is a nice flake along the west side. It feels solid but sounds hollow. I stuck a medium cam behind it, and it felt solid, but I am not sure what would have happened if I fell on it. Also, I placed a medium stopper or two if I recall correctly. There are no trustworthy gear placements on the top of the tiny summit.","location":"The easiest way to find it is to traverse south from Pawnee Pass around the east side of the summit of Peak 12,878 to the notch between it and Shoshoni Peak. From the notch, the pinnacle can easily be seen to the north. Or, you can traverse south from Pawnee Pass right over the summit of Peak 12,878."},"__v":0},{"_id":"GBj/NjTXVmeEwuArus5Zmw==","name":"Unknown Pinnacle","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"2015?
