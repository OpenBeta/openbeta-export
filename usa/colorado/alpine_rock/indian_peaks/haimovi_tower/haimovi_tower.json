Neglected, clearly, due to the grueling approach.  Many feet (~550)of elevation are lost near the end of the approach, 6 miles or so from the car (~5000 vert total).  Follow the Roaring Fork Trail (located on the far side of Lake Granby) up, down, across, back up over and down to Stone Lake.  Just before getting to Stone Lake, cut across a lush meadow and start up the obvious talus gully at the bottom of the tower.  Amble past the large chockstones over slippery rock near the top of this gully.  This plops you at the bottom of a fine wall.  We did 5 longish pitches on bomber rock taking a fairly direct line up the series of three buttresses.  For comfort, it seemed you should feel comfy leading 5.7, although much easier lines are wanderable no doubt.  Trickier lines may also be confronted with smirks.  Follow your nose to obtain the best fun for you.\n\nP1. Atop the grassy ramp, follow nice corners and then wander left up through a dish (200' plus some soloing).\n\nP2. Cross the ledge, then climb the glorious ramp to some cracks and on to a ledge (200').  You could also climb the white dihedral here, looks fun, if you have gear.\n\nP3. Cimb a series of two cracks for a rope length.  After the first crack- step right 15' into a second (200').\n\nP4. Step up a slab and climb a widish crack for a bit to a ledge (150').\n\nP5-8. climb the obvious fist crack (100'), or head left to a cool traverse on knobs across a big block to a splitter, then up through steep 5.8 cracks to the summit (225').\n\nMANY variations are possible.  Gerry Roach has a good description and photo in his Indian Peaks Guidebook.","protection":"Depends how hard you want to climb.  There are 5.8-5.9 variations possible, so bring some cams, otherwise at 5.7- a #1, #2, and a light set of nuts should do.  Note:  for this rack, feel comfy runnin' it out.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"x6uBKeiqVoalHHlLE++XAQ==","name":"Ladybug Direct","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Rachel Saggau & Aaron Henriquez","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.696,40.1584]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"113266311","mp_crag_id":"105746403","climb_id":"x6uBKeiqVoalHHlLE++XAQ==","areaRef":"FPxB4v+7WuWw4/q0osRbpw=="},"content":{"description":"This is a more direct variation to the start pitch 3 of\n\nSoutheast Buttress\n\n.\n\nP1. From the base of the buttress, climb a left-angling crack to a ledge. Traverse left to base of finger crack, and build an anchor, 5.10 (likely goes free at .10/10+).\n\nP2. Climb left-angling finger crack approximately 15 feet up to place gear, then traverse 15 feet left on face holds. Then climb up good holds, and begin to climb up and right towards the main crack. Use thin finger pocket to reach for top of crack (the crux) with little to no gear (a 5.9 R/X rated move). Top out, and finish the regular route of\n\nSoutheast Buttress\n\n.\n\nNote: this is still a very uncleaned line. Light choss and loose rock are still very prevalent. A bolt or two on pitch 2 would make the climb a lot more fun and much safer.","protection":"P1: hand-sized gear.
