This gully is not pleasant after the snow melts out, but the best footing is to the right side on grassy or rocky areas.  Follow the ridge west over a few false summits to the summit of Elk Tooth.  One false summit even contains a false summit register!  The actual summit of Elk Tooth is stunning, as it sits above a steep cliff on the south face.  The real joy in this route, however, is that you can continue on to Ogalalla Peak.  See the East Ridge of Ogalalla Peak for details.","protection":"None","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,5f78c46b-a25c-5b59-8514-41ae795c0b82,20c4f539-d579-586d-9a37-56b5b58ea9a2","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Indian Peaks","Elk Tooth"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.655,40.1677]},"bbox":[-105.65558843738515,40.16725033981814,-105.65441156261487,40.16814966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746811","area_id":"IMT1OdV5WG2aN1a1tY6pog==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.65558843738515,40.16725033981814],[-105.65441156261487,40.16725033981814],[-105.65441156261487,40.16814966018187],[-105.65558843738515,40.16814966018187],[-105.65558843738515,40.16725033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:03.482Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:58.253Z"}
