Look for a large roof above grassy slopes. Bypass the roof on grassy ledges to the left, and the scrambling begins. The section just above the roof felt the hardest on less featured rock. Then the ridge narrows and climbing gets easier with more options. About 2/3 up, we came upon a notch with more difficult climbing above and to the right. At the notch, we traversed left of the ridge and regained the ridge soon after. The climbing remained sustained on featured Crestone conglomerate rock in the 4th Class range, maybe with a few moves of low 5th here and there, but we didn't look for the easiest passage. We were comfortable in approach shoes.\n\nDescent: we descended South slopes (Class 2), but there's North gully descent, as well as SW ridge descent options as well.","protection":"Natural pro.","location":"The route begins at 12,400 feet, just east and North of Cottonwood Lake. Look for an obvious large roof below a prominent rock rib to the left of a deeply inset gully (which can still hold snow late in the summer)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,66a3ae24-a3fa-5709-bb00-db44d8efc320,3e08016f-37f9-56d3-a78b-93d2db0739a1","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Sangre de Cristo Range","Crestolita"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.57564,37.9549]},"bbox":[-105.57621027642726,37.95445033981814,-105.57506972357274,37.95534966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117791659","area_id":"PggBbzf5VtOni5PS2wc5oQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:53.761Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:36.346Z"}
