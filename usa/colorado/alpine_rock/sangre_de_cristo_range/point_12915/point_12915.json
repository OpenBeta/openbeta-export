The crack is very obvious from the trail heading towards Mt. Lindsey. It would be a classic if it was more accessible.\n\nPitch 1 - 5.7 (55m)\n\nStart on a slab at the bottom of the crack until you reach a large ledge (~15m). Move left, and continue up the crack system using jams, stems, jugs, and some mild offwidth until you reach a big sketchy block resting on the top of a corner feature. Traverse out and left on the corner to get around the block, then move back in to the crack system and up to a small bulge. Pull the bulge, and continue up the low angle offwidth (5.2) with positive face holds until you reach a comfortable belay ledge on the right.\n\nPitch 2 - 5.7 (35m)\n\nMove back into the wide crack system and up to 2 small bulges. It's a lot easier than it looks. Continue up another low-angled, wide crack section to a shallow, chimney-like feature with hollow sounding rock. Climb the solid face to the right on hero jugs, then move back into the chimney above the junk. Another 15 feet from here gets you to the top.\n\nDescent\n\nRappelling: you can reach the ground with 2 rappels using 2 60m ropes. There are fixed pieces at the end of pitch 1 and 2 with rap rings.\n\nWalkoff: there's supposedly a Class 2+ gully on the northwest end of the mountain.","protection":"A standard rack and a #4 is plenty. Maybe 2 #4s or a #5 if you don't want to run it out on low-angle slab/wide crack (5.2).\n\nDouble 60s for the rappels.","location":"Hike up the trail that takes you to the summit of Mt. Lindsey (from Lily Lake trailhead). Once you get near tree line (~1.8 miles), find the obvious, huge crack that splits the buttress on your left."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,66a3ae24-a3fa-5709-bb00-db44d8efc320,43918d8b-8657-596d-8ea1-db5c96f53ffc","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Sangre de Cristo Range","Point 12,915"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.46215,37.59852]},"bbox":[-105.4627175339077,37.59807033981814,-105.46158246609228,37.59896966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120918025","area_id":"Q5GNi4ZXWW2OodtclvU//A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.4627175339077,37.59807033981814],[-105.46158246609228,37.59807033981814],[-105.46158246609228,37.59896966018187],[-105.4627175339077,37.59896966018187],[-105.4627175339077,37.59807033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:53.221Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:43.793Z"}
