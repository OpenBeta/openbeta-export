They look like they could just break off in your hand, but when you grab them they are very solid.\n\nAscend up to the base of The Prow on 3rd class terrain.  The climb starts with a hard to protect, 5.8 move up a bulge with a few loose blocks.  After that, the route finding and climbing is easy - just stay on the Prow.  The remainder of the climbing never exceeds 5.6.  However, you are climbing on the conglomerate knobs that sometimes break off.  There are a few false summits along the way.  Eventually, you will arrive at a large ledge that will allow you to ascend Challenger Point (to the west) or Kit Carson (to the east by 3rd class climbing).  The best option is to continue straight up for another low 5th class pitch to the summit of Kit Carson.\n\nKeep in mind that protection can be hard to find.\n\nFor the descent, head east for about a mile (climbing over another peak) to a broad valley (lowpoint between Kit Carson and Ellingwood) that will allow you to return back to your camp.

I went too far right and ended up on some of the scariest 5.11 unprotected face climbing I've ever seen. 60' run-out on sloping holds with 1000 feet of air below you = not too fun (unless you are sick in the head).\n\nThe rest of the pitches follow the ridge to the summit, mostly 5.6 to 5.7 moves all the way. The rock is solid and the exposure is real. Towards the top the climbing eases off to a 4th class, knife edge ridge and meets with the trail to Challenger Point.

As with all alpine climbs, be prepared for bad weather, start early, and expect tricky route-finding.\n\nFrom the summit of Crestone Peak, descend to the saddle where the Northwest and South gullies meet at the ridge crest. Descend the South gully for approximately 500 feet, and find a path of small cairns leading left (~ Southeast?) across a series of grassy benches.  You can also exit the South Gully up higher, adding more difficult, but still fun terrain to your climb.\n\nTraverse towards a prominent gully directly beneath the upper difficulties of Crestone Needle. When you reach the gully, ascend it on broken Class 3 terrain. Near the top, you will see a prominent tower known as the Black Gendarme. Cut hard right about 100 feet from the ridge crest and ascend a shallow dihedral/face system (difficult Class 3).\n\nAt this point, you can choose to climb a Class 3 face or go through a natural slot and traverse an airy ledge system. Both are fun and meet up in a wide class 3 gully with cool rock towers. Ascend this gully and make another slabby traverse under the intimidating summit pitch of Crestone Needle.
