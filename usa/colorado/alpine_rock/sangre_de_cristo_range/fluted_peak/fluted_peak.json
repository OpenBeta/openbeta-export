After climbing past these 2 rock/ice bands, the crux is encountered.  Either climb a short 30-40 foot AI3 pitch or a 100 foot mixed chimney (M2/5.3) on the right.  The climb continues as a moderate snow climb until nearing the top.  If a cornice blocks further progress in the main couloir, take a hidden left spur couloir ~100 feet below the ridge.\n\nThe top of the left spur becomes a steep snow climb.  From the ridge, hike 3 minutes to the summit.\n\nThe best descent is to either climb up and over Little Horn Peak or descend Flute's north ridge to the Fluted-Horn saddle and then back to Dry Lakes.","protection":"A limited rack with a few cams/stoppers and 2 ice screws.","location":"The route is located in the center of Fluted's East Face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,66a3ae24-a3fa-5709-bb00-db44d8efc320,b1e28c48-4cfa-581d-82ec-d0ac6b4d01b9","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Sangre de Cristo Range","Fluted Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.6569,40.2565]},"bbox":[-105.65748920891316,40.256050339818145,-105.6563107910868,40.25694966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107618562","area_id":"seKMSEz6WB2C7NCsa00BuQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:53.751Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:24.316Z"}
