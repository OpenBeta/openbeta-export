Scramble up the ridge. At some point, 12,300ish, most spiral around right/west to avoid a big notch. Or continue up to the notch, and enjoy the vantage point. Either rappel 80ish feet, or downscramble right/west and find the key ledge that takes one to the notch saddle. The final headwall ahead is easier than it looks.\n\nThe easiest class 2 descent is west to the saddle and back north to rejoin the approach.\n\nIf heading East to other peaks, the descent options start to suck. Continuing on to Eagle and Ribbed is a lot of fun, though you need good weather. In general, stay proper or bypass on grassy ledges south. This is perhaps 5.0 using alpine sense. Out and back Ribbed, we descended a crappy talus gully from just north of Eagle to Mystic Island Lake. This really sucked.","protection":"A light alpine rack if desired and a rope for an optional rappel.","location":"Cross the upstream entrance to Lake Charles. Locate a treeless gully due south. A social trail avoids much bushwhacking. Once above the initial cliffs, venture southwest to the base of the ridge."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,9738f49b-2eb2-528d-adde-3bf295553a95,b7841bb4-3529-55f0-adf8-278adb264c91","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Holy Cross Wilderness","Fool's Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.59967,39.45106]},"bbox":[-106.6002523349386,39.45061033981814,-106.5990876650614,39.451509660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112463302","area_id":"t4QbtDUpVfCt+CeK2yZMkQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:03.477Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:38.562Z"}
