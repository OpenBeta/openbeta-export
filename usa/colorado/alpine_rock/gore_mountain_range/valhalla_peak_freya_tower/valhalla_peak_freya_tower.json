However, it felt like a first ascent to us, as we were climbing up and up hoping we wouldn't get turned around and have to rappel down.\n\nOn September 10, 2016, Ryan Marsters, Mike Santoro, & I climbed the east ridge of Freya Tower followed by a climb up Stan Wagon's 5.6 route on Thor Tower.\n\nScramble around to the base of the east ridge from Asgard Meadows. Scramble maybe 50' (4th/ low 5th class) to a decent ledge at the base of a large slab into a southeast-facing dihedral. Belay from here for pitch 1. Note we climbed this route in approach shoes.\n\nPitch 1: climb up the steep slab on the dihedral's right side making some tricky leftward traversing moves at the top to get into the base of the vertical crux section of the dihedral (5.8). Climb the well-defined crack for 10' to a nice 3' wide grassy belay ledge. Belay here for pitch 2.\n\nPitch 2: climb up the right-trending crack and around the corner (5.8), running it out on easier terrain to a belay ledge.\n\nPitch 3: chimney up between a large headwall to the west and a smaller slab tower to its east. Then, climb the east-facing headwall (a 5.8 move maybe on the flat face) to a belay ledge at the top. Scramble down 10' to the west from the small belay ledge to a small col and then on up to the base of pitch 4.\n\nPitch 4: climb the nice, slightly overhanging hand crack (5.8) for 40' to a belay ledge. Scramble to the small, exposed summit of Freya.\n\nDescent: scramble exposed 4th/low 5th class down Freya's standard west ridge to the Freya-Thor saddle and then down to Asgard Meadows.","protection":"An alpine rack (BD C4 cams up to #2, a few Aliens, and a set of nuts).","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,ab307fe3-1f74-53e6-813a-e361b133b0f5,ba5e91fb-5ecf-5bd1-a06b-dcd8d4c09cb8","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Gore Mountain Range","Valhalla Peak, Freya Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.20569,39.66602]},"bbox":[-106.20627414248821,39.66557033981814,-106.2051058575118,39.66646966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112221941","area_id":"ul6R+17PW9Gga9zY1MCcuA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:54.450Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:25.121Z"}
