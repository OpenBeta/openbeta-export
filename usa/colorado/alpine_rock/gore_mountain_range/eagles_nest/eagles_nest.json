As is usual in the Gore, there are bypasses available on the West side.\n\nThe crux is near the saddle - a slabby start to right facing dihedral just off the West side of the ridge. It is airy 5.3/5.4 or so for 40 feet. Go EN->Powell to upclimb.\n\nThe traverse can be completed via lower West side ledges at Class 3/4.\n\nDescend Powell via the South slopes (class 2) to Kneeknocker Pass (regain required), the South ridge (scramble), or via the South slopes and then cutting over the South Ridge (Class 3 briefly).","protection":"Small alpine rack.
