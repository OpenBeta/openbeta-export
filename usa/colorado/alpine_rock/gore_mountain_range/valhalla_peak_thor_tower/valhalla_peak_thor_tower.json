I spied this line 2 years ago and came back to climb it. It has relatively low objective hazard (rockfall) and nice solid granite for the most part. The 1st pitch likely goes at 5.9 with the crux being some layback, finger climbing before our belay. The 2nd pitch is likely 5.10a/b with crux being first 25' off our belay in some tricky corner stemming and laybacking with not great gear. A nut seemed to protect the crux moves. My trip report is\n\nBook of Thor\n\n.\n\nThe descent is via Stan Wagon's original north-facing ascent/descent route.","protection":"No bolts/anchor; use cams with a few doubles, a set of nuts, and plenty of slings.","location":"This route is on the south face of Thor Tower and is distinguished by the obvious, large, right-facing dihedral with solid rock that is a bit \"pink\" in color.
