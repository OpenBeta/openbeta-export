The route was climbed in early fall (September) on alpine ice and rock and includes a long chimney pitch where the couloir funnels down mid-face (5.8). The exit we used was the highest, right-trending ramp that provided the steepest ice on the route. This ramp exits onto the summit ridge just below the top of the peak.","protection":"A small (single-set) rock rack plus a half-dozen ice screws provided excellent protection.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,502f2797-6aa9-5b6c-b05f-6d28d3355a2e","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Mount of the Holy Cross"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.479,39.4681]},"bbox":[-106.4795824775168,39.467650339818135,-106.47841752248321,39.468549660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746545","area_id":"UC8nl2qpW2ywX20o0zVaLg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.4795824775168,39.467650339818135],[-106.47841752248321,39.467650339818135],[-106.47841752248321,39.468549660181864],[-106.4795824775168,39.468549660181864],[-106.4795824775168,39.467650339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:50.459Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:10.042Z"}
