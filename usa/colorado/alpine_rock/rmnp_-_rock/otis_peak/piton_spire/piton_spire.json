Climb it to a ledge.\n\nMove slightly left to climb more slabs/wide crack/right-facing dihedral to another ledge.\n\nClimb short broken terrain up to the summit ridge, and head right up the ridge to the top.\n\nTo descend, rap off summit to notch behind spire (single rope), then a double rope rap into the gully to the east.
