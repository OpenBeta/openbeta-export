Start up a short gully to reach the face.  Pitch 1 faces west. The others face south. Btween pitch 1 and 2 we moved the belay up to where it gets steep again. There are nice cracks and slabs above. We moved the belay between pitches 3 and 4 also.  This helps save time.  Near the end of the last pitch - where it faces out, move left to the west side to finish up.\n\nDescend a double rope rap to the climber's left of the tower (west/south).
