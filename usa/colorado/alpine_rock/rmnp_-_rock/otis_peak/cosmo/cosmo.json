Climb the right side/face of the chimney feature.  The rock is good on this side and has many cracks for protection. Head to the top of this feature, belay on a large ledge.  Head up from the ledge on easy ramps and grassy ledges to another large ledge. On the right side of this large ledge, move up a broken, right-facing, dihedral system with lots of cracks on the right face. Continue up to the summit ridge. once on the ridge head up it to the the summit on easy ground.","protection":"Standard rack to a #4 Camalot.","location":"From the summit, step down to a large, square ledge to access the rap anchor (a long cord around the block you are standing on). Maybe bring extra webbing to back this up, or in case the wind blew it away! Do a double rope rap to the saddle behind the tower (note: we rapped to the SW side of the saddle). Then from the saddle, walk down the gully on the east side of the tower. About halfway down this gully, it chokes down and gets steep. There are lots on pine trees about at this level. Walk through the pines and around on a ledge to the front face (where you climbed). Look for stacked rocks that we marked the area with.  There is a 2 stopper rap anchor out there.\n\nDo another double rope rap. This will bring you down to start area of the climb."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,64811f23-75aa-5afa-937f-f7e306116e59,ff92f2d5-1bce-537a-b081-95b5de088217","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","Otis Peak","Cosmo"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.6805,40.2922]},"bbox":[-105.68108952005817,40.29175033981814,-105.6799104799418,40.29264966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106897218","area_id":"/5Ly1RvOU3qwgZW13giCFw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:51.800Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:33.678Z"}
