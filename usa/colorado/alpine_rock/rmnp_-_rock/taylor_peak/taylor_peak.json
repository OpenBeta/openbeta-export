The climbing is similar in character to\n\nKiener's Route\n\n, including some tiptoe ledges much like Broadway on Long's Peak. It's an easy climb in an exciting place.\n\nAt the bottom of Taylor's east face, find the hanging snowfield angling left toward the peak's southeast shoulder. Climb the snowfield (in July this was about 400 feet of crampon-friendly snow, approaching 55 degrees) to the top where it ends at a small col.\n\nFrom the col, turn right and climb a short 5.6 pitch up any of several dihedrals and corners. Traverse right and up, out onto the east face. This is mostly 4th class, but you may find a short pitch or two of 5th-class where a rope is desirable.\n\nNearing the central buttress you will find a large, shallow gully with many short, steep steps, faces, corners, and headwalls.
