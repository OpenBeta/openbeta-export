Not only is the line itself the most obvious directissima on the wall, but the climbing is really good and the crux pitch is one of the gems of the Park.\n\nAfter approaching via any of the methods listed for Arrowhead, begin climbing from the highest of a series of ledges below the obvious, hanging, left-facing dihedral.  This feature is several hundred feet right of the low-point in the McHenry's-Arrowhead ridge and about a hundred feet left of\n\nIthaca\n\n.  The first pitch is just left of the clean slab of Ithaca's first pitch.  Above the dihedral system the beautiful splitter crack of the crux pitch is visible.\n\nP1: Wander up the path of least resistance to a belay ledge about 25 feet below the true start of the corner system.  Do not continue up to what appears to be a sloping ledge at the base of the corner itself as the belay there is poor.  Low 5th.\n\nP2: Climb up the corner with good gear and increasingly difficult moves until an opportunity presents itself to swing out of the corner onto the right hand wall and climb the arete for 40 feet.  Wild!  One can either return to the corner higher up, or continue along the arete to a belay stance.  5.10+, 140'.\n\nP3: With a handful of wires, this pitch is easily linked with the previous one.  Continue up the slightly mossy corner all the way to a nice belay ledge (5.10c?), or, after 20 feet, once again swing out right around the arete and follow unprotected, clean face climbing to the same belay ledge (5.10a R).  A short pitch, maybe 50'.\n\nP4: Amazing!  Ascend the now shallow, left-facing corner for 40 feet before reaching a small roof on the left side.  Pull through this and continue up the stunning splitter past a few cruxy sections punctuated by really good rests.  This pitch takes great, small gear (that is pumpy to place), but it is nice to have some hand-size cams for pods and the anchor.  Lots of thin but positive 5.11 climbing up immaculate rock with one brief section of 5.11+.  Belay on a huge ledge, 120'.\n\nP5: Although a bit scary and having less than ideal pro, this pitch is nevertheless great fun.  From the right end of the ledge, ascend a corner to a chockstone and then hand traverse back left over your belayer's head for 15 feet.  Climb a nice, leaning, finger crack and pull up onto a stance at some loose blocks.  Swing around to the right, then trend back left up a series of stacked blocks all the way to the ridge.  5.9 and possibly very dangerous, 80'.\n\nDescend via the walk-off or rappels (one 70m rope plus easy downclimbing).","protection":"Double set of cams from small to #0.5 Camalot, single #0.75, #1, #2, #3.

The seldom-traveled line was a bit scaly underfoot, and that added a bit to the excitement.\n\nWe did clean it up a bit and brush holds and scrape off some small chips, but it is best to consider this something well beyond an \"entry level\" alpine route, regardless.

Save a  #2/#3 Camalot for the belay.\n\nP2/P3. 5.10, R, 115'  The P2 is independent and avoids the big left traverse to get to\n\nSidewinder\n\n. Instead, you head directly up some flakes and flares that rise up and left, and face left. These rise about 50' to meet the bottom end of a left-facing, left-leaning overhanging corner. Climb up and into that corner (good gear now available), and proceed to its end on a few jams between flares and liebacks. You will reach a ledge that is listed as the original belay, which would kind of break up an otherwise good pitch. Continue up 8' into a second, similar corner, and climb that to the top for several more meters. After 35 meters total, you will arrive on a ledge between 2 flakes with a spike/horn of rock that can be slung with webbing but should be backed up with gear.

There are several stellar lines up this part of the cliff, including\n\nIthaca\n\n(12a) and\n\nAirhead\n\n(11d).\n\nIthaca\n\nis probably the most distinct of all the lines in the area, as it follows the long, left-facing corner system left of Arrowplane.\n\nThis is a brilliant and sustained climb on excellent granite. The rock on this wall is like a steeper version of Lumpy. Orange splitters and good featured faces. It wanders up cracks for 5 pitches before forging up the \"lightning Bolt\" crack (5.11) on the last pitch headwall. One of the more memorable pitches in the Park!\n\nStart by fourth classing to the bottom of the clean, concave wall right of the lowest point of the ridge on Arrowhead/McHenry's. One might want to rope up to reach the ledge below the first pitch as the approach meanders up some smooth easy slabs.\n\nP1. Climb up a blank slab and water streaks to some right facing flakes and a ledge. 5.8 spice? 175'\n\nP2. Traverse right along some grassy ledges and boulder up into a crack system above. Now follow these up past a small gold colored roof and up to a small ledge. 5.9.\n\nP3. Continue with obvious cracks above, passing a jammmed flake, which grow steeper and lead to a small left facing corner with twin finger cracks. Climb up this awesome corner(5.9) and step across right at it's top.Exciting 5.10 and head right to belay at a spike below a splitter that forks above.\n\nP4. Head straight up the fantastic crack and go left when it splits. Head around the giant flake on its left side and up to a small ledge below the killer Lightning Bolt crack. 5.10  It is possible to go right at the base of the flake when the crack forks, it leads to the same belay and looks fantastic. But requires some bold moves to begin. Bernard says it is 5.11a R getting into it.\n\nWe stopped at a ledge before the Lightning bolt and did a small but stout 10c pitch in a small, left-facing corner and block to gain the actual stance below the headwall. A 60 meter rope could probobly combine these.\n\nP5. No route finding here. Step up and send the incredible 100ft. lightning bolt crack with bouldery moves off the belay to sustained stoking up above. 5.11 crux. Continue up through the maze of stacked blocks above, scary looking but very solid and mantle onto the ridge. Incredible 5.9.\n\nWalk left a few hundred feet and rappel off a boulder in the lowest point of the saddle. Two or three fixed raps get you to 3rd class terrain, just left of the starting ledge.","protection":"Rack up to #4 Friend with extra finger size. 2 60 meter ropes required for the raps.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,09f2c583-ed39-5172-85bb-6d4772e26308,90bd88de-1b53-50a5-afd5-8b800cb3616b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","Glacier Gorge","Arrowhead"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":3,"label":"5.9"},{"count":2,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":3,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":25,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":5,"intermediate":13,"advanced":6,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":25,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":5,"intermediate":13,"advanced":6,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":5,"intermediate":13,"advanced":6,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.65,40.2683]},"bbox":[-105.65058931169497,40.26785033981814,-105.64941068830503,40.26874966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745588","area_id":"kL2I3htTUKWv1YuADLNhaw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:52.468Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:35.103Z"}
