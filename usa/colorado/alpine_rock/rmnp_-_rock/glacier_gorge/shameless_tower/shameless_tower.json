Locate a large flake at the base of the wall, and shoot for that. Climb slabs left of said flake to access a grassy ramp.

You will not be able to see the fixed gear until it's right in front of your face, the crack is slightly offset. Follow the topo. The climbing to here is solo-able if you choose (5.don't fall).\n\nP1. From this point, you have 2 options to the next major ledge system. The line (climbers left) indicates a path that I would call 5.7. The line that heads climbers right through an arching crack that is ~5.10 to the ledge. Once on the ledge, locate a small alcove/right-facing corner. There are 2 stoppers to belay from in that corner (5.7 or 5.10 70m).\n\nP2. Walk climber's left on the ledge until at the end of the system. Climb a left-facing corner and flakes. Stay climber's left when possible aiming for a broken crack system and more left-facing corners. There is no fixed gear on top of this pitch. Build a gear anchor or sling large blocks (5.9 70m).\n\nP3. The final headwall pitch. This starts on the arete. There are 2 bolts before the 1st overlap. You get a few cam placements while climbing through the overlaps/small roofs. Pull out of the roofs on crimps, and make your way back to the arete gaining a Â bolt. From here, angle up and right clipping the last bolt and entering a thin crack. This crack protects with 0.1 & 0.2 cams in the beginning then opens up to 0.3/yellow Mastercam size.

It connects crack systems along the right side of this pronounced pillar in four full pitches.\n\nTo start look for a large, worm-shaped pillar at the start of pitch two, about 250 feet above the grassy ledges/slabs. Start down and right of this pillar on a ledge 20' below a right facing corner with a left-angling splitter on it's right wall. A spot of fifth class gets you to this ledge, coming in from the right.\n\nAnother landmark is the beautiful handcrack at the end of the second pitch that splits an obvious red wall.\n\nTo descend, walk right (east) a few hundred feet to the lowest point of the ridge, and do three rappels on fixed anchors with two ropes.\n\n1. Climb the angling splitter to a pair of short handcracks, that lead to a detached spike. Angle left, then right on moderate terrain to a belay below a tight, left-facing corner (the left side of the worm shaped pillar). 180'.\n\n2. Climb up this corner (10-), to some wedged blocks. Undercling [left] (10-). Head up to a right arching flake. Climb the flake (thin 10-) to another left-facing dihedral. Up this corner with brilliant exit moves out onto the face below the splitter handcrack. Climb the handcrack and belay just as your partner is about to start climbing. 190'.\n\n3. Go up a ramp on the left, up into a corner system (5.8) and follow this for thirty feet. Step right at an obvious, thin, right-arching flake. Layback the flake (pumpy 10+) to a sloping, awkward ledge. Balance right and belay. 170'.\n\n4. Climb a short corner and do a weird mantle onto a grassy ledge. The crux corner starts off this ledge. Climb the corner and obvious, crack system above with very sustained stemming and jamming (11+) 190'.
