Stepping over to the crack is committing. Follow a low angle finger crack up to a grassy ledge, then layback a left-trending dihedral to a short traverse under a roof, which takes you to a splitter crack. The crack starts as thin hands and eventually widens to fists and wider. Build an anchor up top, and walk off climber's left.\n\nOne could pull the roof into the finger crack directly, this would probably go around mid-10.","protection":"Rack to #4 Camalot.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,09f2c583-ed39-5172-85bb-6d4772e26308,2076f1a7-b500-512c-836c-f241ad59a409","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","Glacier Gorge","Rain Delay Crag"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.63121,40.25944]},"bbox":[-105.63179923451584,40.25899033981813,-105.63062076548417,40.25988966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111990512","area_id":"IHbxp7UAUSyDbPJBrVmkCQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.63179923451584,40.25899033981813],[-105.63062076548417,40.25899033981813],[-105.63062076548417,40.25988966018187],[-105.63179923451584,40.25988966018187],[-105.63179923451584,40.25899033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:52.467Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:12.785Z"}
