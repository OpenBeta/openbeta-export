Start at Solitude Lake. Climb Arrowhead. Traverse west on the McHenry's-Arrowhead ridge, and then climb the\n\nNE Ridge of McHenry's\n\n. Descend from the summit to the NW, then off the west side of the ridge to the upper reaches of the gully behind McHenry's Notch. 1 rap gets you into the gully. Climb Mt. Powell. Descend to the NW until you can drop on to the NE ridge that leads to Thatchtop. This ridge is amazing in its exposure and views of the Cathedral Spires. Continue to the summit of Thatchtop, and then descend back to Solitude Lake, or to the north if you are familiar with the descent for\n\nAll Mixed Up\n\n.\n\nThis is an excellent 1-day outing, or bivy in the Solitude Lake bivy area for a treat.","protection":"You may want to bring ropes and some webbing for the rap into McHenry's Notch.
