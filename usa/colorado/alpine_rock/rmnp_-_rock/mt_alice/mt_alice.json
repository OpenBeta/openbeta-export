It begins and ends at the same places as the\n\nCenter Ramp\n\n, but follows the left side of the ramp for three pitches. The rock on this route is decent but quite lichenous and is very slick when wet. The climbing is varied, less well-protected, and somewhat less aesthetic than the\n\nCenter Ramp\n\n, but provides an alternative if the regular route is \"crowded.\" In addition, this route description provides a guide for those who get off-route on the mountain, which, if our experience is any indication, is fairly common.\n\nThe first ascentionists are not known, but given the popularity of Mt Alice, it's likely someone else has been this way before. When we climbed the route in August 2009 it showed no signs of previous traffic except for a very iffy-looking rap sling on the variation's first pitch (P4 below).  In any case, we will cheerfully yield the FA to anyone who has a viable claim to a previous FA.\n\nP1-P3: Ascend the\n\nCenter Ramp\n\nroute's two approach pitches and the 5.8 dihedral option (not the 5.5 chimney) on for the first 5th-class pitch as described for the Center Ramp.\n\nP4: From the belay atop the 5.8 dihedral, move the belay right and as far up as practical and ascend a broken, left-facing dihedral/chimney with a slung chockstone about 15m up. Exit right above the chockstone, climb some vague cracks for another 10m, then step left onto a crystal-studded wall (5.7, marginal pro). Set a hanging belay on poor pro at the top of the crystal wall, or stretch the rope up and right for another 5-10m to a cramped ledge with better pro. 60m, 5.7R.\n\nP5: From the cramped ledge, traverse right and slightly down for about 8m along a substantial crack with a couple of loose stones. Ascend an obvious hand crack for several moves, then move left into a second crack. Climb the crack, then traverse right for 5-10m and climb easy cracks and face to a broad, grassy ledge. Eat lunch. 5.8, 35m.\n\nP6: Climb straight up from the left side of the ledge, then traverse right for 15m on easy ground. Set an optional belay at the base of a battered-looking chimney, or continue up the chimney. Step right into some shallow cracks, and head up and right to a prominent ledge about 10m below a roof. This is the top of the\n\nCenter Ramp's\n\n4th pitch as described elsewhere. 5.7, 50m\n\nFinish the route via the\n\nCenter Ramp\n\ndescription.","protection":"A standard rack to #3 Camalot size is sufficient.

Start in the large, left-facing corner/gully. Climb 150 feet to a belay spot under a smaller, left-facing corner to the left of the original, larger gully/left-facing corner, 5.4/5.5.\n\nP2 (crux #1). There are two options here: either the smaller, left-facing corner to climber's left or the larger one on the right - both looked about 5.7. There was snow on the right, so we went left. This pitch had a few 5.8 moves as well as a small ledge about 50 feet from the start of the pitch that required two A1 moves: the first was a nut at the lip of the ledge, and the second was a nut just above the ledge. Once past this ledge, there was a nice belay spot about 30 feet below the ridge (one could probably climb through this short aid section at about 5.10). (Please note the original climb may have gone climber's right up the larger corner system at 5.7 A1.)\n\nP3. Go up and left eventual gaining the ridge, easy 5.4/5.5 climbing. The second half of this relatively long pitch is on the ridge. One stops at about 100-120 feet due to rope drag.\n\nP4. Climb another relatively easy 5.4/5.5 ridge pitch, staying mostly on climber's left of the ridge. This is a long pitch, which may be broken in two if rope drag is an issue. This brings you to a gendarme. You end up belaying on climber's left of the gendarme at the base of a chute/gully with multiple cracks/ridges going through it.\n\nP5. One can likely climb the chute mentioned above to climber's left of the gendarme (we didn’t do this so not 100% it would go, but this is likely the original route). Instead we went right about 30 feet around a corner and up a large chimney that bisects the gendarme. This went at 5.7, but the rockfall hazard in the chimney was significant. Belay from the top of the gendarme (~80 foot pitch).\n\nP6. Climb about 120 feet of easy 5.4/5.5 climbing on the left of a broad ridge line to some grassy ledges below the final headwall and its very large chimney. Belay here (see the photo).\n\nP7. I would suggest splitting the final, massive chimney into two pitches due its length (200-220 feet). The chimney can be wet, for us in June it was wet and had verglas ice over half of it - perhaps later in summer there would be easier, multiple route options. Climb about 80 feet (5.6+) up to a nice belay ledge where the chimney is bisected in two by a ridge within in.\n\nP8 (crux #2) - 120 feet, 5.8. Going left of the ridge looked too steep and wet. Instead, we went to the right but had to downclimb after 30 feet due to verglas. This side couldn’t be aided (if dry and ice-free, it looked about 5.7). We instead climbed/gained the ridge in the chimney directly - starting on its right-hand side. It was a committing 5.8 move to gain the ridge without good protection (PG-13). Climb this small ridge in the chimney at 5.5/5.6 until you reach another steep section about 60 feet above the belay. Here one pulls a right-sided layback (body to right) along good but not reassuringly stable fins of rock (again 5.8, PG-13). You then climb at 5.6/5.4 to the top of the chimney where you break the crest and set up a belay on one of the big boulders up and to the right.\n\nNext, scramble 400 feet of 3rd Class rock to the summit. We encountered one easy snow section in June across a small col - a slip (unlikely) would let you fall off the east face.\n\nWalk south along easy scree following a rudimentary trail down to a Class 2 gully back to the base of the east face. This descent col starts just north of a large boulder/rock outcropping. Crampons weren’t necessary for the descent.\n\nPer\n\nGreg Davis\n\n: the first ascent was on a sunny day to start out, but late afternoon snowstorm trapped us on the summit for an unplanned and unpleasant bivouac.","protection":"One set of nuts (3-10) and one set of cams (0.3-3). One can do the aid with slings and converted double/cordalette—etriers/fifis/daisies useful but likely overkill for 2 A1 moves. Crampons are required in June. An ice axe was nice but not required. Bring light mountain boots or approach shoes.","location":"The climb starts at the top of the massive gully on the right side of the east face.

It has a little lichen and loose rock but no more than most of the other alpine walls in the park. The long approach means that you have a good chance of being the only party on the mountain. (although if there is another climbing party, it will likely be on this route) The climbing is sustained in the 5.7 - 5.8 range and offers a little bit of everything... snow, stemming, laybacks, hand cracks, chimneys etc. You won't see the storms coming from the west but you'll get some terrific views of Wild Basin!\n\nTo reach the base of the route you have a few options. A) Climb the obvious snow tongue on the left. B) Climb a couple easy pitches starting just to the right of the snow. C) Climb the ramp, which approaches from the bottom right. (4th class and loose) I started down this ramp once and quickly decided that it was too nasty. It is probably better going up. My preference is the snow if it is soft enough to kick steps.\n\nOnce you're above the snow/easy pitches/ramp, an easy scramble up flower-covered grassy ledges and white rock leads to the base of the route proper.  This description assumes you are using 60-meter ropes.\n\n(1) The guidebook says to climb a 5.5 chimney on the right. I haven't climbed this pitch but it looks somewhat boring. A nice alternative is the beautiful 5.8 dihedral on the left. It has decent pro and offers some excellent stemming.\n\n(2) From the top of the first pitch, you have a choice of following the huge right-facing dihedral up the left edge of the ramp or a left-facing dihedral/crack system that runs up the center/right side of the ramp. This is a description of the right option. Stretch the rope up to a small ledge below a 3-foot roof that runs diagonally up and to the right. 5.7\n\n(3) Traverse up and right staying under the roof until you reach a large chimney with lots of features, including a couple choke stones. Continue up this chimney until it is possible to exit left onto a short ramp/ledge system. This is another long pitch. 5.7\n\n(4) Climb up the left edge of the obvious cleft via laybacks, stems, and jams and continue past another choke stone to belay under a large roof. 5.8\n\n(5) From under the roof, climb a short wall on the west side via a shallow right-facing dihedral. Then continue up another 30 feet to a nice hand crack in an open corner. From the top of the hand crack, a ramp leads up and right to the top of the route. 5.8\n\nThe descent also offers a few options. A) Descend to the south and then the southeast to gain the grassy southeast face of Alice and follow this back to east side of Alice. B) Descend to the south along the Continental Divide until you reach Boulder Grand Pass. Descend on the north side of the snow and take the pass back to the Thunder Lake trail. C) Descend to the north via Hourglass Ridge (class 3) until you reach the saddle between Alice and Chief's Head. Turn southeast and follow the obvious ridge back to the Lion Lake trail.","protection":"A typical alpine rack up to 2\" will suffice.
