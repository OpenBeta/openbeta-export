Snark ascends the left center of the main NE face in a direct line, ending near the summit cairn.  Approach is made on a huge diagonal ledge, most easily attained at its lower right side.  The route itself can be located with reference to a great left-leaning pillar or finger of rock, at least half the height of the face.  The climb reaches the U-shaped ledge area at the lower right corner of this formation, and continues up in a vertical line to its right to the top of the face.\n\nP1)  Climb cracks toward the U for a ropelength, belaying below a smooth section.\n\nP2)  Follow a curving flake/crack system up the slab to the right.  When it ends, move back up and left to ledges at the base of the broken, black-washed U.\n\nP3)  Ascend obvious chimneys to a large, comfortable ledge.\n\nP4)  The climb's best pitch.  Ignoring less interesting alternatives to the right and left, go straight up a fantastic hand-sized crack on the face above the ledge.  When it ends walk right to attain a system of steep flakes angling back up and left.  Follow the flakes to a belay.\n\nP5)  Steep face climbing leads out right and up for a pitch to a broken area below the summit.\n\nP6)  An easy short lead to the top.","protection":"The FA party found good protection with a light rack of stoppers, hexes and runners.
