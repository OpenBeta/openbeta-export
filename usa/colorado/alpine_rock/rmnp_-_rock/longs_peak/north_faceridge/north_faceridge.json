The route follows the ridge from the Keyhole to the summit.\n\nFrom the hut at the Keyhole, hike south up the ramp on the east face until below the False Keyhole, and then head straight up (possibly roping up), to the hiker warning sign.  From here, the route finding is slightly tricky, and there are a couple different ways to go.  We headed south across the east face of the obvious tower for a pitch, and from there headed straight up dirty rock (5.6) to the summit of the tower.  From the top, we dropped down the backside about 10 feet to an obvious ledge, and followed it south.  Be very careful as there is much loose rock and the hiking trail is below.\n\nFollow the ledge to the obvious notch before the next large tower.  Scramble south up the obvious ramp, and then break left and head south on narrow ledges across the east face of the tower.  At a right facing corner (possible fixed pin), head straight up the face following the path of least resistance (5.6).  This is another possibly tricky route finding section.

It is about halfway between the Cables Route and the Keyhole Ridge. This route is nice alternative to the Cables Route if you want some variety. The technical difficultes are about four pitches long, so it is much longer than the one-pitch Cables route. Since it is on a buttress it is free of snow much earlier than the Cables Route and can be climbed in rock shoes (temperatures permitting) in winter.\n\nAscend the lower rock buttress from the left or right side. The left side is shorter if coming up from the Boulder Field and looks easier and more rock intensive. At the top of the lower buttress things look pretty intimidating - much steeper than you expect.

It is just filed under that rock. I give this route one star, but not because it is a bad route.  It is an excellent first technical alpine route for a beginner.  After doing the route, however, I would probably not be interested in doing it again unless it was a winter ascent, which would be different.\n\nThe history of the route is kinda interesting.  I'm not sure of specific dates, but in the early part of the 1900's a thick steel cable was bolted to the rock with huge eye bolts (much like the bolts on the 3rd).  Non-technical climbers would use this as an aid to climb up this face of Longs.  That is until people started to realize that a 1in. thick cable bolted to the rock for hundreds of feet is a great conductor of electricity.  The cable was removed, but a couple of the eye bolts still exist at the belays.\n\nThis climb is best started from the boulder field at the base of Long's approaching from the East.  From the boulder field, the hike is only about 0.25mi. to  the start of the climb and about 1.5mi. descent from the backside (W. side) of Long's.  Otherwise, you're looking at a 6 mi. hike just to the boulder field with a full  pack of gear.  Best climbed mid summer through early fall (unless you bring crampons).  I climbed it mid-October in 1998 and it was cold and coated with a nice layer of verglass (thin ice).  This changed the grade from easy 5.4 to very contemplative 5.6-7ish.\n\nThere is only really one full pitch of technical climbing, then it's very easy 5th and 4th class for a pitch or so.  After this, 3rd class get you to the summit, taking the line toward the edge of the diamond, then back to the summit.\n\nThe ranger station at the Longs trailhead has a nice 3D model of Longs and a ranger will be happy to show you the exact line. Descent is a downclimb of the same route (raps possible from the eye bolts) or via the standard Keyhole route.","protection":"Very minimal rack. A few large stoppers and some hexes or tri-cams.
