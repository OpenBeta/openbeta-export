Much of the route later went free, most notably the first pitch dihedral by Roger Briggs in 1976, and then later the \"A4 Traverse\" by Charlie Fowler and Dan Stone in 1978.  This last effort marked the free climbing of the original line in its entirety at 5.11b R, although several variations allow the climb to go free at easier and/or safer grades [Editor's Note: Credit goes out to\n\nPatrick Vernon\n\nand\n\nBosier Parsons\n\nfor their contributions to the Mountain Project database of the most common variation of the Yellow Wall and the A4 Traverse, respectively].\n\nFind the start by following a narrow catwalk up and left from the Broadway bivy cave to the first, obvious, left-facing dihedral.  This corner has a few pins in it and appears quite thin from below.\n\nP1: Hard moves right off the deck, climb the dihedral with imperfect but adequate gear until the corner disappears and turns into an intermittant hand and finger crack splitter.  Follow this to an obvious belay at 150' on some flakes.  5.11b.  Alternatively, beginning just right of the corner, follow a ramping system of flakes up and right, then back left, eventually rejoining the corner at about 75'.  This variation avoids the 5.11 at 5.7, but the climbing up the remainder of the original first pitch still checks in at 5.9.\n\nP2: Continue up the steep crack system via very cool climbing and great rock.  The pitch climbs like a face climb but utilizes the crack for pro.  Also, much fixed pro on this pitch.  Belay on another flake/ledge.  5.9, 150'.\n\nP3: Continue up the same system.  The climbing is very similar but a bit steeper.  High on the pitch there are several fixed pins and suddenly Crossover Ledge becomes apparent 10' to the left.  Clip a high pin and make a difficult move left to the ledge.  It may be possible to continue straight up the crack system, but Crossover Ledge makes a sensible belay.  5.10c, 150'.\n\nP4: Above the ledge the crack system continues up and into Black Dagger.  Climb up off the right end of the ledge, and forego the Black Dagger by doing a wild, exposed traverse right.  Continue up and right to an obvious left-facing, right-leaning corner with a hand crack.  Up above this is the\n\nForrest Finish\n\n(5.10c), a popular escape from/variation of the original Yellow Wall (climbing the Yellow Wall this way is known as the \"Briggs/Candelaria Variation\").  Belay about 15' below the A4 Traverse at a small stance; this stance is about 20' up the corner, and above the level of a few old rusty Leeper bolts that appear on the wall way off to the right.  5.9, 100', and a great pitch.\n\nP5: The A4 Traverse.  In order to give credit to\n\nBosier Parsons\n\n, I'm using his excellent description for this pitch, with some minor edits afterwards to serve as an update:\n\n\"This is a description of the A4 Traverse pitch on the Yellow Wall. I decided to add it to encourage those who aspire to climbing it. The pitch is excellent in quality and does deserve the rating given, but it is definitely very doable, and not horribly dangerous. If you've been wanting to climb this pitch but have been afraid of the serious rating, get up there and do it! If you want to attempt the pitch with minimal beta and have more of an adventure experience, do not read on.\n\nThe belay at the end of the pitch off of Crossover Ledge can be made at the base of the first wide section on Forrest Finish, or, it is better to climb the right leaning, left-facing corner, via 5.9+ hands to a good but small ledge about 30 feet higher. This is in the middle of the left facing dihedral that begins the A4 Traverse pitch.\n\nFrom the higher belay, continue up the corner about 15-20 more feet via 5.9+ or 5.10- liebacking. At the nest of webbing with a couple pitons, hand traverse right for a couple moves, then mantle up onto the thin ledge. Once on the ledge, you will find a good piton, then a rurp with a very old piece of webbing. Continue traversing the ledge about 15 more feet to a fixed bashie, just below the crux move. This traverse ledge is very small and thin, but pretty easy to walk across. The bashie protects the crux move and is bomber. Believe me, I tested it with about a 20 footer (with rope stretch). The crux move takes you up into a shallow, left-facing corner, that involves strenuous liebacking with small footholds. This section is protected by one 5/8\" angle driven about 1/2 way (but seemed decent enough), and then at the top by a fixed wire. I thought this corner seemed like sustained 5.10+ climbing for about 20-25 feet. At the top of this corner, pull up onto another ledge, and traverse right and up past some more fixed pins to a steep left-facing corner. Climb this corner for about 40 more feet of 5.10 with gear from 1/2\" to 3\". I placed my #3 Camalot for the exit move from this corner onto the large ledge where the route joins the\n\nCasual Route\n\n(still 40 feet below Yellow Wall Bivvy Ledge), but I'm sure many climbers would not need this piece of gear on this pitch. Belay here or continue up easily to YWBL (190').\"\n\nUpdates as of August, 2007:  The nest of webbing at the top of the first corner is no longer there.  The pin at the start of the traverse can be backed up with a small cam placed a few feet above it.  The webbing on the RURP looks really bad, as does the copperhead, but a fall from the crux move would probably be safe, albeit terrifying, even if they both blew.  The pin in the second corner (above the bashie), seemed decent and it can be backed up with RPs and a 00 TCU, but the fixed wire at the top of this corner is no longer there.\n\nI thought this pitch had excellent climbing and was well worth doing, although the fixed pro is pretty suspect.  If the gear held, as it did for\n\nBosier\n\n, a fall would be no big deal at all.\n\n5.11a, 190'.\n\nP6: The\n\nCasual Route's\n\ncrux pitch.  Continue up difficult finger cracks to a squeeze chimney to another difficult finger crack and belay on Table Ledge.  5.10a, 150'.\n\nEvidently, most parties traverse off on Table Ledge at this point, but two more, seldom done and dirty/wet pitches continue upwards.\n\nP7: Hand traverse 15' straight right on Table Ledge and then climb a wet, moss and mud choked crack system for 50' before traversing slightly left to a right-facing corner.  Folllow this up to the right end of the huge roof system above.  Belay at a stance.  5.10+, 120'.\n\nP8:  Follow the right-facing corner above the roof via a wide crack up to the top of the wall.  Wet, 5.9, 150'.\n\nDescend via the\n\nNorth Face/Cables\n\nor by reversing upper\n\nKiener's\n\nand doing the D7 raps.","protection":"Double set from tiny to thin hands, single #2 & #3 Camalots.

The route is in a south facing dihedral on the left edge of the Diamond.\n\nThe Obelisk itself starts about halfway between Broadway and Table Ledge. There are two standard methods of getting from TL to the first pitch of the Obelisk: via\n\nPervertical Sanctuary\n\nor the Window Direct. Either of these approaches is problematic.\n\nThe\n\nPV\n\napproach climbs the first three pitches of\n\nPV\n\n(excellent climbing) then traverses left to the Obelisk dihedral. The traverse, if done from the 3rd belay of PV is said to be hairy -- 5.11R. [Gillett] writes than he once did this traverse in the opposite direction and it was not bad; he believes he probably traversed lower than\n\nPV's\n\n3rd belay. At any rate, this traverse is capable of gumming up the works.\n\nThe Window Direct approach, which we did, looks efficient on paper -- two pitches, 5.7 and 5.5. The first pitch starts just right of a huge, right-facing corner at the top of the the menacing snow/ice field which obstructs Broadway below PV; add an extra pitch for dealing with this obstacle. To avoid the snowfield, we traversed on the small ledge system that starts around\n\nYellow Wall\n\nand parallels Broadway about 20' above it. We followed this easy traverse for more than a rope length until we intercepted a [vertical] crack system w/ some fixed pins (about 30-50' right of the huge corner). We belayed at the end of the traverse. We climbed the crack system upwards and slightly left for about 100', belaying just below a long ledge system of black rock; this pitch featured supspect rock, intermittent pro and was harder than the 5.9 last pitch of\n\nPV\n\n. The next pitch went up to the ledge system and traversed right for 200' w/ some up, down, left and right to the base of the Obelisk dihedral; though the climbing on this pitch might be 5.5 it includes bad rock, scant pro (including some Dolemite [style] fixed pins) and a culminating [vegetated], wet, protection-free slab with horrible rope drag. These two pitches of WD rate a Bomb.\n\nThe Obelisk: P1 (5.11a, 100') This 3* pitch which utilizes cracks of the right wall and in the corner is strenuous but not too technical. Extra hand size cams are useful. Belay at a worthless 1/4\" bolt and a so-so ledge. If this pitch were more accessible, it might be considered the classic handcrack of the [Front Range].\n\nP2 (5.10a, 30') Continue up the corner to a better ledge the base of the offwidth. This pitch could sensibly be combined with the previous, gear permitting -- a second yellow Alien would help realize this linkup.\n\nP3 (5.11a, 80') A slightly overhanging 5-6\" crack in the corner which ends atop the pillar, at a good ledge shared with\n\nPV\n\n. Gear: almost the entire pitch accepts #4.5 Camalots; a #4 Camalot would be next to useless, while a #5 would only be useful at the end. Supplemental gear, ranging from small wires to hand-sized cams, is periodically available in a crack on the left, but placing this gear sometimes obstructs coveted hand holds. Kneepad recommended for left knee. All things considered, this is a very fun pitch; again, if this were at Lumpy or Vedawoo, it would be the classic of its type and grade. Despite the guidebook ratings, I found this pitch considerably easier than\n\nCrack of Fear\n\n(\"10d\") at Lumpy.\n\nP4 (5.9, 100') The last pitch of\n\nPV\n\nto Table ledge, belay about 40' south of rap anchors. This pitch seems like a cakewalk after what preceded it -- if the weather is threatening, you can really motor here.\n\nEXTRA BETA (onsighters stop reading):\n\nP1: Climb the corner for about 10' then traverse into the crack; going straight up the crack is 5.12ish campusing on painful fingerlocks. Extra beta: have a #0.75 Camalot on a quickdraw ready to plug at the end of the traverse. After 30'-40' of solid (if strenuous) handjamming, the crack narrows down, seemingly to thumbstacks; at this point, despair mounts, until you realize it is possible to stem back into the corner and breath a sigh of relief, assuming you have any breath left.\n\nP3: This is probably too obvious to be considered beta, but solid left side knee jams, sometimes with heel toe, can repeatedly be obtained. The right inside wall of the crack contains many hidden edges, particularly higher up. Getting started is kind of tough, but once you're moving the crux is about 1/3 of the way up; at the end of this section there is a a decent foothold on the right face, from which you can rest or at least hang out until gasping subsides; from this point the climbing eases [slightly].","protection":"We had: 1 set of stoppers from very small to medium with extra in the 1-4 Rock sizes. 1 each blue, green, yellow Alien; 2 each #1 - #3 Friend equivalent; 1 #3 Camalot; 2 #4.5 Camalots; 1 ea Tricams #1-#6.\n\nThis rack was sufficient, but it would have been nice to have a couple of more hand size SLCDs for the handcrack (replace the two biggest tricams w/ a #2.5 and #3 Friend).","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"gol3cO8RVlyaydiB3CeJBQ==","name":"The Honeymoon is Over","yds":"5.13c","grades":{"yds":"5.13c","french":"8a+"},"fa":"Tommy Caldwell","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.61384,40.25617]},"left_right_index":15,"mp_id":"110886709","mp_crag_id":"105744826","climb_id":"gol3cO8RVlyaydiB3CeJBQ==","areaRef":"NSfL77AcWB6++9BUJriMWA=="},"content":{"description":"The Honeymoon is Over is one of, if not the, most difficult routes on the Diamond.

The climbing is unrelenting, overhanging, strenuous, and intimidating, yet it also is varied, aesthetic, interesting, and memorable.  It is one of only two free climbs on the right side of the Diamond (so far), the other being the much more difficult The Joker (which, incidentally, is named after Derek).\n\nThe tenor of free climbing on the right side of the Diamond is noticeably different than the left (i.e. Yellow Wall) side.  Rock quality in the middle stretches is often fair to poor at best, with a decomposing, rotten nature, although there is some very good rock higher.  The wall is much steeper than on the Yellow Wall, and hence the climbing tends to be very strenuous and taxing, and the \"feel\" intimidating and exposed.  There can also be considerable seeping from snow melt on the higher pitches.\n\nFrom North Chimney head right on Broadway and locate the first crack system right of the first major pillar (i.e. the Green Pillar; the dihedral is the start of the Dunn-Westbay).  KoS is identified from below as the crack system which crosses the right side of the obvious \"S\" shaped roof a third of the way up (although the route starts in a system left of this).\n\nP1: Climb this 5.9 crack for 125 feet to a sling belay.\n\nP2: Continue up until the crack ends and traverse right (5.10-), then up and right to a belay on the right side of a ledge. There are 2 fixed pins at this belay- these are the last fixed anchors on the route. It would be very difficult to retreat from above this point since the route is so steep, and all anchors would be your own gear.\n\nP3: Step right and climb \"The Torture Chamber\", a rotten, poorly-protected 5.11a slot (the worst rock on the route- it crumbles in your hands); or climb the original line (slightly harder though better-protected) moving out of the slot and onto the wall to the left.  Set up a hanging belay 10 feet below the S-shaped roof; have several pieces up to 2.5\" to make this anchor bombproof, and since it's hanging consider a butt bag.  A lead of the Torture Chamber has been described as a \"Rites of Passage\" pitch.\n\nP4: Now tackle the strenuous 5.11- fist crack above (liebacking may work also), moving out of the crack right, then back left, up corners, to below a clean right-facing corner.  There may be slight variations to do in this pitch.  Belay at the highest possible stance directly below an impressive, clean R-facing corner (the Gilbert variation) at some bomber gear (1.5F, 2.5 F, large stopper).\n\nP5: Climb the crux corner (this is the Gilbert variation)- certainly 5.12a if you stay in it at the start, but you can climb a wee bit left for 20' before entering it.  At the top step left to the top of the column and belay.  Or, climb the original line, the left side of the column, at a slightly easier (5.11d) grade.  If this climbing were on Castle Rock, it would be more like 5.11c, but up there...The Gilbert variation is one of the top 3 classic \".12a\" pitches on the Diamond, the others being the crux leads of D1 and Ariana. It may be wet in places due to drips from above.\n\nP6: Now proceed directly up the 5.11 thin hands crack above, through Table Ledge (an overhang here), up 30 more feet of .10d to an inobvious, wet .10 traverse left to a stance- another long pitch.\n\nP7: Climb this crack to the top- wide, wet, and hard 5.10.  Luckily the gear is good on this pitch (some fixed pins, if you can find them under all the slime).\n\nThis is a great adventure climb, and folks with a better-than-average tolerance for poor rock could argue for a 3-star rating.  In 1995 this climb was linked with the Diagonal Super-Direct (V, 5.11d) on the Lower East Face in just under 11 hours.","protection":"Double set wired nuts to 3.5\" cams, with some extra wireds for the Gilbert Variation, and perhaps extra hand-size pieces.

Expect a bit more lichen than\n\nD7\n\n, but the cracks that are just as good (just not as polished yet).\n\nThe free climbing history of this route is somewhat convoluted. Consult Bernard Gillett’s excellent guidebook if interested. Bernard free climbed the majority of this route, but his toprope inspection of the headwall cracks revealed rotten and unprotectable rock above Table Ledge.\n\nWith Bernard’s recommendation, Ryan Montoya and I rappelled into the headwall and cleaned the next crack system to the left (and just right of\n\nEroica\n\n). We found solid rock, great climbing, and a nice traverse over to the top of the original line (which has good rock at the top). The next day we sent the route in its entirety.\n\nP1. There are three options. See the photo. 1a) original route, 10c roof, a vegetated crack. 1b) this is the route we took: A-frame roof with a bolt, stiff move off the deck (~10a), and trend right, then make a long, rising, leftward traverse. 1c) start in a left-facing corner at the left side of the\n\nD1\n\npillar.

First, the current description under the\n\nYellow Wall\n\nomits the last pitch, which is probably the crux of the FF, and second, the\n\nYellow Wall\n\nis not the FF, and vice versa, as much as we would like to say we've climbed the\n\nYellow Wall\n\nof the Diamond when we climb this variation (see comments under\n\nYellow Wall\n\n).\n\nI suggest the\n\nYellow Wall\n\nentry in the database be revised to describe the actual\n\nYellow Wall\n\nclimb and not just the easiest path up this part of the wall.\n\nPitches 4-6 of the Forrest Finish involve pretty burly and sustained hand/fist crack climbing.  There isn't any 5.10 offwidthing as stated in the Gillett guide, but it's still pretty darn physical.  It goes without saying that this type of crack climbing is pretty draining at 13,500+, and will probably feel more like 10+/11- if you're not well acclimitized (as is usually the case).\n\nTo start, climb the first 3 pitches of\n\nD7\n\nor\n\nYellow Wall\n\nto the right side of Crossover Ledge, each of which is 10-.  The\n\nD7\n\nvariation to FF (called Komito Freeway) is actually the path of the first free ascent of the DIamond by Goss & Logan, though they apparently switched over to\n\nBlack Dagger\n\nin the middle of the 6th pitch.\n\nP4- From the right side of Crossover Ledge (with the\n\nBlack Dagger\n\nslot looming above), climb up about 20 feet until you can find a rightward traverse that leads over to the FF crack system (5.9).  Climb the crack system to an obvious intimidating flare/OW.  Climb the OW with the help of a crack on the left (5.10) and contnue until rope drag stops you in your tracks and belay (150 feet).\n\nP5- Continue up the crack system through an OW (guide calls 10a but it felt more like 5.8/9).  Rest and then climb the burly, sustained hand/fist crack past some awkward pods (10) to belay alongside the\n\nYellow Wall\n\nbivy ledge (100 feet).\n\nP6- More wide hands (10) leads to a good rest with multiple options above.  The\n\nBlack Dagger\n\nsystem is the leftmost and looks like it is probably the easier way to go.  The FF takes the right variation and climbs a funky, insecure lieback (10) up into a slot.  Awkwardly climb the slot via a mix of kneebars and face features in the slot (10) up to Almost Table Ledge (150 feet).\n\nThe FF continues up from here via 2 more seldom-climbed 5.9 pitches to the top of the Diamond.  The usual option is to traverse left to a short right-facing dihedral where a pin protects a 5.8 move up to Table Ledge.\n\nDescend following the\n\nD7\n\nrappel route (6 raps) to Broadway and then 4 raps to the side of the N. Chimney to the Mills Glacier.  The alternate option, which is probably faster, traverses over to\n\nKiener's\n\nand follows that, skirting the summit, to the N. Face cables descent.  The disadvantage to the latter option is that you have to hike a grueling 400 vertical feet up\n\nKiener's\n\nlate in the day and that you can't stash your gear at the base of the wall.","protection":"Set of nuts.

The crux is short and protects well, and is easily aided.  Climbers who find the\n\nCasual Route\n\njammed, and don't have enough big gear for\n\nPervertical\n\n, should consider attempting this at 5.9 or 5.10 C1 (or free), but plan on a longer day if you aid much (the entire climb is still strangely popular as a clean aid route). The climbing is generally clean and solid, with many relic fixed pins set as reminders that in its heyday, this was the most popular route on the Diamond (FA: Dalke, Goss, Hurley 1966 at 5.6 A2). D7 is also the unquestioned favorite for those few demented souls who climb the Diamond in winter.  The descriptions in Rossiter, Gillett, Wadman and Dumais are all accurate, but if you do not have access to these what follows is a brief narrative describing the route.\n\nYou have survived North Chimney.  Now locate the bivy cave up and left from the top of North Chimney and\n\nCasual Route\n\n. Traverse left and low (below the loose ledge leading to\n\nYellow Wall\n\nstart) to an exposed, 4th Class or lower 5th Class step which leads to the second prominent left-facing corner system from the cave (the first being the 5.11 start to\n\nYellow Wall\n\n).\n\nClimb several pitches of finger and handcrack (5.9) in corners and around small flakes to a short wide section of low-end 5.10 (a couple of pieces to 4\" useful here) to a good ledge and a fixed anchor. If aiding, this wide section may be the crux. Climb the right and smaller of 2 right-facing corners directly above to a continuous section of stiff 5.10 and belay.  The free climbing crux looms above, a bulging section of white rock with parallel finger cracks splitting it (a fairly obvious feature).  Launch upwards, then strut your stuff on the pumpy-to-protect 15 feet of technical pulls where the angle steepens- classic, clean, and exposed climbing.  Belay on a small ledge, then climb a short difficult section (5.11a) leading to easier climbing and \"Almost\" Table Ledge (rap anchors).  Climb the easier rock above to Table Ledge and traverse slightly left to anchors (start of the rappels, which are \"climbers left\" from the route) or further left to\n\nKiener's\n\nand the North Face Cables descent.\n\n4 to 8 hours climbing time, although aid parties may take much longer- consider a bivy on Broadway.  There are several variations to this route (Soma and D Minor 7 are the major ones)and much opportunity for \"mixing and matching\" (it's even possible to head into Hidden Diamond or Curving Vine at one point), but really, D7 takes on the most compelling and recommended line between\n\nPervertical\n\nand\n\nYellow Wall\n\n.","protection":"Double set wired nuts to 3\" cams, 1 each 3.5, 4\", 8 QDs, 6 slings.

Sustained and pumpy, some funky rock, great exposure, classic history- simply a great place to be.  The first route climbed on the Diamond, it was freed in the late '70s via a horrendous, wet 5.11 chimney above Table Ledge that may still be unrepeated. The original aid line left of this was freed in the early '80s, and provides a difficult and exciting finale.  The route is obvious, taking the center plumb-line crack system to the apex of The Diamond.\n\nThe first 200-300 feet is moderate climbing (5.8-5.9), lower-angle (at least compared to above) and a bit broken.  If you have a pack, it may be efficient to have the second carry the pack instead of hauling.  It is also time-saving to simul-climb the first 2+ pitches.  Stay a bit right on the \"D1 pillar\" and it is easy to avoid climbers on the\n\nCasual Route\n\n.  After this lower section, belay just below the obvious 5.10 overhang, on the higher of 2 stances.  Climb the overhang, and a stretch of 5.10 above; with long slings down low you can avoid rope drag higher on the pitch.  Near the top of the pitch skip the belay stance at the base of the overhanging handcrack (bail slings here) and continue up 20-25 feet to a small but comfortable belay ledge on the left with good anchors.  Now you can skip the cramped hanging stance (bail slings here) midway up the pumpy hand crack in the overhanging wall and go all the way to the bivy ledge in one long pitch.  Somebody should replace the bolts at the bivy ledge.  From here, one rotten 5.10c pitch gets you to Table Ledge, a cramped stance/alcove at this point.  Have a rain jacket handy, even if the weather is splitter, because drips from the ice plug can soak you at this belay.  At Table Ledge step left (or barge straight up the wet 5.11 offwidth) and tackle a pumpy boulder problem which leads to sustained 5.11 climbing.  This is a long pitch that is waaaay up there.  The final 5.8 pitch may feel like the crux...wet, icy at times, and runout.\n\nNot everyone will agree with a 3-star rating, although some well-rounded Diamond climbers I know consider D1 the best Diamond climb.  It is not quite as sustained as\n\nKing of Swords\n\n, but the crux pitch is probably harder than anything on the\n\nKing\n\n, and the rock is better.  The crux pitch is among the best 5.12a Diamond pitches, along with the crux pitch on\n\nAriana\n\nand the Gilbert dihedral variation to\n\nKing of Swords\n\n.  Early season (June) D1 is often dry and climbable.","protection":"2-3 sets wires to #3 Friend, a #3.5 Friend or two, extra mid/large-size wires.  60m rope for the pitch combining beta (below).

The nature of the climbing, with short lived, well protected cruxes, makes it an excellent candidate for no rehearsal, ground up efforts.\n\nBegin by climbing the first five pitches of Eroica.
