From a distance, the climb is visible as a series of weaknesses on the left side of the headwall. Though primarily a scramble over moderate terrain, the technical climbing at the top is fun to climb.\n\nThere are numerous starts to this climb and others on the left side of the 1st Buttress.

As the ledges are climbed, weaknesses will appear, leading upward to the right, into the bowels of the face. Chose your path. The goal is to reach a series of ledges in the middle section of the face described as the white bands.

There has been much history about this route.  Once, it carried a somber reputation of a fear-inducing North Wall.  However, a couple Californians came to erase that reputation with an afternoon ascent.  In its former state, it provided a great, moderate line up the 3rd buttress.  With the rock fall which changed the first 2 pitches in the late 1990s, this route's start increased in difficulty to the 5.10 R range.

It is demanding both physically and mentally.  The run-outs epitomize what climbing on Hallett Peak is all about, and it has some burly, physical cruxes.  It shares the same start as the\n\nLove Route\n\nand the\n\nEnglishman's Route\n\n.  As with all routes on Hallett Peak, route finding and intricate gear placing skills are important.  See the big white spot with the obvious roof at the top in the picture below.  The Hesse-Ferguson goes up the white spot and climbs through the roof on pitch 3 or so.  The following description is how we climbed the route, although there are many other possible variations to this route on almost every pitch.\n\nPitch 1 - Locate a pink band of rock to the left of a giant, right-facing dihedral.  Climb through the pink band and go up a grassy, right-facing dihedral to a nice ledge with slings available for a belay.  160 feet, 5.6.\n\nPitch 2 - Step left from the belay ledge and face climb up to another ledge.  Step right and continue up a left facing dihedral to a white roof that blocks the way.  The dihedral starts out with a left facing and a right facing side with a crack on both sides, but the right facing side peters out eventually.  Climb around the right side of the roof and make a belay with very small gear.  Alternatively, go straight up the dihedral from the belay ledge until the left facing dihedral is reached and continue up to a belay above the white roof and to the right.  There will be a slung block just below the belay where a retreat anchor has been placed.  200 feet, 5.8.\n\nPitch 3 - Climb a slab up and left, above the belay, to reach the bottom of a giant, left facing dihedral.  Get into the dihedral and climb it to the top, beneath a giant, squared-off roof.  It is possible to belay directly under the giant, squared-off roof.  Climb out the bomb bay roof on the right side, and layback around the outside corner to get to face climbing on the right.  Go straight up to reach a big terrace that is at mid height on the cliff and belay.  30 feet of slab climbing to the dihedral leads to 100 plus feet of climbing from the base of the dihedral, through the roof, and up to the terrace.  5.9 for the roof and 5.8 serious on the slab below the dihedral.\n\nPitch 4 - Climb straight up from the terrace, aiming for a small roof.  The gear up to the roof is decent enough.  Above the roof, either continue up over insanely run out face climbing (yucky) to a belay on a flake, or traverse up and right to join a left facing dihedral on the Culp-Bossier and belay at the top of the dihedral (better).  200 feet, 5.7 serious or very serious depending on the chosen path.\n\nPitch 5 - Continue face climbing up to the base of a white band and belay either at the base of the white band or go down and to the left for a few feet to a better belay.  150 to 200 feet, 5.8.\n\nPitch 6 - Climb up the left side of the white band through some small, acrobatic roofs and a shallow right-facing dihedral, heading to the top.  The only fixed piton on the route is encountered in the first roof.  Belay where convenient. This is the best pitch on the route as we climbed it.  5.9.\n\nPitch 7 - Continue up to the top if the rope ran out on the previous pitch.  5.8, serious.\n\nIt is possible to traverse up and right to join the\n\nCulp-Bossier\n\nfrom the base of the white band at the top of pitch 5.  The entire route contains many variations and most of the pitches seem to be longer than indicated in the Richard Rossiter Rocky Mountain National Park guide to the High Peaks - 1997.  The [Gillett] guide generally matches the same description.  Bring large nuts and a friend.  If your head is on right, this is a wonderful route up the middle of the 2nd buttress.

From the ground, you can see a big, black, right-leaning crack above the white band that divides Hallett in half and to the right of the roof on the\n\nLove Route\n\n.

Expect a bit more loose stuff, though. Perhaps the crowds are also scared away by the 5.10a rating in all the guides--don't be. The crux pitch is clearly easier (all 3 other people I know who've done the route think it is 5.9 at most, and the line we did exactly matched that of the guidebooks), and on average, with the exception of P1, all the pitches feel about a grade easier than the guidebooks' ratings. Overall it feels a tiny bit harder than\n\nCulp-Bossier\n\n. The protection is good but not great; practically all the crux sections are pro-at-your-feet affairs. The upper pitches have wonderfully exposed and juggy 5.8 climbing.\n\nSeveral features should point one in the desired direction to find the start of the route, which is probably the trickiest route-finding of the day. Hike past the start to\n\nCulp-Bossier\n\nand\n\nJackson-Johnson\n\n, to a huge, long, right-facing corner. Several smaller corners exist to the right of this; the route begins in the third corner (all smaller) to the right of this feature. Right of this lies a large white spot in a smooth shield of rock (not to be confused with the much larger site of recent rockfall on the Third Buttress). From here it is quite difficult to tell where the crux pitch goes, but step back well away from the cliff until fixed slings are visible above the P1 corner's top.

The pitch starts up a shallow, RF and right-arching corner, traverses right past a pin (just above a hollow flake) to another shallow, indistinct RF corner, and ascends this, eventually gaining a large, sloping ledge. The ledge lacks good anchors and it is best to continue into the next pitch with a 60-meter rope to find a better belay. Another option is to set a hanging belay below the sloping ledge where the crux crack dies out.\n\nP3 - climb nebulous, somewhat dicey 5.6 corners up and slightly right to another ledge (as noted above, best to stretch the crux lead to here). Traverse right along this ledge and set a belay after a long pitch (about 100 feet or so right of a huge, right-facing corner, with a wide crack, that marks the right edge of the huge pillar on\n\nJackson-Johnson\n\n).\n\nP4 - traverse up into a right-facing, left-leaning 5.5 corner, and climb that to a belay near its top (above a prominent hollow flake on the right, but still below the top of the\n\nJ-J\n\npillar to the left)--another long pitch.\n\nP5 - traverse right (somewhat loose) to a roof, and follow the obvious juggy weakness through and up to a belay ledge (100 feet, 5.8).\n\nP6 - nice 5.8 leads straight up before the crack system jogs considerably right to a belay on a large sloping ledge, fantastic exposure the whole way.\n\nP7 - continue up the right-leaning system, 5.7 or 5.8, for a long but not sustained pitch ending in a broken area on the very edge of the Second Buttress (good views of the Slit).\n\nP8 - cut sharply back left on easy but loose ground and finish with neat climbing through an obvious 5.6 notch (the left and larger of two).

Head left or downhill, following the cliff top.  Look for cairns.  The cairns lead to a set of chain anchors.  One 100 foot rappel will lead to ground that is safe to scramble down.  Follow cairns down towards the low spot in the ridge.  Look for a very faint path leading off to the left.  There should be cairns marking the way.  At all costs avoid getting into the obvious snow or scree gully that is in front of you.  Eventually a small col will be encountered where the option exists for easily dropping into the ugly snow or scree gully mentioned before, or turning to the left and having a delightful trot down ledge systems that make up the lower section of the 1st Buttress.  Cairns mark most of the way and after a while it becomes obvious which way to go.  This descent brings you back out at the base of Hallett Chimney.","protection":"Take along a standard RMNP rack.

This book and its companion volume to the Estes Park region are well worth getting. Both provide previously unpublished routes, up-to-date descent info, grade indexes, and nice presentations. They are very professional and polished books. I like carrying both Gillett and Rossiter route descriptions along, sometimes a 2nd opinion is welcome.\n\nGillett certainly talks this route up, so I felt I should go and check it out. While I didn't think that it was as great as Gillett obviously does, it would make a good alternative to the well traveled Culp-Bossier (which undoubtedly motivated Gillett's assessment at least partially.) I'm not sure if it's better than Love (haven't done that one), but it's about as good at\n\nCulp-Bossier\n\n.\n\nFrom the start of\n\nLove Route\n\nand\n\nCulp-Bossier\n\n, step up left to a grassy ledge (left of the huge, right-facing corner). You will see a couple right-facing dihedrals above.\n\nOR, per\n\nDoug Haller\n\n: before reaching the base of Culp Bossier locate a large flat roughly square grassy patch. The patch is down and lookers left of the start of Culp Bossier by about 75 feet. Locate the left most large, right-facing dihedral. It does not look like much. At the top, or skyline will be a second right-facing dihedral in sharp profile. This is the upper corner on pitch 2.\n\nP1. Climb/wander to the bottom of the left right-facing dihedral (5.6).\n\nWith a 60m rope, you should be able to reach the base of the second pitch. The only indication of past climbers are some flattened grass and an old piton at about 160 feet. Belay in the corner below the roof where the dihedral angle reclines.\n\nP2. Climb the dihedral above. Avoid the roof by climbing the thin face on the left\n\nor a second more vertical corner system with somewhat strenuous moves midway\n\n. The upper half is nice stemming and a dirty crack.\n\nAfter exiting the corner, climb up and the hard left below a steep headwall.  Look for the second of two trees above which you'll find slung block. Belay here.\n\nThis is a great pitch (5.8).\n\nP3. I tried climbing the headwall directly, but after ripping off a pizza pan-sized flake, I got a little freaked, backed off, and stepped left to bypass the steep stuff. I recommend the latter (5.5). OR, c\n\nlimb up ledges passing three trees along the way.  Look for a forth tree with an old button head bolt at the base or belay at a convenient spot.\n\nP4. Climb a shorter easy pitch up to a ledgy area, and set a belay at a comfortable spot (5.4)\n\nat the left side of a pillar\n\n.\n\nP5. Above you should see a large pillar (~100 foot high) on the face. Climb the left side of this to a small ledge at a right-facing and -leaning corner/flake.\n\nLook for a single button head bolt on the right side of ledges and belay here.\n\nThis is another fantastic pitch. (5.7)\n\nP6. Things get a little confusing here. Climb the flake/corner above to where it bends back left. From here, break out right across the face and belay wherever you can get a good anchor. This is a shorter pitch.\n\nOR\n\nclimb\n\na wide face consisting of knobs and intermittent cracks for about 100 ft. Aim for the skyline where the angle of the cliff decreases and several flakes are visible.  Belay here or with a longer rope, continue up to more comfortable stances and better gear on P7 (5.7) P6 and P7 can be combined with a 70m rope.\n\nP7. This is the mental crux of the route, and is something of a route-finding challenge. From my partner's A5 belay, I ran it out straight up mostly unprotected and steep 5.7+ ground towards an obvious roof/overlap. I didn't protect the step over the roof because I didn't trust the rock that much. Shortly past this, you will reach a small ledge. Follow a right-leaning corner/ramp up to the bottom of an obvious, left-facing corner. (5.8ish, standard Hallett death pitch).\n\nOR c\n\nontinue up the face following the line of least resistance and best gear. After about 30-40 ft the angle reclines and a small tree or two appears on the ledges to the left. Continue up to gain a ledge below a large flake. Right of the flake locate an old pin in a thin crack. Belay here. (5.7) You can combine P6 and P7 with a 70m.\n\nP8. Climb the corner, run it out across a nice 5.8- face, trend left, then hop up a steep left facing corner to the right. If rope drag hasn't stopped you yet, go to the summit. Otherwise, belay, and do one more brief scramble/pitch to the top.\n\nOR above, locate a roof ending in a dark black corner at the right. Aim for the corner where the roof and the right wall intersect. Climb the slab placing gear in cracks and flakes to reach the right side of the exit corner. Here look for a small, steep, right-facing corner with several pins. Make technical face moves, and step left to the end of the roof. Place gear or clip ancient fixed pins. Climb the last few feet below the roof up and right to gain the exit of the roof-corner system. Pull out and over the roof to gain a ledge and slab. Follow the slab upward or stay right in an arching corner. Pass a short headwall to gain the summit. Watch for loose rock and use long slings to avoid rope drag\n\nYou will cross over the\n\nLove Route\n\non P6. The Gillett topo doesn't show the pillar on P5, but the belay point is accurately depicted. His written description of P6 didn't jive with our experience, but our climb pretty much matched the topo. Also, Gillett and Rossiter describe somewhat different lines for the\n\nLove Route\n\n.\n\nOnce on the summit, head east down the ridge for a couple hundred feet. Stay close to the crest, and near the east side of the First Buttress (the route is on the Second Buttress) you will come to a bolted rappel (could use a modern bolt). One rope will get you to a second short rappel, or a 60m rope will get you to easy scrambling terrain. Scramble down the gully for a few hundred feet. Then, head left over a rise, and aim for a scree gully. Follow this to the base of the Hallett Chimney (between 1st and 2nd Buttresses.) If you racked up here in the morning (near the mossy area) you won't need to walk the couple minutes back up to the base of the routes.","protection":"1 set RPs, 1 set nuts, 1 each TCUs and cams to #4 Friend.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"2EdaTXhMWb6xkIzFD+IFLw==","name":"Anderson-Magill","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Tod Anderson, Rich Magill","type":{"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.686,40.3033]},"left_right_index":23,"mp_id":"105759159","mp_crag_id":"105744829","climb_id":"2EdaTXhMWb6xkIzFD+IFLw==","areaRef":"4ZXZizSiXROmT3jcFPy1xA=="},"content":{"description":"On the right side of the third buttress locate a left-facing dihedral on the upper part of the wall.
