It is not a far fall, but there are boulders on the floor of the cave and at head-level.","location":"100 yards past the trail-side boulders, Cove Over will be visible off the trail to the right, (left of Both Sides of the Spectrum) slightly hidden behind a tree. Climb up over a small boulder into the cave.\n\nStart on a long jug rail with matched hands and heel hooks deeper into the cave. Keep bumping all limbs as far left as you can. Move your left hand out to a small shelf, then bump your left hand to top, or leave it on the shelf. Rotate 180 degrees your left foot onto that shelf, with right in the little pocket between starter rail and left shelf. Roll your left foot up to a sketchy and difficult, mantle top-out.\n\nDo not use any part of the \"Both Sides of the Spectrum\" Boulder to your right."},"__v":0},{"_id":"DAklX9ywUFid0zF04oabIw==","name":"Cove Hang","yds":"V5-","grades":{"yds":"V5-","font":"6C","vscale":"V5-"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"alpine":true,"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.63111,40.3549]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"110269310","mp_crag_id":"110268742","climb_id":"DAklX9ywUFid0zF04oabIw==","areaRef":"emqo0hq6Un+IZJEMcuzBVw=="},"content":{"description":"To be edited in.","protection":"To be edited in.","location":"To be edited in."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,a7f78b9b-9983-50f2-93a6-1995d0e3d6c7,27f96443-f5b6-544d-9e4e-fe91aa34c455,72c58159-3e47-5c62-9e74-741c7d6fd325,7a6aa8d2-1aba-527f-8864-910c72ecc157","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","RMNP Bouldering Areas","RMNP Bouldering Miscellaneous Areas","Moraine Park Boulders (aka Fern Lake Trail/The Pool/Arch Rocks)","Hanging Arete Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V5-"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.63111,40.3549]},"bbox":[-105.63170006787398,40.35445033981814,-105.63051993212603,40.355349660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110268742","area_id":"emqo0hq6Un+IZJEMcuzBVw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:52.453Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:23.019Z"}
