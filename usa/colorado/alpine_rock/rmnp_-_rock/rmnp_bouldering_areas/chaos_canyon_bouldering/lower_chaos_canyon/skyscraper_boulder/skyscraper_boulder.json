Do a long committing reach from two crimps to a jug and a crimp.  Get your hands switched and then go to the arete for the right hand.  Get your right foot up and stand up to reach the lip.  Whew.\n\nThis climb has several stances though reversing the moves once one has gotten to the high stance is almost impossible.  That said, not recommended for those without highball climbing experience.","protection":"Lots of pads and people or no pads.  It might not be worth it if you fall from the top.  If the snow has melted the landing is rocky and there is one tree that is exactly where you would land.  I've given the route an X rating for when there is no snow.  Certainly safer with snow.","location":"Start almost in the center of the Skyscraper Boulder and climbs up and right to a stance.  Continues to the arete.  Easy downclimb off the back."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,a7f78b9b-9983-50f2-93a6-1995d0e3d6c7,5cebbc0d-7708-5b60-89c8-c85ff2793839,2d074737-9a1c-5a82-a380-0e55e901fb72,3a684103-e3e2-5b0c-b945-61f5321a61a5","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","RMNP Bouldering Areas","Chaos Canyon Bouldering","Lower Chaos Canyon","Skyscraper Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.66069,40.30479]},"bbox":[-105.66127962991992,40.30434033981814,-105.66010037008009,40.30523966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106627218","area_id":"OmhBA+PiWwy5RWH1MhphpQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.66127962991992,40.30434033981814],[-105.66010037008009,40.30434033981814],[-105.66010037008009,40.30523966018186],[-105.66127962991992,40.30523966018186],[-105.66127962991992,40.30434033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:52.453Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:12.661Z"}
