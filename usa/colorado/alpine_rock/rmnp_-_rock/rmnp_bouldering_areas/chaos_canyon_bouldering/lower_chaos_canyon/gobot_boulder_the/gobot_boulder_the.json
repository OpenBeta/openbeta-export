Bring alcohol!\n\nBeta:  Start matched on the well chalked jug, high right foot, cross left hand to crimp and stretch, stretch, stretch out the the crimp next to the starting jug on autobot.  Swing your feet over and heel hook the square cut.  Lock off and reach to the tooth.  Match feet, release heelhook.  Work you feet over to a big drop knee on the left side of the wall.  (This is my crux).  Big dropknee,  reach the pinch with a good thumb catch, right foot on the crimp that you locked off own to reach the tooth.  Right foot up to higher drop knee, lunge for the \"jug.\"  Match jug, left foot backstep on the tooth and reach to a really cool sloping pinch.  Right foot by your right hand on the jug, reach up to a bad pinch with your right hand.  Put your right foot on the \"jug\" and then dyno for the good knob on the rail.  Match and dyno again for the horn.","protection":"A few pads and two spotters. The dyno(s) at the top could potentially but you in the crevasse behind the flat ledge.
