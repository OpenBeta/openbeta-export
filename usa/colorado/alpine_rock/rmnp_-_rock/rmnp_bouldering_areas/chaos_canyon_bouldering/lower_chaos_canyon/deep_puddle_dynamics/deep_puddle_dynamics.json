An absolute classic, perhaps the best 9 in the Park!  Start on the UNDERCLINGS!  Confirmed with DG.\n\nBeta.  Start on the underclings.  Negotiate a match on the square cut sloper and reach up to a suprisingly good (but small) crimp.  Left foot up on a small point, toe hook underneath the roof and hit the first sloper left-handed.  Reset the toe hook higher and bump to a better sloper.  Match.  Release Toe hook, right foot on square sloper and go up to another sloper.  Left foot on the large sloper feature out left.  Reach up to a decent gaston.  Match feet on the square cut sloper.  Right foot on a loose block (yes in wobbles) either bicycle with your left underneath (or use the higher block if you don't like the loose block) and reach up to a decent crimp/pinch.  Left drop knee hard on the second sloper and reach a slopey gaston above the roof almost parallel to the your left hand.  Bump to good holds.  Move left to a good hemhock.  You can get a knee bar here and shake.  Pull up to the second lip and traverse the boulder to the left.   Pumpy.\n\nFour stars for perfect landing, great movement, good holds, and aesthetics of the line itself.","protection":"2-3 pads, spotter(s).","location":"Head \"up canyon\" (but moderately downhill) from Tommy's Arete hopping talus for about 100 yards."},"__v":0},{"_id":"3Jn7ZZLqUlmiPax0DdBLkg==","name":"Deep Puddle Arete","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"alpine":true,"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.66069,40.30479]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"112006390","mp_crag_id":"106476130","climb_id":"3Jn7ZZLqUlmiPax0DdBLkg==","areaRef":"/2XoSfdOVHGWyxEIJZ0PVg=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the left side arete.","protection":"A couple of pads.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,a7f78b9b-9983-50f2-93a6-1995d0e3d6c7,5cebbc0d-7708-5b60-89c8-c85ff2793839,2d074737-9a1c-5a82-a380-0e55e901fb72,ff65e849-f74e-5471-96cb-1108259d0f56","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","RMNP Bouldering Areas","Chaos Canyon Bouldering","Lower Chaos Canyon","Deep Puddle Dynamics"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V9+"},{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.66069,40.30479]},"bbox":[-105.66127962991992,40.30434033981814,-105.66010037008009,40.30523966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106476130","area_id":"/2XoSfdOVHGWyxEIJZ0PVg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:53.186Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:35.189Z"}
