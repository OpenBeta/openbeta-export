Many good climbers could not connect \"The Move\" and the problem gained notoriety as a result. Daniel Woods linked it in 2007, and a number of repeats have been done since. The grade has been a matter of controversy since the first ascent, but consensus is lowering it to hard V14.\n\nStart low on two small crimps on the right edge of the wall. Move to a terrible hold for the right hand and stab out left for a thin, sharp crimp. This is \"The Move.\" If you can hold this crimp, bump the right hand to a decent sidepull, then a hard move to a higher left sidepull. After this, move up to good rails and the top. After the bottom, the problem backs off considerably with a tall, somewhat fragile finish.","protection":"Several pads and a spotter.
