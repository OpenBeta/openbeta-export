It was originally started with the right hand on a hold under the lip but it didn't really add anything.  Mantle press the shit out of the shelf, and establish on it via some crimps on the right side of the dihedral.  Once you thrutch your way onto the shelf, you can sit down, take a nap, eat some cookies, etc. before stemming your way out of the dihedral and onto a ledge on the left.  From here, you could do a V0 highball topout on licheny and sort of questionable rock, but we decided to just jump off at that point.\n\nI'd give it four stars if it wasn't so lowball.  It's got very unique movement in one of the strangest and most eye-catching features in the Park.  A must-do!","protection":"2-3 crashpads.","location":"This is the obvious dihedral feature.
