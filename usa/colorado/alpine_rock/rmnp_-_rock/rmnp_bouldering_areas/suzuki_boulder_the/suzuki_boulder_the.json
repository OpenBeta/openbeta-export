The movement is unique, varied, and memorable. This is an excellent traverse!  I'm guessing low V9?  Feels harder than any V7 or V8 traverse I have ever done.","protection":"Pads on the rocks below the west face section are essential.","location":"Basically this is a traverse of all four sides of the Suzuki Boulder.  Start with \"The Piano\" a lowball sloper traverse on the north side that is probably V7 by itself.  Once on the northwest arete, above the sit-start handcrack, reach right, grab an undercling, and follow a line of crimps at about eight feet (one of which is a little fragile) straight right to get established on the southwest arete problem.  Reverse the middle of this problem, make a cruxy throw right into an undercling, and finish out the V5 traverse of the south face (with an insane pump).  Towards the end one can cop a full recovery no-hands rest at a cramped stance, either top out on the south face; or for extra value continue straight right on small crimps to a large flake and turn the corner to follow the sloping lip of the east face and top out on the descent slab.  This final section after the no-hands stance is around V4 and with a full recovery before doing it does not really up the difficulty than if one were to simply top out on the south face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,a7f78b9b-9983-50f2-93a6-1995d0e3d6c7,c2c6e92e-5221-5a56-9ce2-32dc5c72b9cd","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","RMNP Bouldering Areas","Suzuki Boulder, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V9-"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.58844,40.3715]},"bbox":[-105.58903021319864,40.37105033981814,-105.58784978680134,40.371949660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106385805","area_id":"wsbpLlIhWlac4jLcXHK5zQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.58903021319864,40.37105033981814],[-105.58784978680134,40.37105033981814],[-105.58784978680134,40.371949660181855],[-105.58903021319864,40.371949660181855],[-105.58903021319864,40.37105033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:51.794Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:11.517Z"}
