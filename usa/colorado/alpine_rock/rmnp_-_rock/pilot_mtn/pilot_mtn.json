Stay right on the ridge for some great exposure, or drift to the left for some slab climbing.  The approach gully is obvious from the tarns below, but if you are approaching after summiting Mt. Alice, descend the SE slopes, and begin traversing south as soon as you can.  Contour around until you are just below the first high point on the ridge extending east from the Divide south of Mt. Alice.  Look for a narrow 100' 4th class gully that is choked with loose rock and delivers you to a saddle with fantastic views of the basin below.\n\nDescend the larger gully to the NE about 150', until you can traverse east on narrow ledges to the start of the route.","protection":"A few wires and slings, if you want gear.  This is a mellow but exposed solo too.","location":"Approach via the Lion Lakes trail,or from the west after a climb of Mt. Alice.
