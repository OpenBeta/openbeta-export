On the vertical wall to the right of this feature is a prominent 300-foot jam crack, which diagonals slightly leftwards until it intersects the broken rock of the Sunshine Ledges route about a third of the way up the left side of Tower 2.  The base of this crack is gained by climbing up and right from near the bottom of the aforementioned grubby groove.  Two more leads directly up the crack complete the climb.  A descent involving downclimbing and two short rappels in the 2-4 gully takes you back to the base; or for a summit experience, it's possible to continue up the Sunshine Ledges.","protection":"Gear to 3\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"2AUfI+OUXuyVTub7GkOrSA==","name":"NE Corner","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Tom Gries and Larry Hamilton, August 1975","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.616,40.3753]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105759933","mp_crag_id":"105746301","climb_id":"2AUfI+OUXuyVTub7GkOrSA==","areaRef":"oW2uIqWKVbSVj0Apg9bd3A=="},"content":{"description":"Except for its crumbling crux, this Tower 4 line is clean, consistent and well protected.  The following description is from the FA.\n\nJust below and right of the summit of Tower 4, as seen from Lake Nanita, are two deep, overhanging 200-foot chimneys.  The route ascends a line a few feet left of the indistinct NE edge of the face, and finishes in the right-hand of the two upper chimneys.  Start by third classing any of several short, 5.7-ish left-facing dihedrals, and on up right a few yards to a stance below a vertical 50-foot dihedral.\n\n1)  Climb this vertical 50-foot dihedral to a ledge; walk right to another, longer dihedral and continue to a ledge at its top.  This second dihedral is fairly prominent from the ground, and is to the right of a very large but less promising dihedral that leads into overhangs halfway up the face.\n\n2)  Go up a ropelength to belay on a ledge below a blocky 30-foot pillar.\n\n3)  Avoid the rotten pillar by moving left into a clean and steep left-facing corner.  This corner has an awkward move past a thistle at its bottom, and an overhanging hand crack at its top.  Continue up easier rock to a belay.\n\n4)  Initially easy climbing leads up and a bit left across some headwalls to a ledge with a cairn.\n\n5)  Continue up and left to reach the base of the final chimney, which begins with a tight, overhanging crack.  Belay higher on a sloping ledge.\n\n6)  Climb the widening chimney past some rotten overhangs (crux), and on to its top.\n\n7)  A few moves above the belayer lead to scrambling and Tower 4's summit.\n\nAn easy descent can be made by going up to the scree gully running S from the uphill side of Tower 5.","protection":"Gear to 3\".","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,1621a45a-659f-5708-9ba0-bc0a295bfc73,a16dae22-a58a-55b4-958f-402983d6dddc","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","RMNP - Rock","Ptarmigan Towers"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.616,40.3753]},"bbox":[-105.61659024648277,40.37485033981814,-105.61540975351724,40.37574966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746301","area_id":"oW2uIqWKVbSVj0Apg9bd3A=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:51.775Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:33.796Z"}
