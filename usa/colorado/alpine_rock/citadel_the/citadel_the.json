Contour along the slopes and marshy areas towads the saddle which sits to the east of the Citadel.\n\nAfter gaining this saddle at 12,400 feet, hike up the Citadel's east ridge. Once below the east summit block, the standard route traverses the cliffs to the WNW taking you to a steep, loose, class 3 gully which provides access to a saddle between the Citadel's two summits. From here, you can tackle the east and west summits. The 4th class crux of the east summit scramble is just above this saddle. Look for a dihedral in the rock which provides access up the cliff section that rises above the saddle. There are solid holds and exposure is minimal. Once above the crux the summit is a short scramble further. Retreat can be downclimbed or rappelled. To reach the west summit, scramble west from the saddle. This summit scramble has a bit more exposure.\n\nA more challenging alternative with more exposure on the east summit is to take on the east summit directly from the ridge, without the WNW traverse to the saddle. The climb up the east summit from this side is more exposed 3rd/4th class.","protection":"In summer, bring a few slings and rap gear if you're not comfortable downlcimbing 4th class.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,fb542ab2-c3ed-51f2-8ca8-b6f64b80edf3","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Citadel, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.9114,39.7153]},"bbox":[-105.91198455961585,39.71485033981813,-105.91081544038417,39.71574966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107952001","area_id":"+1QqssPtUfKMqLb2S4Dt8w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:53.762Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:36.423Z"}
