Climb the final, north-facing couloir (4th Class) to the summit. We stayed climber's right in the couloir and found surprisingly good rock. Though the rock quality improves in the couloir, don't get complacent - a fall here would likely be fatal. Helmets are still highly recommended. After exiting the couloir, a short, easy scramble takes you to the summit.\n\nDescent: reverse the approach.\n\n*Upon descent, North Apostle is easily summited from the saddle, with a quick 10-15 minute walk up 2nd Class terrain. The North Apostle offers beautiful views of Ice Mountain as well as Waterloo Gulch and the surrounding peaks.","protection":"Helmets and an ice axe (depending on snowpack in the couloir).","location":"From the Lake Ann TH, start hiking on the Continental Divide Trail southbound at the Lake Ann TH. After 1.5miles, branch left into the Apostle Basin. As the proper trail ends, weave through the willow field (around 11,300') following social trails. Once through the willows, trend eastward up the steep, grassy hill toward the obvious tower under North Apostle. Wrap around this tower to its west, and continue up the large, ~1,300' tall boulderfield to reach the North Apostle - Ice Mountain saddle."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,191236e4-4d44-55b0-88f4-cf90a69769a4","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Ice Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.43694,38.91459]},"bbox":[-106.43751790757119,38.91414033981814,-106.43636209242884,38.91503966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121213317","area_id":"GRI25E1EVbCI9M+QppdppA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:53.761Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:36.729Z"}
