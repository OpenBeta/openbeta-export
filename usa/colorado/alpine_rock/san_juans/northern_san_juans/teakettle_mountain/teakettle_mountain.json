That being said, make sure you are comfortable at the grade. The rock quality felt worse than Lizard Head due to fewer climbers. One of the handholds started to break off when I pulled on it.","protection":"I got a #5 in down low. You could skip it if you are comfortable in chimneys. For the upper crack, use cames #1 to 3 range. Tricams go well due to the flare. Check the rock quality carefully.

The climb goes very fast (only a few miles and 2,500' round trip) and is completely painless in good conditions. Due to the loose nature of the mountain, most will find this far more enjoyable than the standard summer route.\n\nFrom the Restroom Trailhead (11,300'), head directly uphill. You will quickly (1,000') find yourself in a large cirque to the south of Teakettle. Note the long couloir on the west side of the face: this is your objective.\n\nClimb this couloir on moderate snow (45Â° max) until you reach a short icy and rocky choke point high on the mountain. Climb this, or traverse right and back left around a cliff band. Finish the climb to the summit block. The standard summit pitch is on the SE side of the block and follows a wide crack system for 30' to the summit.\n\nNote: the Yankee Boy Basin road is closed at 9,100' until May 1 every year. Plan accordingly.","protection":"Ice axe and crampons.\n\nMost climbers will be completely comfortable soloing up and down the short, easy, and unexposed summit pitch.

The left line is mostly snow while the other two are mixed.\n\nAt the base of the left couloir, which is split by several rock islands, weave your way up amid fins and spires. I'd recommend hugging the right side as the left sheds more rock. The climb steepens up to perhaps mid-50s degrees minimum near the upper third. Aim for a snow finger and notch at the top.\n\nDownclimb easy snow/scree on the backside of the notch to gain the standard route trail hooking hard right. A quick hike leads to the 5.easy summit block.","protection":"Webbing to replace the summit block if needed and a 30m rope for the summit block. I've never roped for the summit but I think a 0.5 and perhaps a hand-sized piece will protect it. Bring pickets and PCDs on the snow if at your limit.\n\nNote the route is viewable from Montrose and other communities thereabouts. That should give you an idea on conditions.","location":"This route is on the left side of Teakettle's north face. An obvious approach is via Blaine Basin; however, this makes the descent significantly more complicated sans\n\na 2-hour Yankee Boy shuttle, advanced skiing, or steep snow downclimbing. Most would want a supremely early start via this approach, or a camp.\n\nWe accessed the route from Yankee Boy Basin by climbing up and over the Cirque/Teakettle col. Moderate grass, snow and talus led to the col. A couple moves of chossy 4th Class downclimbing took us to a 500 foot descent and traverse on moderate-steep snow to the base of the route. Depending on snow levels, some may want a short rope to get off the col."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,64f7d38a-5f26-57d1-b23a-b941f84f7cf9,5a864bf9-39f8-57d3-b07f-819304b228a9,86f7199b-696f-5d9b-a1b2-aa346929827b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","San Juans","Northern San Juans","Teakettle Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"},{"count":3,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":3,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":3,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":3,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.762,38.00061]},"bbox":[-107.7625706317079,38.00016033981813,-107.76142936829211,38.001059660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111998496","area_id":"hvcZm2lvXZuhsqo0aSmCew==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.7625706317079,38.00016033981813],[-107.76142936829211,38.00016033981813],[-107.76142936829211,38.001059660181866],[-107.7625706317079,38.001059660181866],[-107.7625706317079,38.00016033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:53.759Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:44.809Z"}
