Climb 90 feet into an alcove, 5.3.\n\nPitch 2\n\n: continue straight up from the alcove in a chossy crack system; then veer right to a series of mantels. The upper mantel is the crux and is protected by a fixed pin (more of a mental placement). Continue up the ridge on hollow spires to more solid rock, 5.6 PG-13.\n\nPitch 3:\n\nfrom the top of the 5.6 pitch, start down a class 3 ramp to a notch. Climb out of the notch, class 4, to the middle summit. The eastern summit is reached by crossing an exposed gap and then a short scramble to the summit, 180 feet, 5.0.\n\nFor the descent, use a slung boulder and solution pocket to rappel 80 feet off of the north side of the tower from the top of the second pitch.","protection":"- Single 60m rope.\n\n- BD cams #0.75 - 6.\n\n- 4-6 double length runners.\n\nTo sew it up, one could bring double #5.
