This is the best rock on the route.  Three pitches will get you to the top with the second pitch being the 5.9 crux, but 99% of the climbing is around 5.6/7.  Excellent slab climbing.  Upon reaching the top of the initial slab wall about 400-500 feet of very loose, class 3 scrambling brings you to the \"choss bubbles\", a strange, bubbly-looking formation of gravely granite.  One pitch of 5.7R will be enough to surpass this strange little section.  It's R-rated for the few legitimate placements and the fact that it's like climbing on small marbles.  After this section is another 400-500 feet of class 3/4 scrambling on extremely loose terrain.  We chose to simul-climb this portion as a safety precaution.  After this ridiculous bullshit, you've summited.  Yeah.  I gave this route one star for the initial, fun slab pitches, otherwise this route blows. Have fun!","protection":"Set of cams from 0.5 inches to 2 inches and a set of stoppers.","location":"The route ascends the longest section of the North Face directly to the summit.
