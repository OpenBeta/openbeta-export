Belay off boulders just above the crack.  Hop 50 feet around the base of the first tower and either rappel or downclimb (5.2, 30 feet) a gully to the east between towers 1 and 2.  Set up a belay with medium stoppers.  Climb easy fingers to hands to blocks to top of second tower (5.6, 60 feet) and belay off a slung boulder with a relic piton.  Rappel to saddle between tower 2 and Index off a slung block (30 feet).  The first 25 feet of Index are about 5.6ish and easy to protect.  Enter a small alcove and contemplate the the 25 feet of 5.9ish vertical #5+ Camalot OW above.  Climb it to the fantastic and elusive summit.  The rock is perfect.\n\nTwo pitons off the backside act as summit anchors or you could easily sling one of the summit boulders.  Do a single rappel off the backside pitons to the saddle.  Another rappel from the saddle off pitons to a large grassy ledge on the west side.  A final rappel off a sturdy rock pinch will get you back to your packs.","protection":"A single set of Camalots #0.3-#3.\n\n1-3 #5 Camalots for the upper OW.\n\nMid-sized stoppers.\n\n1 set of Gear4Rocks plastic stoppers.\n\n.380 Kel Tec?\n\nBigbro's work for the OW, but stick with #2s and 3s.  #4s do not fit and are useless.
