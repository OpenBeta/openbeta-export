It has 4th class climbing for approximately 1,000 feet up slabs.  Once you hit the upper headwall, you have a lot of options.  The climbs look easier on the left side of the wall and seem to get harder and steeper to the right side.  The rock on this upper wall can be very good.","protection":"Bring a full range (single set) of stoppers and cams up to #3 Camalot. Pitons were very helpful (3 were left fixed due to partner not having a hammer) and would recommend bringing, at least to assure good anchors.  There are lots of crack systems, but there are also very blank sections where there always seems to be seams for knifeblades.","location":"This ascends the broad face to the east of the prominent north ridge.
