Â Scramble about 100 feet to the notch. The first crux is to climb out of the notch and felt like a few moves of low 5th Class. Immediately above the difficulties we found the cairn. After that, the route goes at approximately Class 3-4; however, there were a couple sections near the top of low 5th Class if you tried to stay the ridge proper. The very last difficult looking section can be bypassed on the left (west).

At this point, climb up a steep, left-facing slab/dihedral and then 4 pitches up a chimney crack behind a great plate. Traverse 60 feet right (west) below the 'plate glass' smooth slabs and then 90 up feet via a crack in a left-facing dihedral with a small overhang at the top (5.7). Three long pitches of 3rd and 4th lead to snow and then up left (east) to a 'pass' climbing on dirt or mud.
