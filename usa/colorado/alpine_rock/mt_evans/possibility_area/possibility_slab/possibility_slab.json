This route is certainly sustained and spicy friction slab at its finest!\n\nP1: (5.11c PG, 35m)\n\nStart at the far right of the wall just under a ledge. Climb up to the ledge and clip the first bolt about 25 feet up. From here, follow four more bolts through thoughtful, techy movement. Execute a few well-protected, desperate moves before gaining a no hands rest on a little ledge (optional, poor 0.3 or 0.4). From here, follow up four more spaced out bolts through improbable and exciting moves to a crescendo just under the belay ledge. This last half of the pitch would likely be a difficult and committing onsight.\n\nP2: (5.10b, 35m)\n\nFrom the anchor ledge, follow bolts and intermittent gear to the blocky mini-overhang directly above. Lots of fun underclings and an easier slab make this an enjoyable pitch.
