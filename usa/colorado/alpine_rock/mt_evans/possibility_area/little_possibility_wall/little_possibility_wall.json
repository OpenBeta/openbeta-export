More accurately, the S is made up of two separate curving cracks. This creates a fun, mid-wall, crack switch crux.\n\nPitch 1: follow easy broken terrain up to the bottom of the S crack where the wall steepens.\n\nPitch 2: climb the S, do the crack switch, then avoid the roof by cutting left around it via a diagonal crack system.

If anyone knows the original name of this route, please update this post. The placeholder name \"Batshit Crazy\" was chosen due to the generous amount of excrement one must navigate at the crux.... Bat turds aside, this would be an excellent route after a good pressure washing.\n\nPitch 1: from a central point at the bottom of the Little Possibility Wall, pull over some big blocks to get onto an easy slab, then follow the path of least resistance up and right toward the left-facing corner under the big roof that is a main feature on the wall. The climbing is about 5.6 until the roof. Go light on the gear placements in the corner to reduce rope drag for the 5.8 crux here. Follow a right-traversing finger crack rail around the roof, then mantel up onto a dusty pile of marmot feces on a small ledge at a little alcove.\n\nPitch 2: a few moves up and left will take you to a nice 5.7 crack that you can ride to the top.","protection":"A single rack is fine.
