Evans.\n\nStart sitting on a sloper jug right of an incredible vertical rail all the way at the bottom of the wall. Move left to the rail, and climb through several insecure and technical moves to a redpoint crux gaining a sidepull jug in the middle of the feature. Rest up, and try not to fall off of the final 15 feet, for the climbing is still quite insecure. Though the final half is probably only V8 or 9, the uniqueness of the moves and committing nature make it very serious from the ground.\n\nThis line is best done from late April-early June, for the snow landing keeps the boulder from turning into a mini-sport climb. Several pads are necessary, so make sure there are some stashed or plan accordingly. This line has become world famous due to its height, short season, cryptic-ness, and perfect rock up a singular line on the wall.","protection":"At least 6 pads in the early season and many more for the bold trying it later than June.","location":"It is at the top of Area B about 15 minutes upcanyon from Dali. At Area B, locate a massive, blank roof facing downcanyon about 50 yards below the cliffs. Sunseeker is behind this roof in a nice, little room seemingly meant for staging a single, perfect line. Itâ€™s also 5-10m uphill from the B-Seam (V4)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,c6051197-c75e-5ab8-98ca-5474c5cb2597,1dbd118d-ede2-53d8-b82d-62ea5fe71ab5,fb61eeea-fce2-5f66-b9e7-683e2a071197","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Mt.
