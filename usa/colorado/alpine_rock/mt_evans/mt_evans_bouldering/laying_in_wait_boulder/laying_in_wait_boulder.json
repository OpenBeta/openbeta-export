It is also utterly classic with some commiting moves high off the deck.  Climb the obvious scoop/slab using pockets, slopers, arete features, and some non-existent feet to the summit of the boulder.\n\nYou will want cool conditions for this one, so plan your arrival accordingly.  In the fall, it stays in the sun until about 3pm.\n\nThere are some pretty good videos out there on the web with beta for the problem.  Take those videos with a grain of salt, however, since they exaggerate both the steepness of the problem, as well as the size of the holds.","protection":"Several pads.  Spotters are recommended since unexpected falls are likely from the insecure moves high on the problem and the landing slopes downhill slightly.  The little slab at the base could be an issue for unusual falls.  You're never quite sure how falls are going to turn out since the problem is considerably less than vertical.  That said, I've fallen from high on the problem several times and always cleared the slab at the base.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,b8bc6400-2efc-577d-b6a6-c5367641fd44,c6051197-c75e-5ab8-98ca-5474c5cb2597,1dbd118d-ede2-53d8-b82d-62ea5fe71ab5,0d927d91-a1a6-59da-ac8a-99f5ceacc17d","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Alpine Rock","Mt.
