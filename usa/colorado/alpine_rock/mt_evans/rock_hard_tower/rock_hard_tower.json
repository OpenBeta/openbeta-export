Start on a large jug rail, and then squeeze and heel hook your way to a difficult move pulling over the lip. The difficulty may be dependent on arm length, but the pillar never gets wider than about five feet. The best belay spot is a small ledge directly below the route. There is a small 3rd Class scramble to get down to the belay ledge.\n\n*A general note: this is a new area that has not been trafficked much. There is a lot of loose rock in the area (although the route is fairly clean). Use caution on the approach, and maintain situational awareness while climbing here. If you fall from the belay ledge, there is potential to tumble 500+ feet. As Rock Hard sees more traffic it's likely to become an ultra-classic climb as it is both aesthetically pleasing and climbs very well.\n\nPosting this information on Mountain Project will no doubt increase the climbing traffic in this area. Please climb at your own risk, and be familiar with alpine style climbing and conditions before attempting to venture to this area.","protection":"2 bolts and a 2 bolt anchor.
