Navigating the beta and fighting the pump is the key, or you'll see a drop in your portfolio. A fun start leads to the steep and cryptic crux, which is followed by pumpy moves to the anchors.\n\nThe line was originally poached after being red-tagged following its development; however, a key hold at the crux broke off afterward making the beta different and more difficult. While I didn't get the FA, this route has been a real gift for me. I've been working it off and on for over a year, and with the recent send, it marks some of the most difficult climbing that I've been able to string together. I'm not super familiar with the 5.12 end of things, but other ascentionists have compared it to the\n\nEye of the Tiger\n\n(at the main wall) in difficulty, and it took me way more tries than\n\nMufasa\n\n(at Mill Creek Block) which I thought may be soft for .12a.
