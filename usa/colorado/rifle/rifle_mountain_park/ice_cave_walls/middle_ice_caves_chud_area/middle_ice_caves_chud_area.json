Beyond ratings, this route has amazing rock, great movement, and is one of the best bouldery 12+ routes in the canyon.  If this thing ever gets bumped to 13a, it will see more ascents.\n\nShort and powerful, Monster Magnet packs the majority of its difficulty into a devious 20 foot V7 boulder problem.  Enjoy a small rest, and then navigate through some pumpy slopers, sidepulls and pinches to the top.","protection":"Five quickdraws plus 2 for the anchor.
