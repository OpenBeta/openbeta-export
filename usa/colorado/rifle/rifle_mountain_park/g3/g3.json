The climb is marred somewhat by an unfortunately difficult boulder problem start that guards 3-star 5.10 climbing on the upper headwall.\n\nBegin below a leaning dihedral/arete, with powerful, insecure liebacking up the leaning corner.  Work the right hand up the arete to a long reach to a jug.  Move left and mantle the ledge for a no-hands rest at the 3rd bolt.  From here the climbing is more like mid-5.10, easing as you ascend.  Float the beautiful panel with a rising rightward traverse to the arete, and then back left to another good ledge and shake.  A short easier-than-it-looks bulge leads to a juggy diagonal crack.  One more hard-ish move exits the crack, where 2 more bolts of jugs end at the chains.\n\nI wonder which guitarist this one's named for?","protection":"12 bolts to 2 BA, currently sporting fixed biners.
