After resting, there is another 25 feet super powerful clips and awkwardly oriented sidepulls.  These underclings bring you to a difficult move that establishes you on the headwall.  With your power fading, fight through a few more surprisingly hard, technical moves on less steep terrain to the anchor.\n\nThis route has my vote for the hardest, most perplexing 13d in the canyon.  So, if you don't have the strength to do the moves and grey matter to figure it out, just move on.\n\nTwo kneepads are useful on this route.","protection":"Bolts and a two bolt anchor.","location":"This is to the right of\n\nDumpster Barbeque\n\n."},"__v":0},{"_id":"jb9jglkaU2qvTayguwe6eQ==","name":"The Glue Fairy (Under The Gun)","yds":"5.13","grades":{"yds":"5.13","french":"8a"},"fa":"Pete Zoller","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.69103,39.71467]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105754306","mp_crag_id":"105745516","climb_id":"jb9jglkaU2qvTayguwe6eQ==","areaRef":"VZUbNKp8WYm9WCe3Q/5P0A=="},"content":{"description":"This is an interesting route -- it was modified, with some fairly liberal gluing (a piece or two of talus mounted to the wall) but the glue dried up and the rocks fell off, returning the route to its natural state of very hardness.\n\nIt is one route left of\n\nDumpster Barbecue\n\nand travels out the horizontal roof on pockets to a desperate lip encounter and the former home of the glue-rocks.

It is common to stick clip either the first or second bolt or both for rope management purposes. Since this is basically roped bouldering there's no need to chastise yourself if you start with the second bolt pre-clipped.\n\nBegin in the center of the cave and crank through the undercut bottom on blocky features. The good blocks soon run out and a crimpy move takes you to the \"cigarette pack\" just below a fist-sized hole in the rock. Milk the hole, clip again, and fire through a finishing sequence that takes you left to a good pocketed seam, which then leads back up and right to the anchors.\n\nThough notably short, this route is continuous and powerful, more akin to the bouldery routes at Hell in American Fork than anything else. Maybe that's why Utah climbers often bee-line it for the Crystal Cave after getting bouted at the Project Wall or the Arsenal ;)\n\nThe name derives from a morbid incident in which a deranged sociopath killed an elderly couple in Las Vegas in order to steal their RV. En route to Denver he decided to dump the bodies, burning them up in the trash dumpster at the Rifle rest area by I-70. He was later caught in Denver, still driving the RV.","protection":"6 quickdraws and a short rope.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"/BWln/UyWaK23l5pShdSyg==","name":"Astro-glide","yds":"5.12c","grades":{"yds":"5.12c","french":"7b+"},"fa":"Hank Caylor, Mike Freischlag","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.69103,39.71467]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"105753913","mp_crag_id":"105745516","climb_id":"/BWln/UyWaK23l5pShdSyg==","areaRef":"VZUbNKp8WYm9WCe3Q/5P0A=="},"content":{"description":"This is the leftmost route in the Crystal Cave and climbs out the left side of a chossy bowl onto a mini-headwall of blocky stone.
