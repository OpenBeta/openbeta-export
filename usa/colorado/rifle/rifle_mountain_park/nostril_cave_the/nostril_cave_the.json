Unfortunately, it's also one of the most manufactured.  A pure power-endurance climb, with each move a little harder than the last, this route feels easy until you start putting it all together.\n\nLocated on the far right side of the Nostril Cave, Yellowcard climbs directly out the cave, ending at a set of chains above the lip.  Since the first bolt is easy to reach, and the second bolt is poorly placed, most people stick-clip the first two bolts.  Expect some tough clips.  To avoid hitting the ground, an attentive belay is also recommended on this route.  A 50m rope will get you back to the ground.","protection":"7 quick draws, plus two [for the] anchors.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"cADUV0dOV7K1cDJ/qrHJmA==","name":"Mr. T","yds":"5.13c","grades":{"yds":"5.13c","french":"8a+"},"fa":"Tommy Caldwell","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.69054,39.71723]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105861398","mp_crag_id":"105746847","climb_id":"cADUV0dOV7K1cDJ/qrHJmA==","areaRef":"gFLZ4B9zV/2UXDvBbgy4sQ=="},"content":{"description":"In contrast to its neighbor, Mr. T climbs a clean, relatively unaltered, minimally-reinforced section of rock through the center of the Nostril Cave.\n\nSlightly easier than Yellowcard, this route slowly builds in difficulty.
