This is endurance climbing at its finest, there are no hard single moves, but putting it all together is where I thought the grade comes from. It could be 5.13a/b, but who knows? This rig has a ton of 4 star movement. A 70m rope barely gets you down.","protection":"Fixed draws.","location":"It is the farthest right route on Meat Wall.

Nevertheless, it is an engaging, sustained line on a perfect vertical wall, tackling 80 feet of some of the most fun limestone climbing in Colorado. There is often a line for this route in the mornings, but if you're willing to come a bit later and climb it in the sun or toward evening you shouldn't have much trouble getting on.\n\n80 Feet of Meat is the first route to your right at the top of the steps and climbs off the left side of a ledge onto the brown face above. Save some guns for the pumpy/funky moves in the exit groove -- it's harder than it looks.\n\nIt is a 25 meter pitch.","protection":"12-14 quickdraws.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,ebe9235e-a40c-5b97-b769-65db0bdd0cdc,22dac198-10d8-5ebf-94d5-6e503a0753a0,40edd3af-e6ca-59fe-a935-cedc239c29ff","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Rifle","Rifle Mountain Park","Meat Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":4,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":3,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":3,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12a/b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":23,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":21,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":21,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.6897,39.72096]},"bbox":[-107.69028460759043,39.72051033981814,-107.68911539240958,39.72140966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745462","area_id":"QO3Tr+bKWf6pNc7cI5wp/w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":23,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:20.939Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:04.994Z"}
