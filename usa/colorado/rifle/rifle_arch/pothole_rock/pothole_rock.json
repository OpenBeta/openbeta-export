This route is very typical of other routes around the arch.  The sandstone has sharp, ridge features and flakes that tend to pull off if you don't handle them gently.  After the first few bolts, the route eases up and it is an easy cruise to the bolts at the top.  There are two bolts without chains.  There is potential for more pitches if one was so inclined to add more bolts.  We named this route in dedication to our dogs, the Fuzzy Babies.","protection":"There are bolts up the whole route.  The harder moves at the bottom are well protected.","location":"See the beta picture for directions.  The route is actually located just to the left of a route bolted with really old, rustic bolts.  To find this route for the first time, it is probably best to stay on the main trail that travels up to the arch.  The trail is approximately 2 km long.  When you get up to the distinct bottom of where the faces meet the scree, turn east and traverse across to the gully and then up to the bottom of the massive on the other side.  The routes are located quite close to the west edge of the massive on the east."},"__v":0},{"_id":"nIiNoG+wVjiczzTk6FYgBA==","name":"Casual Stroll","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"Ned Walker","type":{"sport":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.81512,39.62992]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106929706","mp_crag_id":"106929678","climb_id":"nIiNoG+wVjiczzTk6FYgBA==","areaRef":"nLxWkhsDXwK3TN8LyIn5nw=="},"content":{"description":"This route starts to the right of\n\nFuzzy Babies\n\n.
