Apparently the FA's were hinting at the rock quality. Pitches 1 and 4 were quite nice, but the others have little to recommend them.  Loose, decomposing (kitty litter) granite dooms most of the cracks on the route, and heavy lichen taints the rest.  That said, it is a pretty marvelous route-finding accomplishment in that the route climbs in the vicinity of the steepest, tallest part of Big Rock, yet stays mostly below 5.10.\n\nRecent guidebooks have claimed that the start of this route was destroyed.  Not true:\n\nPitch 1: Climb a low-angle, but blank slab straight up to a small pine tree with slings - clearly visible from the ground.  3 bolts, 5.9, 90'\n\nPitch 2: (possible to link with P1) Climb a fun right facing flake to a nasty rotten chimney/dihedral.  It's possible to climb the slab on the right on better rock.  The dihedral tops out on a large ledge - step right across a slab and belay at a bolt under an overhang just left of the rock scar.  Gear, 5.8, 110'\n\nPitch 3: Climb up right through the scar on low angle rock covered in debris.  Work your way out the left side of the roof (there is a coffin-sized detached block projecting down from the lip of the roof, which my partner was unable to dislodge despite jumping up and down).  Continue about 40' past the lip to belay at the base of the right-angling finger crack.  Gear, save a #5 for the belay, 5.8, 120'\n\nPitch 4: Climb a right-angling finger tips crack up onto a clean slab (both guidebooks mistakenly describe this as left-angling).  Protect with wires and small cams (5.10).  Some of the footholds are exfoliating, which make this exciting.  When the crack ends venture straight up on the face (5.8) to a bolt then head to the left edge of the roof above where the next bolt waits over the lip.  Continue up into a large water groove, traverse left into a protected alcove with bushes and belay at the base of a wide crack. (Thin gear, 2 bolts, 5.10, 200')\n\nPitch 5: Climb the wide crack straight up to an overhang, traverse left around the overhang and belay on gear in this vicinity.  Better belay gear is available before the 'hang, but continuing past it yields a better stance and less rope drag for the next pitch. gear, 5.8, 80-100'\n\nPitch 6:  Climb straight up the left of two bushy cracks.  Don't worry, soon the bushes disappear, at which point the rock turns to shit.  Belay somewhere at the base of the awesome-looking left facing dihedral (a #5 is nice for the belay) gear, 5.8, 80' (possible to link with the previous or next pitch)\n\nPitch 7: Climb the left facing dihedral on initially bad rock that turns to lichen-covered rock.  Where the dihedral heads left into a roof, we found it helpful to traverse left onto the slab to avoid lichen.  Fortunately there are good nuts available in the dihedral (I left two fixed).  Regain the crack at the lip of the roof and belay above on a right angling flake-crack.  Wide and thin gear, save some hand-sized pieces for the belay, 5.9/5.10, 110'.\n\nPitch 8: Climb right, then left on a nice slab crack, then straight up a lichen covered groove/crack that seems too steep to be 5.9.  Stem and hand jam up this thing for 10', then follow a flaring groove up a lower angled slab to a big ledge.  Some hand sized cams are nice for the belay. gear, 5.9+, 120'.\n\nPitch 9: Scramble up low angled slabs with intermittent gear.  Not at all \"unprotected\" as claimed by some guidebooks.  This may be two pitches if you decide to pith it out, or a short simul-climb.  gear, easy 5th class.\n\nPitch 10: Down climb a wide crack/groove thing to a saddle between the summit you're on and the main saddle a wide cam is nice to protect the second on this section (5.6).  Continue left and down through a gully/chimney to a really nice sandy belay alcove.\n\nPitch 11: Climb up a large right facing dihedral via a widening crack to the top of the pedestal.  It is possible also to follow a thin, flaring crack on the slab with better rock and smaller gear.  gear, 5.9, 80'\n\nPitch 12: Climb straight up nice, low angle slabs with intermittent gear to the summit.  Also not unprotected.  Possible to link this with the previous pitch and some simul-climbing.  gear, easy 5th class, 150'?\n\nDescent: Head 200' due East to two short raps, or one approx 150' rap.\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this route to a friend, but if you're a robust South Platte climber looking for a great meandering adventure, you might enjoy this route.","protection":"Quickdraws, slings, one set of cams, and we placed a #5 C4 frequently.

I think 3 people would take forever, and increase the possibility of showering garbage down on your 3rd.\n\nThis is how we broke the route down:\n\nP1 - 100', 5.9. Climb a left-facing dihedral against a smooth, polished, granite slab.  Pro to 3\".  Climb to a small belay tucked into the rock.  There is a decent place to stand and build an anchor.\n\nP2 - 200', 5.9. For us, this was the business, and it starts immediately - use a #5 to protect you getting into the dihedral, which has now grown into an off-width.  This is still facing the smooth, scalloped, granite slab.  Climb to a good belay ledge at a large opening above the slabs.  There is some loose garbage in this big quasi-cavern, but you don't climb on it, and it is easily avoidable.\n\nP3 - 200', 5.7ish. Climb some interesting slabs and a little bit of grub and decomposed rock (again, which you don't climb on, but is around) into where the dihedral grows into a body size + opening.  We went south (climber's right) to go around a large hump, followed by a thin granite ridge with some exposure on both sides, more exposure on the climber's right.  This continues up and then left to beneath the Gumdrop Spire.  Belay on the west side of the Gumdrop.  There is some decomposed garbage below the belay, but again, just loose stuff you don't climb on.  Watch your 2nd, and don't shower any loose stuff down.\n\nP4 - 200' (this can be done with a 165' rope, depending on where you set up your belay at the bottom of the pitch), THIN 5.7. Move your belay to the east side of the Gumdrop, facing the sea of granite slab above you.  See that tiny Star drive anchor 20' above you?  That's your first pro.  From the right hand side, fall/lean forward across the 20' deep, 3'+ wide crack to grab the bomber hands and then CAREfully step over with your right foot.  A fall for your first or second will likely end with them wedged between the two sides of the crack, which would be bad.  After the scary step, traverse left until you can step onto the thin slabs, climb up to the \"bolt\", then continue uphill to the next 2 bolts, which are about 15-20' apart.  About 15' above the 3rd bolt, you can get some gear in a left trending ledge/crack.  The difficulty eases here to 4th class.  Belay at the 2-\"bolt\" hanging anchor, which you can back up with gear in the crack at your feet.\n\nP5 - 200', more thin 5.7. Follow the thin sea of granite up to the bolt, about 15' above you.  Clip this, then run it out 50-60' (easy 5th) to a ledge, then head north/climber's left until you run out of rope.  Build an anchor here.\n\nP6 - 150'+, 5.6? Follow the ridge up a beautiful hands crack until you meet the thin exfoliated garbage flake above you.  Step right and out onto the face, and get gear in the crack to your right.  Climb out and around this bizarre, scalloped, hanging flake, then up to the belay.  You're done.  Enjoy the summit - watch the decomposing garbage around you (you don't climb on it anyway).  Rap off the NE corner.","protection":"We used cams up to 5\".  You could probably use a 6\" if you felt like carrying it.  We didn't find any especially good placements for nuts, so I wouldn't bother bringing any nuts or hexes.\n\nPitch 4 has 3 very old (but well placed) star drive pins/bolts on very old/thin hangers (Leeper hangers!!).  There are 3 \"bolts\" until you can get some gear in on a sloping ledge.  This pitch terminates with a standing belay at 2 more old star drives (these should all be replaced, although they all still feel solid).  Pitch 5 has 1 star drive with a hanger, and then it is quite runout for a bit before you can get more gear in, a good 50-60' above this \"bolt\".\n\nThe rappel has 2 good, fairly recent bolts and hangers.","location":"See the topo for the Big Rock.  It is on the south side of the formation, starting on the highest south saddle that heads SW to the river.  The dihedral (first pitch) is visible only when you are on the west side of the rock.

This eventually (after some scrambing) leads to the base of the route.\n\nTo get off, head to the north summit, then CAREFULLY downclimb (or belay the first down) to the anchors.  2 60m ropes will bring you to the ground.  1 60m rope will get you to an intermediate rap station."},"__v":0},{"_id":"KhmXW2IfX2CYnlH3+otxGg==","name":"Childhood's End","yds":"5.12-","grades":{"yds":"5.12-","french":"7a+"},"fa":"Ken Trout, Eric Winkelman, Brian Hansen, 1984 (with help from Robby Baker & Kirk Miller)","type":{"trad":true,"sport":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.32229,39.1314]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"105762645","mp_crag_id":"105745618","climb_id":"KhmXW2IfX2CYnlH3+otxGg==","areaRef":"eEDBm5xVXfqGmOQVdWEVcw=="},"content":{"description":"Childhood's End nearly caused me to voluntarily quit climbing. Or maybe it was involuntarily. My partner and I found ourselves in the middle of a full blown thunderstorm 10 pitches up this thing. In a feat of amazing poise and, well, luck, he climbed one of the upper pitches, runout almost an entire ropelength and climbing directly through a veritable river of water pouring off the slab... ever wonder how those huge, vertical channels form? A pitch from the top, unsure of whether bailing could even be done from that high on the climb, we decided to anyway.\n\nWe did learn a few things though. First, nothing will take years off your life quicker than multiple double rope raps from star drives. Second, never forget to untie the knots in the ends of your rope before pulling them... Never! Third, if you take a crap on a climb, like my partner did, it will come back to haunt you. Especially if you have to rap the route. The good news? With enough spare biners you can bail off Childhood's End, even from pitch 11.\n\nThe climb is great though, and I'll never forget it. Characterized by runout slab climbing the whole way. I felt every pitch except the 5.12 and 5.10 pitches were PG+ rated, *if* the bolts don't fail. With one exception, every single bolt is either a button-head or a star drive. That includes every belay (most of which are semi-hanging, by the way). Hanging from a pair of ancient 1/4 inch bolts high on the wall, I wondered what would happen if my partner slipped on that 5.7 R section... 100+ feet out with zero gear between him and the belay... Really, it would be a great service to replace all these bolts - at least the belays - with modern hardware. That said, the climb really is quite good. It's a definite adventure to climb such a huge piece of granite outside of RMNP. This area in the South Platte is absolutely beautiful, and chances are you'll be the only ones for miles around. Enjoy!\n\nDouble ropes are an asset on this climb as many of the pitches wander, as would be a few screamers for peace of mind.\n\nP1 & 2: Begin a few meters right of the large boulder at the base of BRCM. Immediately right of this boulder is Fields of Dreams Running Wild - you can see a few modern bolts if you look carefully. A little further right is a very low-angle crack with a tree growing out of it. Climb this for a pitch or two all the way across the face to a two bolt anchor at the base of a short chimney (6-10\" crack) at the right side of the buttress.\n\nP3: Climb the chimney (#4 Camalot down low or #2 a bit higher), then the slab above past 5 bolts. 5.9.\n\nP4: Step right off the belay to a crack. Up this for 20 feet, then step left onto a slab with 3 bolts (5.9).  Or, for a more difficult variation, step up off the belay then sharply left past two bolts and into a water groove. Up this past another bolt to join the slab above (5.11).\n\nP5: Clip a bolt out left, then go around the corner and up the slab past two more bolts, then run it out to the anchor. 5.8 PG13.\n\nP6: From the anchor reach up and clip the first bolt, climb right to gain the arete and a couple of bolts. Move up and left making a long reach (height dependent) to reach a nice ledge with a two-bolt anchor.  Belay here to avoid rope drag.\n\nP7: Climb about 20 feet up to the first bolt. Traverse directly right about 15 feet to the next bolt (hard to spot).  Continue traversing horizontally right over a ridge to locate the next bolt.  From there spot and climb to two bolts up and a third up and left before the anchors for the crux (12) pitch.  Long draws would reduce rope drag somewhat but the zig-zag nature of each pitch makes combining them likely to add rope drag.\n\nP8: The crux. Climb up off the belay to a finger crack and undercling, clip a bolt and head around to the steep right side of the wall, underclinging and clipping bolts along the way. Continue straight up. All in all 11 bolts on this pitch. 5.12-something and easily aidable, but you'll still have to do 10/11 moves between bolts higher up.\n\nP9: A great lead. Head up off the belay, clipping bolts. Perform a difficult step left into a water groove and then continue up on easier ground. Sustained 5.10 and 9 or 10 bolts.\n\nP10, 11, & 12: There are now new 2-bolt anchors at the top of pitches 10 and 11.  From the belay atop P9 climb slabs up 30 meters and left to find a single bolt. This bolt is out left of the direct line by about 20 feet. Next, climb up and right 20 meters to locate a 2-bolt anchor. Either belay or plan on simul-climbing.  P11: Continue up thought provoking slab climbing clipping one bolt before reaching a 2-bolt anchor. P12 has no bolts, no gear, and ends at a large tree or at the top of the cliff.  Keep in mind this is not a trade route, the only gear are the bolts and that crystals snapping of or damp lichen make this a focused if not difficult lead.\n\nAfter topping out, hike/navigate the summit rock slabs and ridge north.  Locate the anchors at the edge of the NE corner of the formation. It is recommended that you set-up an anchor and belay each other down to the fixed rap station. Down climbing the slab solo is potentially fatal. Make two 30-meter raps to reach the ground off bolted stations.","protection":"15 draws/slings.

Pitches 5-8 have some of the best rock quality in the SPlatte. If you’re a face climber, we highly recommend this climb! It truly has something for everyone: undercling roofs, heel hooks, stem corners, slab, and easy OW.\n\nThis climb is currently listed as #4 “Big Aid Route A2” in the Haas guidebook as an unfinished aid climb. Evidence of previous parties was found as high as pitch 3.

I recommend stickclipping the first bolt (a 0.75 or 1 fits in the first pod if you prefer not to use the sticks we left at the base). After the 15 feet of crumbles, traverse out right clipping bolts and intermittent gear. Eventually you’ll come to the traverse's end, then climb the awesome, hanging handcrack. After 20 feet, look left for the anchors. They are guarded by an 8 foot 5.9 slab traverse that's more heady for follower than leader.\n\nP2: 12- Heel Hook in the SPlatte?

The leader will then most likely channel their inner 5.9+, wide climber in the...well wide, semi-awkward crack. The glory of a toprope will allow the follower to mostly stem and slab their way up the face. Find an old anchor, and keep going! Traverse the wide gorge left. Don’t feel ashamed if you throw a leg up and over the ledge while you traverse for the cowboy up experience.

We tried real hard to find a way around this pitch, but the climbing above (pitches 5-8) deemed forging through necessary. This pitch isn’t great (1/5 stars). Climb a vegetated corner up to a vertical dihedral. Climb through occasional good handjam to choss to handjam. Yes...we bolted a crack… but it seemed like whippers on this pitch may rip out parts of said crack, so enjoy the 3 bolts.\n\n***You'll notice a beautiful handcrack flake up and right off the belay. We tried to make this go. The start is crumbly, and the handcrack awesome. There are bolts above this pitch. In order to connect back into P5, it would involve probably 12+/13- friction slabbin'. It's all yours if you want to put in the work!\n\nP5: 5 bolts, 23m (4/5 stars).\n\nGood microcams off the belay set the leader up for the start of the slab adventure! Consider this pitch a warm-up for what's to come! Climb up the groove protected by bolts eventually leading to a decent run to a jug. Gear can be found around the arete to take the spice out of the runout (0.1 - 0.2 size). Continue up 5.8 jugs, and traverse right to the belay on a sloping ledge.\n\nP6: 12- Rainbow Trout Traverse (5/5 stars).\n\n9 bolts, 20m.\n\nClimb straight up off the belay into the corner protected by bolts. Place a cam high in the corner, and start your journey rightwards (we tried going up straight up the dihedral but hit really crappy crappy crappy crappy rock - not recommended, but there are anchors up there). Undercling the crack while pasting your feet on the slab. Every 4-5 feet there are good underclings to be found if my giant tickmarks have faded. Pull up into the corner, and finally find an ok rest below a gently rising roof. Slab and roof climb all at the same time, pulling the roof on the far right side. It is helpful to unclip the last bolt to reduce drag while bringing up your second. Enjoy the fun, hanging belay.\n\nP7: 5.12 The Guardian Slab (5/5 stars).\n\n12 bolts, 32m.\n\nWhile your belayer enjoys that hanging belay, start climbing up 5.8/5.9 fun slab up and left.

Let me know, and I’ll happily buy you a beverage of your choice! Continue up and left slabbin' your way to glory! It’s a really cool position with a steep plunge below the arete to the left. If you’re feeling peachy, combine with the next pitch, if not (like us), stop at the belay. This pitch comes into the sun around 1:30 to 2:00 p.m. in the summer.\n\nP8: 5.9ish? (5/5 stars).\n\n3 bolts, 15m.\n\nThis last pitch felt 5.8/5.9, but we were tired, so it’s somewhere in there. Climb on a really cool position with a dropoff belay the arete to your left and awesome slabbin' to your right. Make a small run above the last bolt to easier terrain eventually to a 2 bolt anchor.\n\nRappel with a 70m rope or continue up and right into\n\nRotten Teeth\n\npitch 9.","protection":"A set of RPs, single set of cams 0.1-.03, a double set of cams 0.4-4, and 10 quickdraws, 5 alpine slings (15 total).\n\nConsider an optional #5 for the wide portion of P3. We brought it up once and then never again.","location":"It is located roughly 500 vertical feet below\n\nShock Treatment\n\n. Bulleit Train is listed as climb #4 in the Haas guidebook.\n\nIf approaching via the west: simply walk past\n\nChildhood's End\n\nand\n\nRotten Teeth\n\n, and walk up the gully until at the base of a prominent, rising roof arch (see the photos).\n\nIf approached from the east, take care to find best way down the loose gully in front of the North face. It's an adventure in itself if you've never tried. Walking down south face gully is much more straightforward but MUCH longer."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,7840c19b-9c55-5dfa-8698-e41575611573","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Big Rock Candy Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":7,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.32229,39.1314]},"bbox":[-105.32286968260895,39.130950339818135,-105.32171031739104,39.13184966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745618","area_id":"eEDBm5xVXfqGmOQVdWEVcw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.32286968260895,39.130950339818135],[-105.32171031739104,39.130950339818135],[-105.32171031739104,39.13184966018186],[-105.32286968260895,39.13184966018186],[-105.32286968260895,39.130950339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:17.244Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:51.084Z"}
