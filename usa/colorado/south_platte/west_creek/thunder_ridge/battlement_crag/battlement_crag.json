A blocky, reachy start leads to the ledges below the concave, bombay chimney.  Make the memorable entrance moves to the chimney and delicately traverse right under the huge roof.  From the blocky perch at the right side of the roof, step up onto the alligator skin face and follow the dihedral to the anchors.","protection":"3 bolts and a light gear rack to 3 inches.  Several slings.  The anchor is two cold shuts at a comfortable ledge. Due to the excessive rat&bat shit, wet wipes are required before you eat your PB&J!\n\nExtra considerations:\n\nBe wary of potential rockfall, try to minimize rope drag, and place gear to protect the second. The 2 bolts at the start eliminate placing gear behind a giant block your belayer may be standing below.  A bolt on the alligator skin face above the roof is in line with a groove that will reduce rope drag/abrasion and will keep the rope off the footholds at the lip.  Feel free to skip the bolts.","location":"This is located on the south corner of the dome and is easily identified by the black, concaved chimney at midheight."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,2ec85bd3-e3df-51a1-ab57-aeccf6a8410b,1ea869d8-0ebe-5e80-91aa-2db42cc3aaf0,6b719f69-5701-5f17-8a7f-2462dffae15b","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","West Creek","Thunder Ridge","Battlement Crag"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.22165,39.20055]},"bbox":[-105.22223025279082,39.200100339818135,-105.22106974720919,39.20099966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106728033","area_id":"a3GfaVcBXxeKfyRi3/rhWw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:11.726Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:50.598Z"}
