In retrospect, however, it is a good route well worth doing in its own right.  Ascending the obvious Southeast flank of Sheeps' Nose (right of Lost in Space) in 4 or 5 pitches, this route will challenge you with moderate routfinding issues, significant but generally easy runout sections, a well-protected 5.8d crux, and few loose rocks here and there.  Your reward is outstanding position, sections of very good climbing, and a spectacular summit.\n\nP1-2:  Many variations.  Keep walking right from the start of Lost in Space, and find the path of least resistance moving up to the small roof break.  Or, you can take the first pitch of Lost in Space, climb the heavily chalked crack above the belay, and traverse straight right past a good-sized chickenhead.  Instead of moving up the arete, keep traversing right until you find a funky belay in a corner underneath the small roof.\n\nP3:  Keep traversing right about 20 feet (difficult pro but easy), until you reach a small break in the roof.  Turn the roof (5.4), and ascend discontinuous cracks up the nice slab above (5.7).  An obvious, if small ledge will appear just when you need it most.  Belay on 3 fixed pins in the shallow dihedral above this ledge.\n\nP4:  Ascend the shallow dihedral above the belay (crux, especially if wet), and keep going on easy but runout terrain until you run out of rope and must belay.  At this point you should be just to the left of the obvious and deep gully that bisects the Southeast face proper.\n\nP5:  Many options, all a bit runout.  The easiest way probably goes at no more than 5.4 up the slabs.

With a short approach through the Poderosa pine and a sunny southern exposure, this route is a year-round classic for everyone.\n\nFrom the parking on Douglas County Rd. 68, hike along a shaded trail up through the boulders to the prominent southeast face in about 15 minutes. Lost in Space begins on the lowest point along the face in its southeast corner and climbs up into a large, right-facing corner near the summit. To start, look for a ledge system with a small pine tree growing out of a right-leaning corner about 75\" off the ground. There are many variations and alternatives to the first pitch.\n\nPitch 1: 5.7 or 5.9, 80'. Look for a 5.7 hand crack leading up and right into an easy 5.5 corner that continues up to the tree at 70', or run it out over the slabs for Cheap Thrills at 5.9. Belay on a comfortable ledge above the tree. If this pitch has snow or ice on it, try\n\nLamb's Prey\n\n, a hand and finger crack 30\" to the right, 5.9-.\n\nPitch 2: 5.8+, 130'. Move above the belay, and traverse right for about 10\" around an arete to gain a steep fingercrack. Follow this crack straight up to some very airy moves with good holds along the arete and into a shallow dihedral above. Continue up for another 20' to a nice ledge and belay.\n\nPitch 3: 5.9, 100'. Head up and left in a thin crack. Where the crack ends (crux), move out onto the face, and make a few delicate moves up the slab. Climb up easier ground to a 5.4 corner above. Scale the corner on large holds and belay on a spacious pedestal above the corner.\n\nPitch 4: 5.7, 150'.
