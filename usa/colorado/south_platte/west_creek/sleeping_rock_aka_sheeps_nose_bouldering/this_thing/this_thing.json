Use these jugs to gain the slopey lip and gun for the finishing jug. Great fun.\n\nDownclimbing options are several but all of them considerable in terms of danger. When I first did this problem I was alone, so I downclimbed the opposite face with some 5.8ish slab moves. If you are there with multiple pads, you may consider jumping off the finish. If downclimbing the opposite face, I would recommend having a friend bring the pads around.","protection":"One backbreaker block threatens the starting moves.
