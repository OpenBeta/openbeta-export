This line offers thoughtful movement and consistency, and sending always seems to give people much more trouble than expected.\n\nFrom an awkward sit start off the unfortunate landing, with hands matched on an undercling/sidepull hold, pull on and move to a slippery rail. Techy crimping on the arete sets up for a long move to an edge in the corner. Drop knees and interesting positions lead to a final throw for the glorious lip jug. Easy topout.\n\nI have left the FA credits blank due to some controversy regarding this one. However, both of the problems’ pioneers did a great job with the vision behind the line.","protection":"Several pads.

A huge right hand cross move leads immediately into Wolf with some extra fatigue, making a low percentage line even harder.\n\nPersonally, I think this line adds some fun moves and a better start to Wolf, but Wolf is already so great it’s hard to say if this is truly a better line. If you can, do them both. It doesn’t matter.
