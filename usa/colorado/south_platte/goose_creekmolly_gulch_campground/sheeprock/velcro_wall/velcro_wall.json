Ten quickdraws are required if doing a single pitch.  6 are required if breaking the climb into two pitches.  There is an intermediate rappel station after the 6th bolt and an upper rappel station.  If you want to climb to the summit, untie from the rope and scramble up easy 4th class terrain or belay your partner from the upper rappel station.  A 60 m rope is sufficient to reach the summit from the upper rappel station.  When rappelling, a 70 m rope will get you from the upper rappel station to the intermediate rappel station, but a 60 m rope will land you one bolt shy of the intermediate rappel station.","location":"The Bolted Route is just north of the large dihedral on the Velcro Wall & just south of\n\nAcid Crack\n\n."},"__v":0},{"_id":"pp8MMuboVvSmdc46CStJ/A==","name":"Acid Crack","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"Ken Trout & Kevin","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.33053,39.18863]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106475286","mp_crag_id":"106475191","climb_id":"pp8MMuboVvSmdc46CStJ/A==","areaRef":"didyJfJLUYS9mm8pKeCMKQ=="},"content":{"description":"Sheep Rock.\n\nMaybe this is as close to a Half Dome as we can get in the Denver area.

I used to think Sheep Rock was probably climbed back then, because Kevin and I found a single angle piton rap at the top of the crack. Later, at the old CMC library on Alameda, I found a Trail and Timberline account of the clubs preference to climb the low angle southwest slabs and then rappel off the summit via Acid Crack.\n\nKevin and I didn't rappel, because we simul-soloed the crack ropeless. Kevin was a Keanu Reeves look-alike; a surfer dude from Cali who showed up ready to learn climbing in 1973. When I told him we could walk off the back, he believed me. Oops! After dropping and climbing, we came on to the realization that there was no walk down the back. So I down-soloed under Kevin with the idea that if he slipped I'd spot him off the excellent finger locks.\n\nWe didn't know that Colorado Springs climbers had been calling the area \"Acid Rock\". It would be no surprise to find out that Earl Wiggins or any number of guys from the Springs did this route earlier and under similar conditions.","protection":"Finger sized stuff.\n\nAcid Crack.
