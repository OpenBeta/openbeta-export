Both ways have the same start, which is a right-angling finger crack.\n\n1) The obvious way is to go up into the chimney. At the wide pod, you can either take this way, or stem across and climb the other crack. Either way, you end up going through a tight squeeze. Once out of the squeeze, continue up the nice but dirty hand crack dihedral to the anchors.\n\n2) If the squeeze scares you, from the finger crack, make a step across and over onto the other side of the leaning block. This way is more strenuous (maybe 5.10?) but saves you from going through the squeeze. After negotiating the overhang, continue up easier ground to a ledge, and from here finish on the same hand crack dihedral.\n\nThis one will be much better when the top half cleans up.

In the song, Joe describes how she fed her husband to the tigers....\n\nHere, Kitty Kitty is also a classic, splitter offwidth roof. To get to the crack itself, scramble into the cave to the left of the climb, and from a boulder, step across onto a small ledge, and grab the edge of the crack.... Figuring out how to get into the crack is part of the fun. The difficulties aren't over once you turn the roof, as you still have a steep, flaring, and overhanging crack to negotiate. After that, it's a glorious offwidth grovel to the top.\n\nThe first gear placement in the roof is blind, and you are about 20 feet off the ground at that point, so have your spotter double check your first piece from the ground before you invert into the crack. Alternatively, if you are too short or a scaredy-cat, you can lower off the anchors at the top and place your first piece (short people may have to jump to get the lip grab). This doesn't make the route any less difficult.\n\nI didn't think about the grade too much on this one, it certainly isn't the hardest offwidth roof out there (using Crumbling Reality as a benchmark for the upper end of S. Platte offwidths, this one feels easier), but this one you are pretty much climbing above a series of waterfalls, so that's pretty unique and cool.\n\nThis gets afternoon shade in the summer.","protection":"BD #3-#7.... You can place a hand-size piece behind the flake inside the roof. It seemed 50% solid to me but I will try to remove it next time I'm up there.
