It's not my route.\n\nThis is the line with the new bolts that starts right off the block between\n\nCharlie Don't Surf\n\nand Erotic Plants. There are 3 bolts on this block/close to the ground which may be the crux; the grade eases up after you step onto the actual face.  Continue straight up 70' to the anchors on '\n\nMiss M\n\n. (You'll note the old anchors of '\n\nMiss M\n\npoorly hammered to shreds 6 feet away. Good example of how NOT to do it.) Anyhow, the 2nd pitch IS the 2nd pitch of '\n\nMiss M\n\n, about 80' straight up to anchors at the ledge. You probably want to save rope and traverse over to the base of the 3rd pitch which starts about 10' right of '\n\nMiss M\n\n. Follow 12 or 13 bolts right and up about 160' to the visible anchors on the headwall. The 4th pitch follows new bolts up right and over the headwall about 70' to the top. We rap'd the route, but you can walk off from the summit to the right. This could probably be done in 3 pitches by combining the first two with a long rope.  Excellent rock, and if you think it's over bolted anywhere, don't clip.","protection":"14 QDs ought to do it. Good 3/8\" bolts with double bolt anchors.

The first pitch is dangerous with no protection past the crack.  The crux move is right below the first belay ledge of\n\nFour Eyes\n\n.  Falling from the crux is simply not an option.  I led this on sight ground up without previewing.  I never felt secure enough to stand and drill, so I just kept moving until I got to a point of no return.  I didn't mean to essentially solo the route, but it was pretty much that.  At the time I completed the route, I thought it was riskier than\n\nKrystal Klyr\n\n.  I've often wondered if anyone repeated the route.  The second pitch traverses left and then up past a poor bolt and to a belay on a tiny ledge with a solution hole that takes a small tricam and another crappy bolt.  This pitch is perhaps 5.9.  The last pitch is unprotected 5.6.","protection":"I placed three poor bolts on three pitches of climbing.  I placed no bolts on the first pitch.  A fall once you are 20 feet past the crack and all the way to the belay would surely mean a groundfall.  Pitch two has one bolt, and I don't recall if any gear is possible.  The second belay needs good bolts.  The last pitch has no protection but is easy.","location":"It is left of\n\nFour Eyes\n\n.
