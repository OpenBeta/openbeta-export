There are spots along the way were protection is available, best be had, and probably solid enough to hold a normal fall, though testing that seemed ill-advised. The crux pro for us was a #5 C4 Camalot. The upper dihedral section could take a second green Camalot if you are to take extras of anything.","location":"Facing Helen's Dome on the tower, there is an apparent corner system that runs nearly to the summit.
