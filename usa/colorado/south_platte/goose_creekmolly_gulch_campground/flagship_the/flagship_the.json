It will be obvious when you see it.  It is a striking corner hand and fist crack with a large chockstone about 60 feet up.  The crack is very easy to see from the top of Renaissance Slab.\n\np1 (5.10c/d, 80 feet?) Start up the corner with fingery liebacks.  Pull into the main crack section and climb locker hand jams with a few fists and a couple wider sections.  Pull over the huge chockstone (crux).  I set up a belay here (stopper and .75 camalot) as we only had a tiny rack, but you could probably continue.  We felt this pitch was probably 5.9 and very good quality.\n\np2 (9, 100 feet) Step right onto a slab and pull into a nice seam/finger crack.  Straight up this to a ledge, traverse slightly right over scary blocks to a thin, arching left facing flake. up this flake, undercling left, and then pull straight up over it.  Belay.  This pitch was kind of cool, double ropes were pretty helpful.\n\nThe guidebook shows a rap station, but we couldn't find it.  We hiked/scrambled up to the north, and then headed east and south down a huge gully.  Bring hedgeclippers.","protection":"Standard platte rack - stoppers and a set or two of cams to fist size.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,39d76483-f0b6-5190-923f-59e7bb956c35,8eb1989f-4204-5787-80f1-6e66d5e48e0a","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Goose Creek/Molly Gulch Campground","Flagship, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.33495,39.18868]},"bbox":[-105.33553015477597,39.188230339818126,-105.33436984522406,39.18912966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105746865","area_id":"jrGYn0IEV4eA8W5m1eSOCg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:14.493Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:55.935Z"}
