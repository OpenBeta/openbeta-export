Follow crack system to the top of the pillar. The first bolt is a little high, but solid easy crack climbing leads to it.\n\nPitch 2, 5.11a-, 5 bolts & anchor. This is the crux pitch and offers a little bit of everything. Start by stepping off the pillar on to the main face of the cliff, and work up to the base of the overhang. There are 2 parallel cracks to help with pulling the roof. Don't underestimate the face climb above the roof. You can skip the first set of anchors and do pitch 3 using standard 60m rope to save a belay stop.\n\nPitch 3, 4th class, one bolt & anchor. It angles slightly up and right.\n\nPitch 4, 5.10b, 7 bolts & anchor. This has fantastic granite slab climbing requiring some delicate feet.\n\nPitch 5, 5.10d, 7 bolts & the top has no anchor. It starts slabby but gets vertical with just enough of a crack to make it go.\n\nYou will need to walk off the top to the northeast & uphill.

The first bolt is about 12 feet up. Looking up from the start, you can see the overhang crux of pitch 2 with two cracks in it.\n\nHike in from the cairned on side of the road.
