Then again, the experience was subjective and perhaps I should mention that the roof crack can hold ice in the winter.... Absent jamming, the route felt more like hard 5.11, and was more difficult to protect.\n\nStart on P1 of\n\nHummingbird's Way\n\nand climb that to the large, left-leaning overhang above, placing long slings before continuing up and left on to Wild Turkey proper.  Pass the leaning overhang and stop below the large roof, placing some more gear and more long slings.

Launch up into that crack on hand to fist sized gear and... and....\n\nWell, at this point I'll describe what I saw, and then my experience.  I saw a hand and fist-sized crack out to the lip. I saw icicles hanging in my face... I felt up into the freezing wet crack trying to find purchase on a frozen flow...  Finally, pumping out, I under-clinged the roof, pasted a foot out to the right onto a bare overhang and pulled up into a knee-bar scum and then into a layback - some distance above my last piece of gear below the ice-flow.  From there, I proceeded... to make some of the most improbable and fantastic moves I've pulled in a long time, and shall remember for some time to come. YMMV - depending on ice and style.\n\nFrom a good rest just above the roof, the ice was passed.  There is a short distance of moderate, but potentially exhausted climbing to a ledge, but it could be runout in the absence of more fist-sized gear.
