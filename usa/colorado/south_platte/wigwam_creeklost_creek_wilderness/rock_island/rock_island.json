Locate a crack going up to a slab with a bolt. This should be to the left of a left-facing dihedral.\n\nPitch 1. Climb the crack to a slab with a bolt. Work left to another crack and up through more discontinuous cracks to a ledge. Either belay low on the ledge or climb up to the top of the next block and belay.\n\nPitch 2. Climb the wide-ish corner to a very strenuous crossover to a crack system on the right. This is the crux. Continue up the crack and belay.\n\nPitch 3. Continue up the run-out slab or step right and climb an easier crack.\n\nDescend off the backside working down hill to climbers right. Easy terrain leads back to the base of the climb. This route is a little off the beaten path but is definitely worth climbing. Expect the rock to be a little dirty due to the East and Northeast exposure.","protection":"The Hubbel guidebook to the South Platte, 1997 says pro to 3 inches, but you won't feel foolish bring a little bit bigger gear.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,66c7617d-c0b7-5f7b-9cf4-b7a71d2dde98,8c6d0db9-c4af-55a7-ad50-4ba3e0c87a31","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Wigwam Creek/Lost Creek Wilderness","Rock Island"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.45664,39.29247]},"bbox":[-105.45722101377508,39.29202033981814,-105.4560589862249,39.29291966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745816","area_id":"jG0NucSvVaetUEuj4Mh6MQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:11.730Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:50.993Z"}
