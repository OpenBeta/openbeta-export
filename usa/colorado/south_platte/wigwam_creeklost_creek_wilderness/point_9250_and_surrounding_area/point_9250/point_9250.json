This line follows that crack and continues past the small aspen (with slings) halfway up the dome. A third tree, a small pine, is farther up. If you find the pine tree at the base, you can't miss this climb.\n\nIt is mostly hand and finger-sized on very coarse rock with plenty of supplemental feet on the outside. The few feet of climbing before the first pine tree are superb. Sadly, the quality steadily deteriorates as you climb higher. If the initial quality continued to the top, this would be the best splitter in Colorado.\n\nDirectly above this climb, above and to the left of a third tree (a small pine), is a single newish Metolius hanger and bolt. It appears to be in good condition. It can be backed up with red or yellow Camalots. This is not my bolt, and I do not know the age of it.\n\nThis is approximately a 60m pitch. It can be toproped (via topdown belay) by scrambling to the top of the dome then down a moderate slab to the single bolt.\n\nDescent: 2 raps with a 60m via the small aspen.","protection":"Mostly hand and finger size and doubles in Camalots to red with many finger-sized stoppers.","location":"This is on the northeast face, facing the trail."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,66c7617d-c0b7-5f7b-9cf4-b7a71d2dde98,990fe0ea-c329-5704-a389-ddb9cd5d2f41,25a2973a-71eb-59d6-b6c8-2ecf2236c19f","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Wigwam Creek/Lost Creek Wilderness","Point 9250 and Surrounding Area","Point 9250"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.40009,39.22029]},"bbox":[-105.40067041591962,39.21984033981813,-105.39950958408036,39.22073966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116519223","area_id":"JaKXOnHrWda2yC7PIjbBnw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.40067041591962,39.21984033981813],[-105.39950958408036,39.21984033981813],[-105.39950958408036,39.22073966018186],[-105.40067041591962,39.22073966018186],[-105.40067041591962,39.21984033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:11.734Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:13.570Z"}
