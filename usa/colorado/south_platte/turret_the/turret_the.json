The route is on the northeast corner of the rock, a low angle chimney.  Pitch 1 (5.8) is 160.  Climb mossy cracks (reasonable protection) for 60 and then enter the main chimney.  A cam (#3 Camalot) in questionable rock protects 15 feet of crux chimneying, up to a chockstone and good protection.  Pass a second, larger chockstone on the left and scramble 30 feet up a very low angle chimney to a belay.  Unrope and walk back (south) through a corridor, turn left and tunnel 30 to the eastern edge of the rock.  Turn right and scramble (Class 4) up to a plateau where you can see the north and south summit blocks, and belay (long sling around a big knob).  For the final pitch (5.6 X, 60 long), climb down to the notch, step across and mantle onto a large, loose flake.  Carefully climb up over more loose flakes to the summit area.","protection":"#1-#4 cams are best.  The rock is of very poor quality - nuts and hexes will likely blow out in several placements.  Carefully consider placements in the choss.  We brought doubles from #1-#4 cams and several runners.  The summit itself has an ANCIENT fixed pin (which unfortnately I failed to get a picture of).  Not sure what it was used for.  We installed 2 new bolts, slings, and a rap ring on the east face at a bearing of about 45 degrees north.  A very exposed 4th class descending traverse is required to reach the anchor.  Ropes were pulled easily from our new anchor.  I'd recommend lowering/belaying from the summit area (good cracks on the summit) to the anchor.  The rappel is 160' long.\n\nNOTE:  If that hanging flake slides off, which it will sooner or later, I don't know how you'd get up there.  As it is, the last 70' pitch is a 5.6 free solo on the rotten flakes, scallops, and a few crystals.","location":"This route starts off as a crack climb, then transitions to a reclining chimney about 75' up.
