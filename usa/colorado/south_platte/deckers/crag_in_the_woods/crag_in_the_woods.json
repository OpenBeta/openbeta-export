The crux is above the bolt, and it may be a surprise.  You start in a thin crack which protects best with small cams. Above the crux, you find a nice ledge to rest on. From the ledge, a crack goes up to the anchor tree. This is not the best crack as it contains some loose rock and suspect holds. It does protect all right. This is a challenging route if you make it to this rock.\n\nThere is a 5.8 variation start listed in the book done by using the crack right of the bolt. I did not do it.","protection":"Standard rack and 1 bolt. There is a tree anchor on top.","location":"This is the leftmost route at the crag.
