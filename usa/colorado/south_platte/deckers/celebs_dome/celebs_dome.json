It may not be the worst sport route ever, but it is fairly close. I have not been on many that are worse. The rock is friable and chossy on the last quarter of the route. It is not too bad on the first three quarters. There are flakes up top that will probably fall off if used as holds. Most of the bolts are buttonhead style, and the ones that are not have SMC hangers. It is a long ways between the first and second bolts. A small cam can likely be placed toward the left side in this section. Something close to a #0.75 Camalot. At the third bolt, you traverse right past two bolts before moving up again. The crux seems to be at about the 6th bolt right before the really horrible rock. I toproped the route, and if you climb it, I suggest doing so.","protection":"10 bolts (mostly buttonhead). Make a gear anchor at the top. I used 2 #1 Camalots, a nut, and a #0.4 Camalot.","location":"This route is on the right side of the crag in the tallest section of the rock.  The two bolts on the traverse can be seen from the ground.  It is hard to see the first bolt from the base.  You walk off to the right (east)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"IRrVYRwuWc2NFyVmC/k+SA==","name":"Brain Doc","yds":"5.8+","grades":{"yds":"5.8+","french":"5b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.22677,39.25424]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"111114061","mp_crag_id":"111113837","climb_id":"IRrVYRwuWc2NFyVmC/k+SA==","areaRef":"JdnpsWP9UQKvdWzilhFYLw=="},"content":{"description":"This route is not very good. The dihedral looks like it would be fun, but there is chossy rock at the beginning, and the pro is not very inspiring at first. I placed C3s as my first protection, and these protect the crux. Right at the crux I placed an RP. As you exit the crux, you have to go by a bush that is in the way of the crack. The crack takes better gear near the top, but the bottom is not fun. This route is easy to toprope.","protection":"Standard rack, good to have small cams like c3s and also RPs. Build a gear anchor at the top. There is a small tree near the top and decent cracks.","location":"This route is about in the middle of the rock and is in a large, left-facing dihedral. There are bushes in the dihedral crack.
