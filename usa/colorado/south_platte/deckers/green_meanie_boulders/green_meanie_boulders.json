There is just enough room for a crash pad to be placed off the pavement. Moonridge Crack is rarely climbed, so slippery pine needles can build up on the upper slab, above the overhanging 5.10 Â crack, presenting a big fall hazard. By the way, spelling for Moonridge is based on local nomenclature.\n\nIt is located about 0.8 miles west of Rampart Range Road on CO Hwy 67.
