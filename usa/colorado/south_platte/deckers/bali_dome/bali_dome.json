From Denver, go West on US Hwy 285, go South (left) on Foxton Rd, this Ts at the South Platte River, head East (left) to South Platte, then it curves South, go 3 miles. There is a prominent large boulder across the South Platte River just North of the parking area. Park where legal. 2 drainages can be hiked up. The North one has Atlantis Slab a short way up. Choose the South drainage. Hike 20 minutes or so. Find this rock just past Java Dome. Scramble up and around some boulders to past the South face of Java Dome and find Bali Dome abutting the right side of Java Dome. This route is the 2nd route from the left on this slab. Start on a gravelly bench. The 1st route may be hard to see.\n\nThis is a very runout and scary route that may invite the unwary beginner. Beware. The belayer should be ready to pull in lots of rope in the event of a fall. Protection is mostly mental. 4 (or 5) bolts (mostly in the beginning of the route) grace this 200+ foot pitch. Despite the topo in P. Hubbel's South Platte guidebook, the anchors are much more than 160 feet up. There is a significant runout above the 3rd bolt and an even more significant runout above the 4th bolt. Yes, it is slabbing, but I don't recommend falling. There is a left variation above the 3rd bolt, but it is better to smear straight between the 3rd and 4th bolts. We simul-climbed about 30 feet to reach the 2 bolt anchor and not to belay off a single bolt. Natural protection is very limited.\n\nPer\n\nJames\n\n: there is a 5th bolt. If you go straight past the 5th bolt, you can reach trees at ~200'.\n\nRap 180 feet angling right, well right of the route to a bench.
