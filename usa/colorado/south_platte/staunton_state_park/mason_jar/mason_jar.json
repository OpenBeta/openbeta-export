From the left side of the dome, find a broken arete/dihedral. Climb for 70 meters if you have long rope or break it apart at big ledge midway up the first pitch, 35-70m pitch.\n\nP2. Even with a 70m rope, we were forced to break it into 2 pitches. The last pitch we did was steep face and crack /jugs until you hit a low angle ramp.\n\nP3. For us, this was not really a “pitch”, but we stayed roped up to the top for the last 15 meters.\n\n(The route we did for sure was not climbed. I can tell loose rock when I see it from virgin ground; however, be warned this is entirely gear route with no fixed anchors.)\n\n**This warrants a PG-13 rating for rock quality. **\n\nThis peak has been climbed before for sure. Someone has been up there, as there was summit cairn.\n\nThe descent for us was a walkoff /downclimb off the short back side.","protection":"Gear.","location":"Look for broken arete /dihedral deal on the left side of the dome."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,9c4813f1-30d1-5705-96de-19a23e027a4b,a5568ad2-82e4-55c9-9afd-1a4a2618799c","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Staunton State Park","Mason Jar"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.38411,39.51374]},"bbox":[-105.38469285999706,39.51329033981814,-105.38352714000298,39.51418966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121568183","area_id":"pVaK0oLkVcma/RpKJhh5nA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.38469285999706,39.51329033981814],[-105.38352714000298,39.51329033981814],[-105.38352714000298,39.51418966018187],[-105.38469285999706,39.51418966018187],[-105.38469285999706,39.51329033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:11.727Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:13.340Z"}
