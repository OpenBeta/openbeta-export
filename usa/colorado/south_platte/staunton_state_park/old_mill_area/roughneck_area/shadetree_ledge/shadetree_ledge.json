Although there are a few bomber gear placements down low, this line was bolted to be entirely sport and to be reasonably protected for the grade (hence the name). It has lots of bolts -- approximately 15 or 16 to eliminate potential ledgefalls.\n\nA funky start leads to a short, moderate section which then gains a steep crack/seam. Crank through here (crux?), then make the diagonal traverse up and left to the headwall. Climb the headwall on great chickenheads to an anchor just shy of the top (unfortunately the rock at the top was no good for bolts). The climb is longer than it is tall due to its diagonal nature.\n\nNote: a 70 meter rope will get you down, just watch your ends. Or belay up top then rap to the intermediate anchor down and right on Chicken Little.","protection":"Bolts.","location":"It is the leftmost bolted line on the Shadetree Ledge."},"__v":0},{"_id":"YSRBjWb2VaKxJF/3cu1Pqw==","name":"Services Rendered","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"NB","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.39124,39.52278]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"121610150","mp_crag_id":"120395382","climb_id":"YSRBjWb2VaKxJF/3cu1Pqw==","areaRef":"fayRugpFU1qsYivaE9VrGA=="},"content":{"description":"P1. Climb the easy hand crack up the short slab (protected by #2 and #3 Camalot) to the overlaps. This is the only section requiring gear, then it is all bolts from here. Clip the first high bolt with a long(ish) sling, and undercling out right to the next bolt (clip it semi-long also). Continue out the flake a little more, and turn the lip to gain a left-angling corner. Move up, and clip the 3rd bolt long (also longish).

Traverse left along the ledge/ramp feature below the steep orange wall past the first couple of bolts. Around bolt 3, the climbing gets steeper, continues diagonaling up and left, and culminates with a juggy roof pull to gain a ledge (there is a hollow block here, but it is attached and better than it looks).
