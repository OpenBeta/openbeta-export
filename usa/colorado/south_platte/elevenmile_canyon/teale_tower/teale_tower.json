This \"Yosemite like\" (not really) climb would be a one star in Yosemite.\n\nThe obvious corner in middle of the south face of Teale Tower, a few feet to the right of a rounded fist/offwidth crack.\n\nStarts with thin stemming and laybacking (crux) that widens to hands.  Pass an offwidth section (#4 Camalot) with classy stemming and laybacking.  Belay at a big ledge.  Pitch 2 continues up the corner (5.9 crux about 15' up) to the intimidating roof; easier than it looks.\n\nAnti-beta caveats: D'Antonio's guide shows two bolts at the the first belay.  There are no bolts here, just a sling wedged in a constriction.  Stuart Green's Colorado guide recommends a rack of double 1-4 Friends; this is just plain wrong.","protection":"Small to medium nuts.  Cams from blue Alien to #4 Camalot.
