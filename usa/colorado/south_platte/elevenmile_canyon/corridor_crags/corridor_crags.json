It is a right-leaning splitter that is slightly overhanging. Because of its location, it probably is not climbed often, providing gritty hand and finger holds.","protection":"Cams to three inches.","location":"From Corridor Crags, continue along the well marked trail that leads to the top of Baboon Rock. After a few hundred feet, follow a fork to the left. Another hundred feet or so you will see slabs to the right and a large cairn. Up and on the slabs you will see to the northwest a large block with the splitter. The easiest way to reach the block at this point is to head west and then north where a gully will get you to the start."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,3ba6deba-9e8e-5541-9ce5-51901a67fa83,0137546b-6c33-5ee8-9241-25453b9ea264","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Elevenmile Canyon","Corridor Crags"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.46689,38.90742]},"bbox":[-105.46746784919677,38.906970339818145,-105.46631215080323,38.90786966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111912703","area_id":"ATdUa2wzXuiSQSVFO56iZA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:13.545Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:54.458Z"}
