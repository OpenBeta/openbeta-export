The first bolt is about 25 feet off the ground.  Climb to the bolt using gear for pro if you desire.  Up through interesting and varied terrain past several bolts. I remember wanting a small Alien for one of the lower cruxes.  I do not know what the intent of the first ascent was but where the bolts ended I climbed on trad gear through an excellent right facing roof flake thingy.  This could be as hard as 10a but protects really well with a #1 Friend.  Continue on up past this and belay at a nice tree with a great veiw of the beautiful canyon.  Walk off easiler to the climbers right.  I really liked this route as it has a very old school feel to it and the rock is friendly, rough, beautiful granite.\n\n[Eds.
