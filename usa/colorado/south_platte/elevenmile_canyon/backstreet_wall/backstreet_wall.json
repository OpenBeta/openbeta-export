I saw the crack and started up it, because it looked like an easy layback, knowing it was not in my guidebook -- but I also thought I saw black anchor chains at the top of the left crack.  When I got up there, it was not anchor chains -- it was bird poop!  So, I had to traverse up and about 25 feet left to get to the anchors for\n\nAnything but the Fast Lane\n\n.
