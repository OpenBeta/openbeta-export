This is the farthest right line on digital tower. Move your belay over here.\n\nThe first crux is maybe 12b, involving a series of slightly overhanging moves, culminating in a big reach out of a slopey granite hueco.  The second crux is a 10 foot section of 12c micro edging and pebble tweaking.\n\nThe only drawback to the line is a section of 8-10 feet of chossy stone near the start - just grit your teeth and put up with this, as the climbing above is outstanding.","protection":"9 bolts?","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"smA9c+dCWOOIXPeGXJ/qCw==","name":"The Middle Route","yds":"5.12b","grades":{"yds":"5.12b","french":"7b"},"fa":"Anderson,1999?","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.10251,39.25912]},"left_right_index":6,"mp_id":"105756316","mp_crag_id":"105745504","climb_id":"smA9c+dCWOOIXPeGXJ/qCw==","areaRef":"1OaUgVuKV9eshs4WF4itIw=="},"content":{"description":"First of all, this route probably deserves more than one star.

You will know you are doing the crux correctly if the holds don't break.  Any other attempted sequence seems to result in broken holds.\n\nI have seen a couple of climbers start this line and become frustrated with the rock and then quit and do a different line.\n\nIf you can get through this 8 foot band of choss, the climbing then turns into excellent 11+ moves up an overhanging wall on solid stone - very fun.  It is definitely worth doing (after you have done all the other routes on Digital Tower first).\n\nFrom the belay ledge (accessed by doing the first pitch of Beta Sponge - see that route description), the next route to right of the belay is Jesus H.
