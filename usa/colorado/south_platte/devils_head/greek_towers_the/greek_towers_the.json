It's too bad the rock quality for the stem isn't a little better. The first pitch in my opinion is 3 stars.\n\nFrom the southwest side of Sisyphus Tower, locate the obvious offwidth up a dihedral. A quick bushwhack mantel leads to the crux dihedral. Good footwork makes the climbing tolerable. Belay at the top of the dihedral.
