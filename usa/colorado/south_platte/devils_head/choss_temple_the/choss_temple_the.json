This route goes up a moderate and slightly chossy lower panel until it reaches a burly roof.  The rock is very solid in the roof and everywhere above the roof.  The roof moves are steep and bouldery at the V4/5 level, but the hard part only lasts about 8 feet.  Then it is a long and pleasant cruise to the anchors on nice rock.Very worthwhile for the cool boulder problem.\n\nThis is the leftmost route on the Choss Temple.
