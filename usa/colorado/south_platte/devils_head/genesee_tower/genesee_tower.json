The opening aid moves are protected by a selection of lost arrows in a chossy seam. High step/pull past the LAs, and grovel into the runnel. Then climb to a small ledge, and from the ledge, face climb to the tippy-top (no pro).\n\nThis climb will probably go free around 5.8/5.9 R/X. If you try to free the tower, blowing the opening moves will result in an additional 40 foot groundfall off the narrow belay ledge. Due to the dubious, dirty rock, I wouldn't want to whip on the Lost Arrows. Maybe your cajones are bigger than mine.\n\nRappel west from a bolted anchor.","protection":"A selection of Lost Arrows and Black Diamond C4 #3-6.","location":"This ascends the West side of the tower."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,100d5508-4531-5c61-b19e-fa666bc6229a,c4060eba-5cee-56fe-9152-a5a5752debd7","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Devil's Head","Genesee Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.10557,39.26915]},"bbox":[-105.1061508203838,39.26870033981813,-105.10498917961623,39.26959966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115137643","area_id":"xAYOulzuVv6RUqWldS3r1w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.1061508203838,39.26870033981813],[-105.10498917961623,39.26870033981813],[-105.10498917961623,39.26959966018187],[-105.1061508203838,39.26959966018187],[-105.1061508203838,39.26870033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:16.501Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:21.563Z"}
