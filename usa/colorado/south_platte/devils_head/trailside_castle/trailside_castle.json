This route was much easier than expected.\n\nPitch 1.\n\nTunnel under a boulder and chimney up to a crack system behind the boulder. Climb the heavily bushed crack, and traverse left to a prominent ledge with a large tree. This crack/chimney faces the trail,\n\n5.5, 55 feet.\n\nPitch 2.\n\nMake a bouldery move from the ledge to reach the obvious offwidth crack. Climb the offwidth to the top. The crack is low angle with enough features that no real offwidth technique is required,\n\n5.6, 40 feet.\n\nWe downclimbed the route, so there isn't a rappel anchor. There is a small tree on the north end of the summit that might work as a rappel anchor, but it might be more than 100 feet? Also, we did find an old rusted piton near the summit located in a different crack system.","protection":"A small select rack. One BD C4 #4 and two #6s are recommended for the upper pitch.
