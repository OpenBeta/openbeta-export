Fire upward over the bulge onto a spooky flake, and work your way up the face above on thin, spooky holds.  The last bit is kind of slabby, or you could probably climb the corner a bit to the right.\n\nThe climbing on this route is really good, but many of the holds through the upper half feel very fragile, and there is one decent-sized, hollow flake that you have to tug on a bit.  Your belayer will want to pay attention. I pulled off a handful of chunks, and I am generally pretty careful.","protection":"All bolts, probably 8 or so, plus anchors.  I recommend unclipping the first 2 bolts after you have clipped the third bolt.  There is a fair amount of loose rock above, and the geometry of The Shaft is such that any loose rock that comes down will be deflected towards the belayer.  Unclipping the first 2 bolts will give the belayer more freedom to move out of the way.
