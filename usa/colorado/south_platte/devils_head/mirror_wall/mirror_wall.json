The small roof system on the Mirror Wall is obvious, and the line busting through on the right hand side is Ziggy's sell out. Good flakes on classic Head stone crop up in passing the shallow roof system, and route crux, on arch-typical Devil's Head climbing. This is in fact unusual for this wall which has seemed to me to be usually of a lower quality than other walls on the Head. A bit more friable and a bit more crystalline. Clipping these bolts can't really be a sell-out even for an old tradster like Ernie (aka: The Zig, aka: Ziggy). This is a very fine addition to this sector and presently the best route on the wall.","protection":"Ten draws and a rope.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,100d5508-4531-5c61-b19e-fa666bc6229a,76e5ce75-4c84-55ba-80a6-539397e9bf73","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Devil's Head","Mirror Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.11b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.09907,39.25631]},"bbox":[-105.0996507139985,39.25586033981813,-105.09848928600151,39.25675966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105745585","area_id":"duXOdUyEVbqAplOTl+m/cw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.0996507139985,39.25586033981813],[-105.09848928600151,39.25586033981813],[-105.09848928600151,39.25675966018186],[-105.0996507139985,39.25675966018186],[-105.0996507139985,39.25586033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:16.498Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:20.906Z"}
