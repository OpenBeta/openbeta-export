I was able to get a small, yellow Metolius to protect the mantel and then back cleaned it to reduce drag. Keep angling left, moving up a hand crack then a short offwidth to get under the fun part. I would have been happy with three #6 cams but got by with one by leap frogging it several times. Climb in the giant slot, and worm your way up. The crux will be way easier the smaller you are. Once through the crux, slide out of the hole, and work your way up to the anchors.","protection":"Big Bros or three #6 cams will make you feel better than I did. There are bolted anchors at the top.","location":"This route is on the west face.
