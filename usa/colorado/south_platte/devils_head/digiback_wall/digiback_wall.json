The crux is the first 10 feet above the ledge, coming in the form of small but decent holds on a vertical wall. This is well-protected as long as your belayer keeps slack out of the rope. Above the crux wall, the angle relents again, and the line wanders a bit, following the path of least resistance. One bolt is well hidden behind a bush and cannot be seen until you move the bush out of the way.\n\nA 60 meter rope is just long enough to rap to the ground from the anchor. Watch the ends, and swing slightly to rapper's left near the bottom if need be. Due to the slightly wandering nature of the route, a 60 meter rope will NOT get you to the ground if you have your partner lower you after leading this route. Either use a 70 meter rope, belay from the top, or be prepared to have your partner start climbing 10 feet before you touch down.\n\nThis route is a good warm-up before jumping on the steep routes at the nearby Cam and Eggs Wall.","protection":"10 bolts to a bolted anchor.","location":"This route sits off by itself on the right side of the wall, just a bit right of the main cluster of routes. Look for a low angle slab that leads to slightly steeper terrain."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,100d5508-4531-5c61-b19e-fa666bc6229a,9a761d69-66b1-5868-92ab-67f8a63c4864","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Devil's Head","Digiback Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.103,39.25933]},"bbox":[-105.10358073901443,39.258880339818134,-105.10241926098554,39.259779660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114545677","area_id":"mnYdaWaxWGiSq2f4pjxIZA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.10358073901443,39.258880339818134],[-105.10241926098554,39.258880339818134],[-105.10241926098554,39.259779660181856],[-105.10358073901443,39.259779660181856],[-105.10358073901443,39.258880339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:16.502Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:50.578Z"}
