The FA team raved about incut flakes and high quality climbing; however, the convenience of doing other things on the crimpfest was enough to keep Hidden Treasure on the back burner. Well, I'll second the rave reviews, however belatedly. This has beautiful climbing on great features in a quite little nook. Perhaps we can call it adventure sport climbing. I'd go three stars for the stone, the flakes, the pro, and the spot. Bring the wine and a lady friend; never know what might develop.","protection":"Take a dozen draws and double ropes.
