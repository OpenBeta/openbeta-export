If the good climbing were more continuous this would be a 3 star.  One important note:  the bolted anchors are not visible from the ground or anywhere on the route until you reach them.  The key is to trend left above the little tree on the slab and go around a bulge to a ledge with the anchors.  This is slightly run out, hence the PG-13 rating.","protection":"Standard rack and slings.

Engage a 5.9 crux move over a bulge, move up, and breath deep as you negotiate an exciting run-out up a superb slab (5.9-).

The first crux comes shortly off the ground.  Midway up the route, there are two options for continuing to the anchors:  1) Angle left towards the crack system, with 3 bolts, this is listed as Malt (10.a) in Anderson's guide.  I didn't take this line, as it looked too runout for my tastes without any supplemental gear, which I wasn't carrying; or 2) Veer right to join the second half of\n\nA Woman Scorned\n\n(10c upper section).  We followed this line - the crux of this upper section involves delicate footwork and balancey moves.  Overall a nice route on good granite.  The bolting was well done - spaced further out on the easier sections, well protected on the crux sections.","protection":"12-14 draws, plus gear for the 2 bolt anchor that is shared with the adjacent\n\nA Woman Scorned\n\nroute.
