Continuous climbing past the first 10 bolts gives way to some easier climbing, then hard again as the rock steepens higher up.  There are two anchors on this route so that you can just do the first 100' or go all the way in one pitch (bring a fat wad of draws).

The route is about 55 feet - it looks miniscule since it only goes a third of the way up the tower. A second pitch may be added in the future. Above the anchors, the wall goes quite blank - the potential second pitch here will be sick thin. The route starts off slightly overhanging on good rock with big holds.The first clip is a little spooky but reasonable - bring a stick clip if you want to avoid being scared.\n\n3 or 4 bolts of nice 10a climbing lead to a reachy 10+ section that diagonals up and left, culiminating with some of the most incredible chickenhead grips I've ever pulled on.\n\nFrom here, begin an 11a sequence (maybe a shade harder than most 11a moves) on small holds involving some high stepping and good footwork.\n\nIt is really fun - if it were only longer, I would have said 3 stars.","protection":"7 bolts to a coldshut anchor.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,100d5508-4531-5c61-b19e-fa666bc6229a,21c738d0-6315-5bf1-b410-bb160abaeaf1,a9343184-7f55-5f84-a9b1-f4ffb2608436,adf9e52a-7f92-5b7f-b00c-bde2faf835fe","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Devil's Head","Arena, The","De-Spectactulus Tower","East Side"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.10263,39.25668]},"bbox":[-105.10321071706315,39.256230339818146,-105.10204928293685,39.25712966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109052323","area_id":"rfnlKn+SW3+wDL3i+vg1/g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.10321071706315,39.256230339818146],[-105.10204928293685,39.256230339818146],[-105.10204928293685,39.25712966018187],[-105.10321071706315,39.25712966018187],[-105.10321071706315,39.256230339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:17.251Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:51.582Z"}
