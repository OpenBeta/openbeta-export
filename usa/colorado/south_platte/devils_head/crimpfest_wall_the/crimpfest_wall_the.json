Climb through thin moves past the first three bolts (first crux) which is harder if you're short. Easier 5.11 climbing then leads to a no hands rest. Continuing upward, finesse and sequence underclings with delicate feet or power off a sharp hold to easier climbing (crux of the route). Hang on tight to a “Thank God” patina, and then romp up 15 feet of easier climbing to the anchor.","protection":"~12 draws +an  anchor.","location":"It is the furthest left route at Crimpfest."},"__v":0},{"_id":"IDBwqmDUXgare5mdyD8TRg==","name":"Better Rad than Trad","yds":"5.12b","grades":{"yds":"5.12b","french":"7b"},"fa":"Tod Anderson","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.09877,39.25618]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"105754393","mp_crag_id":"105744882","climb_id":"IDBwqmDUXgare5mdyD8TRg==","areaRef":"bF+f7wvBW2yPUumfQJFq0Q=="},"content":{"description":"Long (100 foot) line that goes over two roofs on thin holds.
