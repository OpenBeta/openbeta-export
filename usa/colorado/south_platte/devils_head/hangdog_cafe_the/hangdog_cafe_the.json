The route is short and can easily be broken down into a couple boulder problems.  The rock is really good, the protection is excellent, and for the short length the variety and quality of the climbing is very good.  There are 2 good warmups (10b and 11b) to the right and you can easily hang the draws for this one.\n\nBegin just left of '\n\nCrimp Scampi\n\n' near the right side of the wall.  Tediously make your way up to the first bolt (stick clipping is a good idea, there is a fragile flake).  Set up for the first crux and fight to a good rest.  Decipher the upper crux, fighting the urge to step out right to easier climbing.\n\nBoth books give Dyne and Dash a single devil/star.  I thought it was better - the only knocks on it being the short length and the temptation of moving out to the right onto '\n\nCrimp Scampi\n\n' at the upper crux.  The topo shows the lower crux as being 11b, which seemed way off.  Do not underestimate this part (as I did my first time on the route) - this part actually gave me more trouble than the upper crux.  The lower crux will probably punish the short, while the upper crux mangles the tall.  It is an equal opportunity sort of route.","protection":"5 bolts (IIRC) and anchors.","location":"This is at the Hangdog Cafe, it is the 3rd route from the furthest right.

However, this route has nice continuity and plenty of 5.10 maneuvering before and after the crux.\n\nI usually avoid giving much beta, but I will make an exception here - when the going gets tough, think right hand layaway and get your feet high.  Then start a long reach to a blind hold - when you think you can't go any higher, go a little further.
