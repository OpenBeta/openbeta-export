I used it as a warm-up, and climbing it really has no other purpose. There is a #4 Camalot-sized crack about halfway up. Above this crack you move to the right to go up the obvious crack. The crux is steep, but there are good undercling holds here.  Hubbel gave the climb a 5.7 rating in his guides, but in the Haas guide, it gets a 5.6 rating, and I agree with it. The crack is a bit vegetated near the top, and the rock is a little crumbly.","protection":"Standard rack up to a #4 Camalot.

The crack goes up until a slab near the top.  The bolts are old and probably 1/4 inch sized. They don't inspire a ton of confidence but are better than nothing. You start by climbing up to a bolt and then enter the offwidth. These moves are likely the crux. The crack gets a little smaller above before you reach a pin and bolt protected slab climbing. None of the bolts look good, but one seems very bad.","protection":"Rack to a #6 Camalot, 3 bolts, and two fixed pins (I only saw one pin).
