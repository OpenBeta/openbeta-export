This starts as a deep and wide flare that pinches down from wide (stemming) to fingers over its length.\n\nThe cruxes come when stepping out into the jams, as your feet disappear (physical crux) and then higher as the jams become flaring thin hands with crumbling feet (delicate crux).\n\nMy [partner] and I cleaned the route up a little, and it will probably further improve with traffic. However, at present it is not a great climb.","protection":"A single set of cams to as big as you have. The bigger the pro you take, the sooner you get gear, though it may require a runner.
