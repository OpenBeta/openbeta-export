The difficulties can be minimized by aiding through crux on good bolts making this route 5.10-A0.\n\nP1- Start up left side of flake below obvious roof. After about 10 feet, head right, place a good cam in crack and face climb right, and up to good bolt, a few more face moves takes you to wide crack that gets smaller as you ascend 5.9+/5.10a (180 feet to fixed anchor).\n\nP2- This short pitch climbs double crack system to next good ledge 5.7 (50 feet).\n\nP3.

The BT is located between Poe Buttress and Cynical Pinnacle.  Approach from either CP or the Sunshine Wall trail.  Look for a prominent left-leaning slot at the top of this wall.  The climb starts directly below and heads for this slot.  Start by gaining a ledge that has a left-facing low angle dihedral which leads to a crack system.  There are a few ways to start this climb.\n\nP0 - Dean Miller sandbag start (9?).  This starts off a ledge slightly to the right of P1.  Mantle onto a large flat area, walk back to the short right facing fatty (big cam).  Ascend the fatty to gain a ledge and head up and left on a second and more pleasant right facing dihedral to belay.  If you're smart, you'll scramble up to this ledge from the left to avoid this pitch.  This short pitch is recommended  if you want to get a close view of contorted facial expressions on climbers that are too distant to appreciate higher on the climb.\n\nP1 - Ascend the low angle left-facing dihedral to a small ledge and continue on a really nice 5.9 finger crack. Hand jams appear higher. Continue to a 2 bolt belay or better yet, run P1 and P2 together as we did.\n\nP2 - This pitch starts as mostly hands and soon leads to a nice wide section (9).  Arm bar, stack, heel-toe and grunt your way up this beautiful specimen to a boulder wedged into the crack after the pitch gets easy.  Stand on this chock boulder and set your belay using the 2 cracks on the left.  There is a bolt on the face to the right that I didn't bother clipping. Topos in the book show 2 bolts - there's only the one.\n\nP3 - Climb the finger crack on the left side of the chimney directly above the belay.  Clip the poor excuse for a bolt to the left of where the crack ends.  Move left (10-) to easy terrain and continue a very short distance to a small stance at the base of a crack.  Send the tall skinny guy on this short pitch.\n\nP4 - This pitch (called both 5.9 and 10-, who cares?) starts as a nice and easy hand crack and then turns mean and wide.  Don't dump your fat pro in the first wide section as it is very easy.  After this section, the crack leads into the left leaning slot that is visible from the ground.  First chimney, then move into a hand crack inside the slot for a while, grunt your way out and up and you are squeezed by the narrowing slot, place a fatty or 2 (unless you were me), return to squeezing and arm barring, and finally get some better loving as you move over and around the end of the slot.  Head to a sloping ledge at the base of an obvious crack and have a seat.  By now, you'll have scraped all the hair from your palms.\n\nP5 - It almost doesn't count as a pitch, but it is prudent to stop at the base of this pitch.  It is probably  1-1/2 moves of 7 or 8.  Hop up into the crack, place a wide piece grunt and its over.  Continue maybe 20 more feet and set a belay somewhere.  It's done.\n\nThis moderate climb has many enjoyable wide sections on it.  It is possible to face climb and do some stemming to avoid squeezing into these plump portions.  If you are leading these pitches, then you may want to stay in the crack.  If you are seconding, then remember that life is cheap on toprope.  High top climbing shoes are recommended for this climb.","protection":"Many sections of this route lend themselves to #6 Friend placements.  Leave RPs and 0 TCUs in your pack.
