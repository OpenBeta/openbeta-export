This may be THE best crack climb in the South Platte region. If you have not done this route, get after it ASAP. The climb takes on the awesome, striking crack and corner system which splits the south face of Cynical Pinnacle.\n\nHump up the hill, and find the steep corridor which leads to the start of this and the\n\nCenter Route\n\n. The route described here is \"The Complete Wunsch's Dihedral\", which avoids the original first pitch.\n\nPitch 1\n\n: the Breashear's Finger Crack, 5.11d. Climb the tight, straight-in finger crack that splits the end of the alcove. It is hard right off the start, with a tricky move through a pod and bulge. The crack remains strenuous most of the way to the end of the pitch. Protect with many wireds and TCUs to 1 or 2 inch cams. Belay on an excellent ledge (fixed anchors). This is a long pitch and is outstanding.\n\nPitch 2:\n\n5.10d. Climb the sustained, brilliant hand crack directly off the ledge to a semi-sling belay in an alcove below a roof (fixed anchors). Bring extra hand-size cams. It is incredible.\n\nPitch 3:\n\n5.11. Awkwardly surmount the roof (possible 4\" cam), then stem and lieback your way up the incredible corner. Use wired nuts and TCUs for protection. The corner opens up to a wide 5.8 hand-fist crack higher, so have a piece or 2 in this size also. Belay on a large sloping ledge below a bolt ladder. This is brilliant.\n\nPitch 4:\n\n5.12b. Ascend the bolt ladder directly. This is very thin, steep nubbin climbing. It is easily (and often) aided. It is also possible to diverge left at the 3rd or 4th bolt and climb the unprotected face at 5.11 (the original free variation). It is stupendous.\n\nDescent:\n\nYou can descend from the summit of the Pinnacle with one 60 meter rope, but a 70m is a bit more comfy. First, use the rap station to the NE, bringing you to the shoulder at the top of the\n\nCenter Route\n\n. From there, you can descend the front side face, to the climber's right of the center route on new bolt anchors. The rappels wander slightly but reach the ground in 4 clean and simple rappels.\n\nThis formation is closed Feb. to end of July for bird nesting. It can get pretty hot up there in August, and this is doable even mid-winter on a good day.\n\nIf I were to list the 4 must-do, classic 5.10-5.11 multi-pitch routes in the state, they would be: Wunsch's Dihedral,\n\nThe Yellow Wall\n\non the Diamond,\n\nThe Naked Edge\n\n, and\n\nThe Scenic Cruise\n\n.","protection":"2 or 3 sets wireds to 3\" cam, two 3.5\" and one 4\" cam.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"IUmGeKWyWiq1y5Wsg8mDQA==","name":"Twist O' Flex","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.25164,39.42059]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"108410270","mp_crag_id":"105797908","climb_id":"IUmGeKWyWiq1y5Wsg8mDQA==","areaRef":"vkrINKdAXcyzcmtvux4xfw=="},"content":{"description":"This is about 100 feet left of\n\nHand Job Direct\n\n, on your way to the base of\n\nHand Job\n\n.

In classic South Platte ground up fashion, he and his partner started up\n\nWunsch's Dihedral\n\nthen found a sneaky traverse left to a perch on the arête of the southwest face of the Pinnacle. From this belay, they made it 4 bolts up the face but never returned to finish.\n\nThe route sat waiting for 15+ years until Cody and I decided to check it out in the fall of 2014. With the intent of taking the line to the top of the formation (200+ feet further than Strappo and partner got), we decided to meet the Platte ethics in the middle by rappelling in to determine if the line was worth bolting. The last thing we wanted to do was create a bolt ladder to nowhere on the Pinnacle. Though we never rehearsed the route, we were fairly confident that the line would go free.\n\nWe pulled the ropes and spent the next few weeks hanging on hooks, bolting our way up the route. Some people might argue that our style was not \"pure,\" but the result was a route that was well thought out and still has that Platte character that we have come to love.
