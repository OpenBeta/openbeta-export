Sit start on fist jams, and eventually invert into the offwidth, then pivot around the lip (spicy!), and climb an easy, lower angle offwidth (casual 5.5, but a definite no-fall zone) to the top. There are some tricky subtleties to this crack boulder where you can't just fire it, it will make you think. This a worthy tick for any climber and probably one of the best boulder problems I know of in the South Platte, and it is one of the most scenic and aesthetic boulder problems that I've ever seen. Even if you aren't an offwidth climber, you should get on this!!!\n\nPeople with larger fists can possibly fist jam the entire way and make the climb a few number grades easier (maybe 5.11+ for the meaty bois). People with fists that are almost big enough, well.... It's gonna be rough (will feel stout). Like many crack climbs, the grade on this one is very size-dependent.","protection":"At least 2 pads, a fall from the crux at the lip will be scary but mostly safe with spotters.
