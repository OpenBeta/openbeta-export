It starts as a handcrack then gradually widens to fists then offwidth near where daylight tends to hit the boulder in the winter. Alternatively, you can climb this one as a jug rail or a lieback due to the slight offset and the leaning nature of the crack. It is a really awesome climb.\n\nIf you don't want to commit to the topout, you can step off onto another boulder about 2/3 of the way up.","protection":"Pads.","location":"It is on the north side of the boulder in a cave."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,b1d3d2a7-6fc4-5739-ab04-4cb08768ffc7,0a455671-27cd-5511-ab13-e4506a70ee22,b00f81c6-3dbc-5414-89d8-9c1655fa2bd4,43961fe8-5fd9-52b3-9b1a-15acf9a57398","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Cathedral Spires Area","Cathedral Spires Bouldering","Sunshine Wall Talus Field","Tickle Fight Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.25564,39.41818]},"bbox":[-105.25622206016557,39.41773033981814,-105.25505793983443,39.41862966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120121261","area_id":"Q5Yf6F/ZUrObGhWs+aVzmA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.25622206016557,39.41773033981814],[-105.25505793983443,39.41773033981814],[-105.25505793983443,39.41862966018186],[-105.25622206016557,39.41862966018186],[-105.25622206016557,39.41773033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:15.999Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:49.076Z"}
