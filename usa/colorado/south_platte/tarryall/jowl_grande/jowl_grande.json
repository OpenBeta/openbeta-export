You could maybe combine some things, this was from our ground-up first go.\n\nPitch 1: begin in a lower-angled, hand-sized crack. When the crack runs out, work up and right, before stepping around left to a block in a left-facing corner. Traverse the rail on the top of this block to the right, and pull up into a new hand+ crack. Get a gear belay here, 5.9.\n\nPitch 2: head up the crack until you encounter a roof, placing high in the roof. Crimp up face to the left of the roof with the fist jams for help. Pull over the short face, then head up to the base of a chimney. Get a gear belay here, 5.9+.\n\nPitch 3: run it out up the easier chimney, belaying at the top of the ridge, 5.7.\n\nDescent: head left (up), the top-out ridge, scrambling through boulders until the cliff runs out. Return back down the slope to the base.","protection":"A standard rack to a #3.","location":"It is uphill and to the left of the huge roof with the white spot and before the next large roof in a left-facing corner.
