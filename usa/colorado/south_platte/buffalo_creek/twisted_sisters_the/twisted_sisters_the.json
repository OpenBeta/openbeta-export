You can slab your way up if your good at that sort of thing (probably not 5.7), and there is also another thin, flared crack that runs up the slab just left (maybe harder then 5.7 also). That option cuts off a fair chunk of the dihedral.\n\nI cruised up the dihedral until it got really thin and vegetated at a nice ledge/ramp system at which point I went left up a widish crack to the little tree.  That cut the last 10-20 feet of the dihedral short but seemed better than messing up my ankle in the middle of nowhere trying to clean plants out of the crack and pray for gear since I lost my RPs. We rapped off the tree, and since we had 2 ropes we rigged to pull the webbing when we were on the ground.  So, don't expect any webbing or a formal anchor for that matter for all I know.  Although I didn't go all the way to the notch to see if walking off the back is possible, but I doubt it would be.","protection":"A little bit of everything, some thin gear, maybe some offset gear as some of it may be flared.","location":"It's the obvious feature about half way up the formation."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ggdm/8s6WfqjAnY/NjkN2g==","name":"Unknown (Secret Climb Two)","yds":"5.12","grades":{"yds":"5.12","french":"7b+"},"fa":"??","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.26026,39.37837]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"108093058","mp_crag_id":"106242658","climb_id":"ggdm/8s6WfqjAnY/NjkN2g==","areaRef":"+mcj8OFdU3OvsjS+5PiRzg=="},"content":{"description":"This is the right had of the two parallel crack systems on the south side of Twisted Sister.

I salute the hardman/hardwoman who thinks this route is 5.11.\n\nFor the route: move right around a corner from\n\nWestern Relief\n\n(formerly Moderate Dihedral on this site) and into a gully. On the left wall, 40 feet from\n\nWestern Relief\n\nare two right-arcing cracks, one on top of the other. This route climbs the lower of the two cracks and involves 5.11+ climbing off the ground to pretty solid 5.12 undercling/off-finger awkward jamming with pretty poor feet. The route stays on you but eases up after the first crux and then has a pretty mellow although pumpy finish. Highly recommended but I thought the route was solid 5.12, not 5.11 as Hubbel lists it.
