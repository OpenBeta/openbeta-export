Showcase is an overhanging thin hands crack that gets wider as it goes up.  Starting the route is a tricky stem move.  Once established in the stem you can place a nice .5 (or so) cam, and start cranking.  The rock is extremely sharp, and there aren't many good rests.  It's really sustained, but, I guess I'd say that the crux was at about half-way, going through a short pod.  When it widens up at the top, you can either place wide gear, or put smaller stuff in the back of the crack.  Your call, but, I was glad to have a couple wide pieces (4, & 4.5 cams) for the upper section...  The crack is kinda short (40 or 45 feet?), but will put up a good fight!  It helps to keep your eyes open for features that will help you stem, and smear...  Walk off back, then left.  The climb wouldn't suit a TR very well since the crack can easily swallow a rope.\n\nShowcase is located on the Little Butt near Asshole Rocks.

It is on a huge boulder split in half by a dihedral.  Scramble, and bushwack your way to the base, and climb the dihedral.

This sits near to Asshole Rocks (see Cardiac Crack for more detailed approach info).  To approach, go up 550 for 0.3 miles and park by the yellow \"no motor vehicle\" sign on the left.  Walk up the closed road.  At some point, you will come to a bluff where you can see the whole area (a-hole rocks, da butts, and the surrounding crags).  It is best to get your bearings at this point, and head in the right direction.  At some point, you veer right from the road, and might end up doing some bushwacking to get to any of the crags.  At the view point described above, you will be looking at the back side of Da Butts.  The side with most routes is on the opposite side of the approach.\n\nRoll Dem Bones takes a nice line up the middle of Da Butts, and could be done as 2, or 3 pitches.  We did it in 3 to avoid rope drag.\n\nPitch 1 (9+) is a nice widish hand crack that heads over a roof crack.  The 5.9 section is just one series of moves through the roof, and the crack below it takes perfect #3 cams.  Not too sustained.  We belayed on a ledge about 15-20 feet past the roof.  You could go past this to the next ledge if you used more long slings than I did, or did the 5.7 start.  The belay at this ledge was awkward to set up (extended pieces in a horizontal a few feet up).  You can do a 5.7 starting pitch to this climb called \"\n\nHo De Do\n\n\" about 10 feet to the right (1 bolt).\n\nPicth 2 (5.7) goes up a left leaning crack (small pro helpful) to the next prominant ledge with two rap rings.
