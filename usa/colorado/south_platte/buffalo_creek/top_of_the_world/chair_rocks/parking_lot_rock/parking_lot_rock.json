Work up below a wedged block to get access to the crack and follow it to the top.\n\nThis thing should go free soon but it's a bit harder than it looks - a real bugger of a route for fat fingered people like me. You can clamber up to the wedged block about 10ft up and then stretch real far to get in a nut. From here you have the first crux move to get your feet on top of the block. It's a little heady because you're not that far off the ground yet. From there the crack is tips (for me) with some pods that open up and a higher crux just before the pseudo-jug. Gear is bountiful but strenuous to place. Wrap a large horn/feature up top with webbing and downclimb off to the right and then back.\n\nFeels harder than Thin Ice and a touch harder than Allen's old project to the left of Thin Ice although it may be around the same grade as that if placing gear on it and not just toproping it. Somewhere in the 12+/13- range. I don't know, could be easier for all I know.","protection":"Maybe a hand-sized cam for the start if you'd like and then it's all nuts and Aliens to the top. Be sure to bring plenty of webbing for the top if you're going to TR it.","location":"20ft left of Latch Hand."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,9b246f2e-be52-52a5-a6c2-cdb3e28ecf82,4e645191-6624-5d1e-9521-d33f5e459ea9,f619fd1f-fcbc-5456-862f-bf8ddbb2d748,1e3bb9f3-eace-58fa-b25f-37ad28f9c3c8","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Buffalo Creek","Top Of The World","Chair Rocks","Parking Lot Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.26446,39.42504]},"bbox":[-105.26504211745629,39.42459033981815,-105.26387788254372,39.42548966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106200331","area_id":"Hju58+rOWPqyXzetKPnDyA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:18.118Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:16.375Z"}
