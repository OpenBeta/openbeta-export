Looks like people are walking in. So, here are a few of my favorites.\n\nOn the backside (north side) of Chair Rocks is this great old route. Climb the wide crack on the left side, and finish with a great set of face moves protected by a bolt.\n\nPer\n\nJeremy Hakes\n\n: This route is on the north face of Chair Rocks, the tallest formation on this ranked Jefferson County Peak. The route is on the NE corner, facing north, just east of the large tree. The first 15-20' or so are decent foot/hand jams, but then the crack deepens, widens, and flares as it goes higher. The first pitch is about 170' long. Bring doubles or triples of #3s, 4s, and 5s. No fixed gear exists on P1. About 100' up, a small indentation exists on the climber's right, but it is 2' outside the crack you are climbing. It runs out after about 10'. Then a small indentation crack exists on the climber's left, temping you out of the crack, but no pro exists anywhere but in the crack. It is fairly unenjoyable. The very soft \"arete\" on your left finally dies into a jug, and then the P1 difficulties are over, the grade dropping to 5.4 or so for the last 20+'. A small belay ledge with a pothole exists below the bolts for P2. Not much to build a belay station with up here. P2 goes at a thin 5.9, but is over in about 10', ending with an awkward mantle move. Someone has removed the last bolt protecting this move. Pull up and over onto some sharp crystals, and head over to the main summit block. Cross the off-width (4th class) below you (another route goes up here, but is an awkward bulging squeeze chimney). Cross onto the main summit and tie into the 4 bolts here.","protection":"Wide gear.\n\nPer\n\nJeremy Hakes\n\n: Cams from #2 up to a #5. A #6 would even work in a few spots.
