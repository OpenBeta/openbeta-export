It is the 3rd route from the left. From the ground it looks to have bomber jams. Once you start climbing you will see that the crack is very shallow and flared. If you look hard you can find good pro with micro cams. The crack started to feel insecure about 20 to 30 feet up but I was able to find good face/friction holds (crux).

We stopped at a sharp right corner before the quarry where an old road closed sign is lying on the road.  Walk up this old closed road and you will be atop the slabbo in no time flat.  This is past the trail to the gemstones.\n\nThis route starts just behind a spruce tree on the east face with a sweet but short section of jamming.  Pull through a small bulge and battle wide world (right of bolted 11a friction)to a sweet little section of hands again. Go through some big rock blebs and belay under the chimney.\n\nPitch 2 can either be the cool 5.5 chimney or you can slab up Twoys for Twats, a stiffy lil 10a friction piece.\n\nWalk off right back to the base.  The guide book sshows two sets of anchors near the top of P1.  The set labeled 70' we never saw, the set labeled 120' has had the hangers removed.  Its worth it to go to the top anyway.\n\nIf P1 was longer and less wandery this would easily be a 2 star route, its pretty cool.","protection":"Standard south platte rack to 4\"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,9b246f2e-be52-52a5-a6c2-cdb3e28ecf82,4e645191-6624-5d1e-9521-d33f5e459ea9,201f4118-b5d2-5038-bc0a-ec23a6bd931e","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Buffalo Creek","Top Of The World","Slabbo"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.22096,39.39951]},"bbox":[-105.22154190434394,39.39906033981814,-105.22037809565607,39.39995966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105942885","area_id":"IB9BGLXSUDi8Cuwjpr2THg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:18.115Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:17:00.432Z"}
