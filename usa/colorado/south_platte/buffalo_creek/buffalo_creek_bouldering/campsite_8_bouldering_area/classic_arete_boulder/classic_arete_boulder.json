I couldn't top out as I didn't feel good commiting with only 2 pads and no spotter.  I can't say exactly how hard the top is once the seam dies out, probably 2 or 3 hard moves. Most of the problem is probably V1-V2.","protection":"3-5 pads; 1-2 spotters, a rope would be nice for getting down.","location":"This is 1/4- 1/2 mile down the road from\n\ndeGaulle's Nose free route\n\non the right in an opening."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,3008c0fb-0ce5-525b-b50f-6155887d0597,9b246f2e-be52-52a5-a6c2-cdb3e28ecf82,7fc99638-5c15-5519-b90a-31c4a8427b87,55e3173e-69fc-58c7-b939-49ce51d809a1,8c31e3a6-bb2f-5420-8f77-1adde5c79fe6","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","South Platte","Buffalo Creek","Buffalo Creek Bouldering","Campsite #8 Bouldering Area","Classic Arete Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3-4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.26055,39.37925]},"bbox":[-105.26113173541624,39.378800339818135,-105.25996826458373,39.37969966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119789443","area_id":"jDHjprsvVCCPdxrd5cef5g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:18.797Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:18.030Z"}
