The problem tackles a 45 degree left-leaning and 15 degree overhanging ringlocks to thin hands crack. Sit start as low as possible on an okay left, thin hand jam below a pod and a shitty right hand in the fingers bit, with an okay right foot hold. This problem requires a high level of body tension and good technique to be successful. It is short but mean and a bit easier than \"\n\nIn Rainbows\n\n\" but not by much.... However some people have told me that this is the harder of the two climbs. Perhaps this one is hand- and foot-size dependent?\n\nYou can probably lay this one back, but it's more fun as a straight-in crack and way better in style.","protection":"Just one pad.","location":"GPS coordinates are: 39.335346, -105.271272.
