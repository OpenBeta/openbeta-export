It's pretty stout for sure.","protection":"Large cams mostly, you can use some smaller stuff for the anchor up top. Doubles in the #3-5 Camalot range would be useful, don't remember if I used my #6 or not but maybe bring it just in case.  If you plan to boulder this thing, bring about 5 pads or maybe more, as there are a few large rocks in the landing and a fire ring as well.","location":"Continue down 550 past\n\nde Gaulles Nose\n\nfor a while, there is a large parking area that is surrounded by cable on your right (close to the Gnome Dome), park there.  Follow the bike trail across the street up towards A-hole rock (stay left at the split and you will pass some rocks on your left shortly which have maybe 2-3 boulderable cracks), you will eventually make out a super faint clearing just off the trail to your right (a bit further down the trail) that was actually once an old road, follow it up the hill to the ridge line. Follow the ridge until you find the boulder pictured the problem faces A-hole, so you won't see it at first just check all the boulders on the ridge if you can't figure it out. It's maybe 1/3 to 1/2 way to A-hole rock."},"__v":0},{"_id":"QwkNn4tuVjCKzsyoXUo3Tg==","name":"Highball Fingercrack","yds":"5.12d","grades":{"yds":"5.12d","french":"7c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"bouldering":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.26025,39.37837]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"120859545","mp_crag_id":"119736981","climb_id":"QwkNn4tuVjCKzsyoXUo3Tg==","areaRef":"T8clLNAvXqSvu4+KR4c1ZA=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the finger crack/tips crack left of \"\n\nSmoke a Fatty\n\n\".
