Start in the cave on good hand jams, then work your way into fists until it gets too wide and you are forced to invert into the offwidth. This one is a fighter and a difficult size (for me at least) - a couple laps on this one and you will be ready for the bigger OW roofs in the Platte. If you can fit your knee in the crux, this will feel more like V3....\n\nYou can start this one further back in the cave, but the rock quality is not as good.","protection":"At least 2 pads.
