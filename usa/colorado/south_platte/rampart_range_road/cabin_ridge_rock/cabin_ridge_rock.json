Climb all the way into the wide crack at the bottom to the back of the crack where you start to head up. Work your way up the chimney to get first piece of pro way in the back of the crack. I felt the crux of this pitch was getting out of the top where the back of the crack is broken rock providing only marginal protection and having to work your way toward the front of the crack if you are larger to exit. The second pitch is more squeeze chimney. Protection is found in horizontal and vertical crack, but like the first pitch, it runs out towards to top.","protection":"A standard rack.
