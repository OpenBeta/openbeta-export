It is an excellent first trad lead as it accepts pieces of all sizes at some point in the climb, and constrictions can be found often for gear of all types.\n\nFollow the crack up to the bulge at the top of the cliff, mantel over, and use the tree for an anchor.\n\nEither rappel back down or walk off.","protection":"Single cams from fingers to hands - a BD #5 is useful for protecting the low crux. Nuts and Hexes could likely be subbed out for the cams, but who uses either of those these days?","location":"From the top of Alliteration Slab above the anchor access for Dogshit Direct/Four Fs, cross the brush gully, and go through the opening to the left.
