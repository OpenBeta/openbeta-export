There are so many reasons not to like this route, it becomes impossible not to love it.  Lots of decomposing rock, lack of a true summit, and the fact that you will need to lug giant gear up the terrible trail-less approach are all evidence that effort = enjoyment.\n\nBut seriously, if you own tons of big gear and you want practice on an easy squeeze chimney, this is a fun route.  Stem, chimney, and squirm your way up till the chimney splits.  The right side continues up a mossy groove.  At the big, rotten, down-facing spike, exit left and up an easy off-width crack to the top.\n\nGear Beta\n\nUsing a #5 and #6 you can protect the first half by back cleaning them from safe stances.  When the crack gets steep and wide, leave the #5 as high as possible then the #6.  If you don't ever want to be above your gear, there is a small runout section before you can get another #6.  This section could be protected with a Valley Giant or blue Big bro.  But it's not necessary since the chimney is so secure.  A #4 protects the exit left.  I used a #5 for the final crack, but if you didn't have another one, a #4, #3, or even a #2 might do the job....","protection":"1-#4, 2-#5s, 2-#6s; something for an anchor (many options between 0.75 and #4), optional #4 Big bro (blue).","location":"Find the bolt routes on the South face of the Mega Dome.  This is the first big crack uphill to the right.\n\nFrom the top ,walk down a ramp to the left.  You can rap from cold shuts above the route,\n\nLeft Hand of Darkness\n\n.  A 70m will just make it to the starting ledge of that route, but the downclimb from there is a little sketchy and the rope pull is hard.  You might want to have a 2nd rope handy for the rappel...."},"__v":0},{"_id":"YQzLYbMmWKyMsV5g3a53FQ==","name":"Left Hand of Darkness","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"George Watson, Gene Ellis 10/1991","type":{"sport":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.05589,39.29141]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107765346","mp_crag_id":"107765236","climb_id":"YQzLYbMmWKyMsV5g3a53FQ==","areaRef":"MBuhaW5MWh2iwO5DCWIPtg=="},"content":{"description":"This climb starts off a large boulder leaned against the wall.
