The tough climbing is well-protected.  I had to use several points of aid but I think free climbing is totally reasonable.\n\nPitch 1. 100', 5.10+.  Start up the corner through a short section of flakes and blocks.  Climb into perfect hands to a pod, pull a roof and wrestle the steep, cupped hand crack to a two bolt anchor.\n\nPitch 2. 60-70', 5.11.  Continue up the corner through another blocky section followed by a hand crack that goes to super tight hands at a steep angle.  Then get mentaly prepared to traverse about 20' right under a giant roof protected with a black Alien size and some other finger sizes.  Make the exposed moves around to a huge ledge.  I looked for a good spot to belay but found none on the ledge and decided to climb the giant flake to the other side.  On the east side of the flake I made an anchor with #3 Camalot sizes.  The other option I saw was to belay after passing the roof also on the same cams, this would ease rope drag but make for a crammed and uncomfortable belay.\n\nPitch 3. 20-30', 5.8R.  A face climb.  Climb up the flake to the top and stuff 2 or 3 cams in a shallow, horizontal seam and then go for it.  Not so scary, but the protection does not inspire confidence.  Belay on cracks on a big boulder on top.\n\nI would belay your partner to the rap station as it requires a short downclimb.  Throw the rope over the boulder on top and do a quick body belay so you can access the 2 bolt rap station on the northeast corner of the tower.  An eighty foot rap gets you to the ground.  Scamble southeast back down to your gear.","protection":"One set of Aliens.  Camalot sizes: 4 sets of #1, #2, #3, two #4s, and a #0.75.  5-8 long runners, new webbing for the rappel, and one 60m rope.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,900e6b35-1080-560d-a3e7-747b48b3a3b5,61b7b3d7-6b29-5c39-868a-7f5aa262edf8,e3e177e1-e8f3-599e-b042-5d979421bb8a,f7fd3937-d543-5fcc-a2f2-7e0f95e617df","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Naturita and Paradox Valley","Big Gypsum - Dolores","Hamm Canyon","Tower Of Power"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-108.8093,38.0967]},"bbox":[-108.80987138119906,38.096250339818134,-108.80872861880091,38.097149660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107556978","area_id":"9/05N9VDX8yi8n4PleYX3w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-108.80987138119906,38.096250339818134],[-108.80872861880091,38.096250339818134],[-108.80872861880091,38.097149660181856],[-108.80987138119906,38.097149660181856],[-108.80987138119906,38.096250339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:22.118Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:28.669Z"}
