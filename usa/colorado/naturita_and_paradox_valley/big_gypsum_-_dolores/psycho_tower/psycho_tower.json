This is a fine route on a fine tower - a must do for those who appreciate a good summit.\n\nAlthough generously bolted, this isn't a sport climb. Trad gear and skills are needed!\n\nPitch 1: start from a bolted anchor at the saddle on the north side. Follow two bolts up and step right (big air!!) into a crack / corner. Climb this to a ledge, up a step to another ledge (fixed nut), past the rap anchor on the left up a short corner to yet another ledge up and right.\n\nPitch 2: follow bolts to the right. It seems a little airy at the start, but you haven't seen anything yet! You arrive at an amazing stance at the left of the huge beak. Three more bolts take you right and up to a large ledge. The topo says \"exposed\" and Charlie's not kidding. The pucker factor is at max here. Your feet are just inches above the void - a fall would leave you hanging in space. I'd suggest leaving a long sling on the middle bolt to pull up on if you blow the move - lowering out is NOT an option! This has just as much air as\n\nRosy Crucifixion\n\nexcept you're even more in space than that. Fortunately this spot isn't long and the bolts are close together. It is easily aided by pulling on biners (I should know ...).\n\nThis pitch gains little elevation and takes you almost 180 degrees around the tower.\n\nPitch 3: follow 4 bolts and a short crack to the top. This has a few hard moves (9+) but is well protected.\n\nMany of the hard moves were height-dependent - shorter climbers found the crux easier but other parts harder.","protection":"The first pitch takes a variety of cams from #3 or 4 down to small ones.  A couple of hand-size cams are needed on the last pitch.","location":"Start from the \"crow's nest\" like saddle on the north side of the tower.  A double bolt anchor marks the belay stance.  A short but exposed section of 4th class leads to the start.\n\nRap in one 150' or two 75' drops.
