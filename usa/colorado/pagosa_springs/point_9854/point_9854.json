I bet someone with some real cojones could also free climb this route (5.11-12 R).\n\nStart on the east side of the tower, and free climb on extremely chossy, volcanic tuff toward the neck of the tower (5.4 PG-13). Spectres and slings protect this section (poorly). Once at the neck, aid your way to a small ledge (A2). From the ledge, free climb on better rock (still questionable) and a bit runout to the summit (5.6).\n\nRappel south from a bolted anchor.","protection":"3 rivet hangers or nuts and a select rack of peckers, Spectres, Lost Arrows, and z-pins (my MVP). Also bring a select single set of cams up to BD C4 #5 with tri-cams. Screamers are also advised.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,d1afba1d-6cc9-597f-acb2-c9eb2afac5cf,a84def20-057f-579e-b404-f13a9b2b1573","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Pagosa Springs","Point 9,854"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.18998,37.50035]},"bbox":[-107.19054678691165,37.499900339818126,-107.18941321308837,37.500799660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113735667","area_id":"qE3vIAV/V560BPE6mysVcw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:23.418Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:24.485Z"}
