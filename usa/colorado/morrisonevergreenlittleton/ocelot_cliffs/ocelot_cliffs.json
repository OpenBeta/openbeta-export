I came in from the right at about the same height as the 2nd bolt. Above the 2nd bolt, enter the crack for 90' of crack climbing. Near the top, after clipping the piton (sticking out 1/4\" but good), step right then back left to a short crack finish and a two bolt rap anchor. I really liked this climb! A 70m rope is a MUST HAVE to rap + a short easy downclimb.","protection":"A standard rack + an old style #4.5 Camalot, extra finger-size cams, + an extra #2 Camalot.","location":"Of the two cliffs, this is on the eastern (rightmost) Ocelot Cliff. As you walk along the base of the cliff from left-to-right, you drop down about 20'. Before this drop, the ground goes up 20' to meet a steep gully. To the left of this gully is the route with 2 bolts below a crack that goes to the summit. The bolts maybe part of another climb that lead diagonally left, but they are used on this climb to get to the crack."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,6cc0c3ef-2ec2-5348-8d10-2741c38624f2,e50d2d97-14aa-54b1-b884-ac0a2b3603e5","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Morrison/Evergreen/Littleton","Ocelot Cliffs"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.30366,39.59266]},"bbox":[-105.30424352343722,39.59221033981815,-105.30307647656278,39.593109660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108042957","area_id":"5Q0tlxSqVLG4hKwKKzYD5Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:20.943Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:21.472Z"}
