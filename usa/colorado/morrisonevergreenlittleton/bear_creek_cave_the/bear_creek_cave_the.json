Bouldery and steep... not a traditional \"gear\" climb. Blocky and foreboding. Gear is hard to get but solid. The are no bolts on this climb and no anchors, rather it is a walk off from the top. After mid height on the climb, the rock goes to shit so be careful, luckily the climbing at the end is no harder than 5.10. This climb is not ultra classic; however, it's unique and rather wild.","protection":"Small rack up to #2 Camalot.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,6cc0c3ef-2ec2-5348-8d10-2741c38624f2,96b846d7-41a4-53ed-9d25-d291a15f0a46","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Morrison/Evergreen/Littleton","Bear Creek Cave, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.195,39.6548]},"bbox":[-105.19558404766073,39.654350339818144,-105.19441595233927,39.65524966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106128059","area_id":"lrhG10GkU+2dJdKRoV8KRg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:21.660Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:22.609Z"}
