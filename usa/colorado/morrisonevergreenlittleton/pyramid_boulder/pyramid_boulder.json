There is a solid stance below the roof where you can reach up if you're lanky or dyno if you're bold, and find a nice, flat dish filled with dirt at the top of the roof that works as jugs. Use the dusty crimp in this dish if you need more grip as you pull over the top to top out, and walk off!","protection":"A pad is good.","location":"This route is around the corner to the right of Pyramid Boulder, if you're looking at Pyramid Boulder from the front. Climb around the corner over some bushes from pyramid or bushwhack around and up the hill to this wide, diagonal, slanted microcrag in the hill with fun easy traverse lines across it. I first found this side of Pyramid Boulder climbing the dirty rocks up the chimney/gully behind Pyramid, which shares the same topout as this problem.
