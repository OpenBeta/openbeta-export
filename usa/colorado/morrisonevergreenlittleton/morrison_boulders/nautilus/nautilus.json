Starts on the right side by the Cave and goes all the way across to the left. Lower is harder, higher is easier. Maybe could be called V2 if you know where the good holds are. There are endless possibilities for straight up problems all across the wall, but they're almost all contrived. If we're going to submit an area, there may as well be routes there right? So here is one for the Cave Area, otherwise known as Nautilus. This traverse is a fun one to get a nice burn on doing laps after greasing off the latest contrived variation to Helicopter in the Hole.","protection":"None.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"RiO0+xoqXs20aYL42VSvsg==","name":"League","yds":"V0","grades":{"yds":"V0","font":"4","vscale":"V0"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.18734,39.6535]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"111349847","mp_crag_id":"105745714","climb_id":"RiO0+xoqXs20aYL42VSvsg==","areaRef":"gUDhxTQZV0KubqG6CaiUDw=="},"content":{"description":"This route starts in the center of the\n\ntraverse\n\n, about 10 feet to the right of the crack and heads straight up on jugs.
