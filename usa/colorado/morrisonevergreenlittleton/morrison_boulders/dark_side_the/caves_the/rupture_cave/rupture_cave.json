Start from the main area (Breashears' Crack), and head west up the trail. You will have to mount 3 large boulders while heading west. Once you reach the farthest west boulder (large and short), head south straight up the hill. You will see one arete that is pretty cool. Directly behind this is a large problem that has an A-shape. You start on underclings and head up a rail of perfect slopers. Then you either jump or reach for a perfect sloper out right. It then continues straight up the rock.\n\nThis is a superb problem. It is in a quasi-cave system and has ferns and such growing out the rock. The slopers are exquisite,  and it is definitely a must do.","protection":"You will need multiple pads for this one.
