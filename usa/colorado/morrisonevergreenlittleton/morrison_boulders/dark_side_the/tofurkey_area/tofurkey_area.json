Work your way up to a strong left hand on the arete and a good multi-finger pocket for the right hand. From here, smear your feet, and get to the lip. From the lip, pull up, get into the deep crack on top, and finish it up.\n\nThe most difficult part of the problem is likely to avoid the boulder just off to the left of the problem. It definitely can get in the way a bit at first.\n\nThis route is being added so that it can be enjoyed all in its own.
