There is a row of handholds that arcs across the lower section of the face, these are the feet for this problem.  The top of the boulder is off.  The idea is to traverse across the face from right to left using only the thin seam and the mid-height crimper-edge for handholds.  I've heard people call it the \"5.12\" problem which would warrant the V4 rating.  The difference between 3 or 4 on this one is the usage of a small edge just below the top that is above and slightly left of the mid-height hold.  Without this hold it is necessary to match on the midheight hold to make it to the other side.  I know this is really contrived, but it is also a unique problem for Morrison in that it is very balancy and footwork intensive, so I thought people might enjoy it.
