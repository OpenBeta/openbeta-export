Sit start on jugs.  Pull big moves utilizing a bomber toe hook.  The first crux is a throw while cutting your feet, the second is finding the best way to control the jug at the end of the roof.  From the jug, make a small move with the right hand to a descent hold, then a loooong pull to a fairly shallow 2 finger pocket.  Lock off to the jug and finesse your way to the top....\n\nAWESOME!\n\nIf you're not a V12 climber, stopping at the jug at the lip is V9ish and is well worth the time.","protection":"Pads.","location":"This is on the left side of the roof of the Cave Boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"MVaHqSRwUsOjn+cyuZ4iUg==","name":"Fantasia","yds":"V13","grades":{"yds":"V13","font":"8B","vscale":"V13"},"fa":"Daniel Woods","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.20882,39.6813]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"116156160","mp_crag_id":"106035333","climb_id":"MVaHqSRwUsOjn+cyuZ4iUg==","areaRef":"rw69WqO5Wq6JAuA870eNCg=="},"content":{"description":"Start sitting on the right side of the cave on a low left hand crimp and with your right hand on the seam. Bump left up to the sidepull, make a hard right hand move to the crimpy pinch, and get into the jugs in the cave somehow. There are a few different ways to do this sequence. Once in the cave, throw a large right hand cross, cut your feet, and walk them out to the bicycle. Through some more cave climbing trickery, work your way to the jug rail right before the pocket on\n\nBambi\n\n, and finish out there.\n\nThis route is 20+ moves long and has classic cave climbing with surprisingly good flow.
