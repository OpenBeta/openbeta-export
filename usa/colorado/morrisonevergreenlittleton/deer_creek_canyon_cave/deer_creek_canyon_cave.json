On the last couple laybacks, keep your feet up and use them to push off and get a little extra reach. Once you're on the far right side of the boulder, pull up and dart your left hand out for the final crux move.  An easy V1 traverse to the left taking you over top the cave will get you down on the far left side of the cave.","protection":"Best to bring 2 or 3 crash pads and a spotter, the landing is on a bit of a slope with a few boulders.","location":"Take West Deer Creek Canyon Rd (aka CO Rd 124) from 470 and Kippling or 470 and Wadsworth.  After passing Valley Rd, its 2.4 miles up the hill on the left hand (south) side of the road.  Just two corners (1000ft) down the hill from Deer Creek Crag.  There's a small dirt pull off that can handle 3 or 4 cars, a little brown sign saying \"Jefferson County.  Dumping Prohibited\".  You'll need to cross the creek.  Currently there are large boulders and a tree across the creek so you don't need to get wet but in spring run off its likely you'll need to get wet."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ab48aed5-2e8d-54bb-b099-6140fe1f098f,6cc0c3ef-2ec2-5348-8d10-2741c38624f2,d53a7a53-37d4-5cf9-8c8c-d2c1f6f1ffa5","pathTokens":["USA","Colorado","Morrison/Evergreen/Littleton","Deer Creek Canyon Cave"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.1783,39.5407]},"bbox":[-105.1788830863419,39.54025033981814,-105.1777169136581,39.541149660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107311864","area_id":"1Tp6UzfUXPmMjNLB9vH/pQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.1788830863419,39.54025033981814],[-105.1777169136581,39.54025033981814],[-105.1777169136581,39.541149660181865],[-105.1788830863419,39.541149660181865],[-105.1788830863419,39.54025033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:21.660Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:27.752Z"}
