It is a great cruiser warm-up that will give you an introduction to what the climbing is like at the UAC.  Starts with a left-facing flake and cruxes early.

Take care on the bushwhack up as it gets deceptively close to the edge.","protection":"Top rope anchor - a block slung with a cable.\n\nApparently, someone (not the original developers) has bolted this route for leading.
