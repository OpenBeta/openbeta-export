Be careful as these roof holds are questionable in there strength!!\n\nMove out towards the lip of the roof via nice jugs.  Pull onto the lip and toss up a crazy, right heel hook.

From here, move up with your right into a small but good three finger pocket and get your right up higher on a sloping but positive hold.  Get your feet straight and pull hard up and left to a some what hidden jug that saves the day.\n\nThis is an intense problem because of the quality of the rock, level of difficultly and the terrible land that you could face if any hold were to break or you just ran out of steam at the top.\n\nAll that aside...this is a fun and dynamic climbing adventure that keeps you on edge.
