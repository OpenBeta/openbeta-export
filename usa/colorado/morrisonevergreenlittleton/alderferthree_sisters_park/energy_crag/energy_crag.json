Make sure your hands are placed in the correct order before starting out or you are sure to have victory stolen from you.\n\nWhen ready, aggressively bump up to a small, right hand crimp with a pinky catch then quickly make a long toss (again with your right hand) to a small, sloping, horizontal seam. Move your left foot on to a nice tip-like foot hold located on your starting hold.\n\nNext bring up your left had up into a match and quickly switch feet. Get your left foot in a good back step position and toss up and left into a two finger, pocket-type feature.\n\nSteady yourself for the grand finally and explode upwards (2-3 foot dyno) with your right hand to snag an in-cut jug.\n\nNow that the hard part is over get a shake and finish by pushing on to easier but committing climbing to the finish. Possibly the best problem at The Sisters.\n\nIf the sequence is not done in a fairly precise way, it will surely seem much harder. Also a big key to sending this sweet heart is good momentum.\n\nThis problem is also much harder if you are short.
