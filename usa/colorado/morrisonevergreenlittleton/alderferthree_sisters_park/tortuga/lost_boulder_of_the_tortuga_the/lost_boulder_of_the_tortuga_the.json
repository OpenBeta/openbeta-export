Past your feet under the steep wall and move up into a slopy horizontal then work straight up onto a nasty sloping pinch on the lip of the upper overhang.  Slap your way up and onto this wall/block (crux) to the finish.  Walk off the back.\n\nThis line has also been done by moving and following the horizontal crack out and right thus avoiding the crux and lowering the difficulty by about one or two V-grades.  Making the line more like (V2).\n\nSo for full value stay the course and pull straight up and over the nasty hard overhang above the horizontal.  This line is power!!! and technique!!!  Really fun climbing on steep terrain.  It's a must!!","protection":"Pads and a Spot.","location":"From \"Pirates Cove\" just head north towards the \"Tortuga Area\" and keep looking to your right.
