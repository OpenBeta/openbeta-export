I topped out the route in a late summer, sudden, snow squall. This route ascends a steep pink face with a splitter crack on excellent stone.\n\nBeta alert: the route starts by scrambling up below a V-shape roof, an optional nut where the roof meets the sloped ledge protects the moves to the first bolt.  Clip the bolt and pull yourself onto the sloped ledge to the right. Clip the next bolt and pull up to a good stance just above the bolt. There are optional micro cam placements in the diagonal seam to protect the next easy moves to attain the crack splitting the face abov.  Climb the crack to just below its end and pull up and right onto a large, angling ledge. Climb up and left on the ledge until you can reach a bolt at the lip of the roof. Clip the bolt and crank up on positive holds. A 2 inch cam placement in a horizontal out right protects the next moves onto the ledge above.
