Sds all the way down and left on a nice jug rail. Climb the very clear seam to its conclusion all the way on the right side of the overhang. Make two difficult dynos with brilliant holds to join the next seam, which traverses back out left over the abyss. Top out very high above a horrible landing. This long and committing problem offers incredible movement on solid rock (though lots of smaller bits are still cleaning up) and is a true gem of a line.","protection":"Many pads. 4 were used on the FA, but consider that an absolute minimum. Don’t fall of the top. It won’t be a good sight for the drivers on I-70.","location":"This ascends the perfect line of least resistance climbing the full overhang.
