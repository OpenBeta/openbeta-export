The Left Crack might have an actual name by the first ascentionist but I like calling it \"Ludwigs\" (5.12). Ludwigs has a very fun and balancy technical crux at the end of the crack. This eliminate is a super hard onsight but once you know how to grab the holds and where to put your feet its much easier (like any technical crux).

Add boulder problems to that sub-area. Sunny sandstone crag in the lower peninsula of Michigan right on the Grand River. The cliff is 40ish feet tall and offers bouldery, challenging routes.

It exists in Oak Park, which is managed by the city of Grand Ledge.  Fitzgerald Park, across the river, does not allow climbing at any time for any reason and was part of the concession the climbing community accepted for continued access at Oak Park. While the rock quality is pretty good on established classics, other areas can be quite chossy, so be careful.Unique Rules to Grand Ledge:(1) No lead climbing.(2) Must place carpet below your anchors to protect cliff from erosion. You will see how soft the rock is and all the marking from webbing and rope.(3) No Rappelling."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":59,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:33.938Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:32.918Z"}
