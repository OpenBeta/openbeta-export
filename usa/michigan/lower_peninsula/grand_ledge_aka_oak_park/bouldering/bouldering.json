This side of the cliff tends to stay more in the shade and can remain damp after rain much longer. Bouldering in the center of cliff--from ballerina to Despondency--tends to be steeper and more powerful. This area also gets direct sunlight. As many of these problems intersect and share top rope climbs, be courteous. Below is a list of the projects, classics, better climbs and the sub areas within the park.  Although the band of rock is relatively small, there are distinct areas within it and is useful to understand their locations as the locals will refer to them by these names and its just easier to find the problem you are looking for.  The list starts on the East Wall which would be to the left walking out of the parking lot.*** See Map that is in the photo section for orientation to the problems.https://www.mountainproject.com/photo/121930624"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":119,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:33.939Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:33.242Z"}
