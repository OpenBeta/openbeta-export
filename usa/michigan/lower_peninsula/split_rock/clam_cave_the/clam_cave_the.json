Frames Lake Huron's beach and is nearby some vacation homes. This band is near but separate from the \"A,C,J boulder\" as it is located on the sand rather than in the tides, about 15 meters South of it. Lots of tagging and hideous spray paint litters the cliff band, a sign you're close, but this area/cave is relatively clean."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:33.939Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:32.943Z"}
