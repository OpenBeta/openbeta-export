Unclimbable in the summer due to the looseness of the rock, in the winter large ice seeps form.  The cliff band produces three major ice climbing areas- \"Big Red\", \"Little Red\", and Freda Falls.  Access either comes from a forest road off of Freda road (CoRd S-554) or from walking the ice shelf in the winter.  Belaying takes place on the lake.  Conditions may be extremely cold and windy in the winter."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:35.458Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:13.566Z"}
