Somewhat tall, with excellent views of Lake Superior, the Huron Islands, and a cluster of other mountains in the Huron range. Start in the left corner of the slab where the ground slopes down to it's lowest point. Sit for starting position with both hands on the obvious (diagonal) rail. From here travel up, wandering slightly left to the top-out. Crux is near the top where the handholds/feet are slightly worse than the rest.","protection":"One or two pads will do, although the blueberry bushes at the base may suffice if you forgot your pad ;)","location":"A slabby bit of rock exposed along the NW edge of Ghost Peak. Easiest to locate by hiking to the peak and following the top of the drop-off (~50 foot vertical wall that runs along the entire North Face) down until you find the fairly obvious nook. There are several other great bouldering opportunities in this same nook as well as near here, including a highball slab that has yet to be climbed. 46°52'04.8\"N 88°01'33.7\"W"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,d358cccb-6f86-58bf-9cb1-347cf49788c9,73c3700f-4c74-5a14-a1f8-c10179b1ea45,b48325cf-038c-552e-a632-63449fd29823,07c41d80-a90e-52b7-94b6-924ce4fcd90c","pathTokens":["USA","Michigan","Upper Peninsula","Little Huron River Range","Ghost peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.0271,46.86752]},"bbox":[-88.0277576983329,46.86707033981814,-88.0264423016671,46.867969660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113006839","area_id":"B8QdgKkOUreUtpJM5PzZDA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-88.0277576983329,46.86707033981814],[-88.0264423016671,46.86707033981814],[-88.0264423016671,46.867969660181856],[-88.0277576983329,46.867969660181856],[-88.0277576983329,46.86707033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Ghost is lower then other surrounding peaks, but is quit exposed.
