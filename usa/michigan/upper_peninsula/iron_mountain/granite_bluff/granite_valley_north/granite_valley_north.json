Routes in the north valley vary in height, but highball potential is there. Further development will require cleaning, and boulders on the west end of the valley may be more difficult to access due to standing water when temps are above freezing. Current developed routes are arranged L to R when facing south (looking at the boulders)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:34.402Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:33.854Z"}
