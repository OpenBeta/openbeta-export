An excellent place to take your friends that are new to climbing, with a sub-ten minute approach hike through some classic U.P. state land, follow blazes to the wall. This crag is all quartzite and slippery when wet, the bolted routes are all well protected and there is a ton of room for top rope anchors. To hike around to the top, follow the crag map to the west along the thin trail halfway up the wall, then cut in going uphill (north) after a staircase at the big red pine. The view from the top is great and it has potential for a bit of camping, not to mention it’s out of the mosquitos and great for sunsets! This crag is a great place for new climbers, with plenty of options for more difficult grades in the future, the variety of easy terrain and good holds make it ideal for those that don’t have climbing shoes, a stiff hiking shoe will do the trick!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":27,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:33.946Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:33.401Z"}
