Split grade is given for two variations\n\n Matt originally climbed the route by compressing the double arête feature with left hand on a blocky side-pull, right on a small triangle side-pull, and a knee bar.\n\n The other, slightly harder version starts matched on a blocky ledge on the right arête. Then climbs up a few feet before transitioning to the compression section and topping out. This way adds a few VERY high quality moves and makes the crux slightly harder, but less reachy. It's also more congruent with the sit start.","protection":"A pad or two","location":"Right side of the Death Star outcrop."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,d358cccb-6f86-58bf-9cb1-347cf49788c9,73c3700f-4c74-5a14-a1f8-c10179b1ea45,c70503bc-949d-5366-b886-f253987ddc38,c9c3e9b7-83e5-57e6-b607-cb8370a5c9db,8f2a87ad-8a5b-5674-b548-cc52c5aaecbd,153bc722-944e-5267-8937-90b6d93067b0,376435ee-f6a7-5765-8ef1-2265def8ca63","pathTokens":["USA","Michigan","Upper Peninsula","Marquette (and Central UP) Bouldering","550 Bouldering","Wetmore Pond Trailhead","Wetmore Pond","Death Star Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V-easy"},{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"V9"},{"count":1,"label":"V4-5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.46644,46.60251]},"bbox":[-87.46709447414905,46.60206033981814,-87.46578552585099,46.60295966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118744133","area_id":"N2Q17vanV2WO8SJl3vjKYw=="},"content":{"description":"An unusually featured, west facing outcrop."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:34.999Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:37.614Z"}
