Allthough it has been climbed for years and is located right on the trail it sees little traffic. The climbs are short, steep, and sweet here. As of the time of this writing \"Flying Frog Roof\" led by Brandon Snyder in 2009 has still not seen a second accent!! The trad climbing here can be chllanging because of the short nature of the routes. A crash pad is recomended for padding the base when leading the roof. \n\n The Slab Wall has great moderate top rope routes as well. Be considerate when climbing on the slab as it is right on the trail, try to keep gear and ropes clear of the trail best as you can."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:35.875Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:12.959Z"}
