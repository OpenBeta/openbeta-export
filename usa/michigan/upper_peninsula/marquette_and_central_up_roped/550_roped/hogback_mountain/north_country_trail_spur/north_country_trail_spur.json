It has a few roped climbs but the main attraction of the area is the long vertical to overhaging bouldering cut. As of this writing there have been no climbs done on the cut but as the informations get out it shold be on any serious boulder's radar. Being that it can be accesed from the Harlow Lake Pathway it could be part of an amazing boulder circuit!!!Â "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:35.877Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:14.188Z"}
