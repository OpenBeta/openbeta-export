The route takes 9 bolts up clean slab climbing into a small overhang that puts you on the pitch one ledge with a two bolt anchor(no rings). From there 5 bolts lead out onto another clean slab with nice exposure to ring anchors at the top. A 60m rope will touch base if rappelling in or to pull ropes. If setting a top rope from the rings use a redirect on the first pitch anchors.
