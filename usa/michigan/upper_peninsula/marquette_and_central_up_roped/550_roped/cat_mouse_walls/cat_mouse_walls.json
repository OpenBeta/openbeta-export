Fun, well protected, moderate climbing with great summit views of Lake Superior and all the peaks of 550.Pitch 1: Climb the jagged, right angling crack. Big feature climbing with crack protection and comfortable stances. A beautiful line. Anchor off the Red Pine just left of the top out. 50' 5.5.Pitch 2: From the top of pitch 1, walk right about 30' to the dihedral crack system with several stepped overhangs. A little more technical and airy than pitch 1, some smaller holds, stemming, and a few mantles will bring you to a bolted anchor at the top. Big thanks to Brandon Snyder for installing the bolts and saving many future anchor building headaches 50' 5.6.","protection":"Standard rack to 4 inches","location":"The only cleaned part of the wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,d358cccb-6f86-58bf-9cb1-347cf49788c9,73c3700f-4c74-5a14-a1f8-c10179b1ea45,9da9329f-041c-536f-a6e9-4127e1a7d3fa,2bdb8fae-12aa-5751-b28e-bc815480792e,7a127784-d7c8-5ec8-b04d-4590a5749929","pathTokens":["USA","Michigan","Upper Peninsula","Marquette (and Central UP) Roped","550 Roped","Cat & Mouse Walls"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-87.47264,46.61405]},"bbox":[-87.47329461359817,46.61360033981813,-87.47198538640183,46.614499660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119870728","area_id":"ehJ3hNfIXsiwTUWQpXSZKQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-87.47329461359817,46.61360033981813],[-87.47198538640183,46.61360033981813],[-87.47198538640183,46.614499660181856],[-87.47329461359817,46.614499660181856],[-87.47329461359817,46.61360033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"Two tall, slabby outcrops stacked on top of each other on the north side of the Sand Lot ridge."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:07:35.467Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:35.303Z"}
