Mantle over.\n\n Very safe Walk Off.\n\n This problem is accessible for a warm-up or newer climbers and challenges balance and trusting foot placements over crimp or upper body strength as the hueco and low-ball help train mantling.  Moving on to Look Harder finish will necessitate considerable core and pinch strength and far more difficult mantle. \n\n Vid Beta: youtu.be/btZSOeshCkY","protection":"","location":"34.744753 , -98.544938\n\n Just My Reflection Boulder sits on the south slope of Hunting Horse Hill on the dividing line between trails that follow the West or East slopes."},"__v":0},{"_id":"SOL5TIsVU4qPqsyEWQkcjw==","name":"Look Harder","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.54495,34.74475]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"118805159","mp_crag_id":"118805127","climb_id":"SOL5TIsVU4qPqsyEWQkcjw==","areaRef":"Z2JYt0k+WLWJeCAnmLwlOA=="},"content":{"description":"Follow the same progression as Remember Who You Area but continue under roof past the right foot kickstand stem position and compress under the roof on pinches and whatever you can utilize with left hand and left foot.
