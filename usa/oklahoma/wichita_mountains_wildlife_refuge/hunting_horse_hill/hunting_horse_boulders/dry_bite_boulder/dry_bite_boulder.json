Crux is pulling off the ground, after that move up and grab the sharp hold (it bites) and clear the awkward top out.Ironically this was the very first boulder we did that day and I had named it for the ultra sharp hood mid problem. Later in the afternoon when leaving the mountain I stepped on a rattlesnake that DID NOT BITE ME or even rattle at me! Shoutout to that snake for being the real MVP of the day. The irony gives this problem an extra star.","protection":"1 pad","location":"From the Mt Scott Camping Exit which is 0.25 miles west of the 6' monolith at the base of Mt Scott Road, hike north skirting the SW slope of Mount Scott's Boy. Find the converging trails and pass through a few minutes of timber to a meadow. Follow the trail running north which is on the east side of a small creek.
