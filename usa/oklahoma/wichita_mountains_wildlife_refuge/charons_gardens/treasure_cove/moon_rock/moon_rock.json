Stand south of Quarantine Daze or the meadow before Elk Slabs and Post Oak Creek. Look up to the NE and you should see Houston. If you go just north of the thick brush that makes elk slabs approach so fun you should enter a slot which runs uphill and nearly due north. Follow this up the path of least resistance and you should arrive quite near Houston and the topout of Moonrock Wall. We approached from the top after GE and had to take multiple tunnels and chimneys to get down to Houston. This may save you some time and headache.
