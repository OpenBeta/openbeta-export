Unfortunately I recently moved out of the area so I don't feel it is fair for me to withhold information on projects anymore since I don't intend on working them anytime soon. I would still hit up Ben Rosamond if you're thinking of trying this one (just for climbing ethics sake) as it takes a lot of effort to develop and clean so it is nice to at least be in the loop. We aren't going to be like \"No you can't try our proj\" but it is nice to know if someone is going out to try it. If anything I am sure Ben would want to join you and could help out in showing you around.
