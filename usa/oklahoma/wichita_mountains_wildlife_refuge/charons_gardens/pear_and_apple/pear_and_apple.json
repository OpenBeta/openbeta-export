Hop a few boulders to the west side of the field. Follow the trail south a bit, take the side trail that heads under the boulder field.

I'm sure there's an easier way to get to this climb, but this way is soooo much more fun. Follow the low angle water streak up to a bowled out area, continue up right and follow the natural moves. We did this route free-solo barefoot. The route is solid but leaves you feeling very exposed.
