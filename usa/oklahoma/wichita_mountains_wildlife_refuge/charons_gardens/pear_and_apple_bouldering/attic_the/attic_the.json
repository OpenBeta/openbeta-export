It is up the hill a little ways from the Attic Arete and faces southish. Start under the short roof in the crack that splits the back of it. Sit on top a boulder to reach start. As soon as you make the first move the ground drops out below you and as you continue moving left through the crack the ground drops further away and the landing gets even worse. at the end of the crack (where the holds get very small) you have to throw out and left over a bulge to a slopy end. by now you'll be 20 ft. up with your back to the sharp talus below as you try to press out a very difficult looking mantle. Has not been done for obvious reasons and grade is very approximate because no one has done it.","protection":"Lots and lots and lots of pads and lots and lots and lots of spotters. very very important.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"QyVQkKJGXoK+Epu05TEcFg==","name":"Attic Arete","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"Andrew Tower","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.73091,34.72315]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105986542","mp_crag_id":"105986539","climb_id":"QyVQkKJGXoK+Epu05TEcFg==","areaRef":"nl5fT2h2U6qXb/qX2Tr1zQ=="},"content":{"description":"This is a beautiful arete with a beautiful landing. faces north and sit start on the right side of the boulder traverse up and left on the arete to the top and top it out.","protection":"pads","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,9256d9a6-02c4-58f4-a2ef-6ba47aaa88af,4eec4369-9e46-54fa-96a2-2762e9daa26d,0721c70d-0861-5a9a-b8fe-9e12bad24f49,009320ac-1500-592f-b182-801ffe29331a,9e5e5f4f-6876-53aa-976f-fa97d93af5cd","pathTokens":["USA","Oklahoma","Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge","Charon's Gardens","Pear and Apple (Bouldering)","Attic, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"},{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.73091,34.72315]},"bbox":[-98.73145708911599,34.72270033981813,-98.73036291088401,34.723599660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105986539","area_id":"nl5fT2h2U6qXb/qX2Tr1zQ=="},"content":{"description":"There are only two problems up there right now and one still needs to be done.
