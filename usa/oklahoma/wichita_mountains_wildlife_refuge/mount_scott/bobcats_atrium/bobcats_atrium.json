This natural alcove is accessible from the south (0.3 miles) and north (0.2 miles) but even from a short distance this cozy room with a view may go unnoticed. Similarly two nice chimney climbs are similarly hidden in plain sight nearby.Multiple routes are available to in Bobcat's Atrium including Splitter Splatter Let's Stem At Er, an unnamed project Arete on the south side, the boulder face that comprises the NE wall, and flakey climbs on the southern exterior wall. Nearby chimneys may be tagged since they are very close to this natural room. Hike in, set up a nice rest for lunch or a nap out of noon sun, and keep an eye out for local residents - Bobcats!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:18:41.888Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:33.923Z"}
