A few ways Go, but proper sequence will save some power for the other strong lines a few steps away.Namesake: youtube.com/watch?v=UsvFzXr…;t=4s","protection":"1 pad. Lowball.","location":"Park at LMS and head down to the crag. Follow the wall to the south for 270 yds and pass a talus slope with vines. Continue and notice the rock size increasing and features showing up. Follow the animal trails to a cave overhang and a ramp that leads to Thelonious Monk in 5’ and then 10’ south of that rock you will see The Jazz Workshop founder, Charles Mingus.A more direct approach is to park at LMS and walk downhill to where the next guardrail starts. Count 7 posts and jump the rail. There should be a drainage culvert there. Scramble downhill and you should end up in the viney talus slope or just south of it. Continue south a few minutes and you will find The Jazz Workshop.On either approach if you look east to the lake you will see a cove with a sandbar extending from its northern shore. If that northern shore is south of you, you are north of Mingus. If it is north of you you are south of Mingus. If it is directly even with you and mount scott you’re right there.___To Max Roach: Walk south of Charles Mingus 20-30' and look down and right. A lowball overhang will face to the SE and a huge sharp jug should stand out quickly."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,9256d9a6-02c4-58f4-a2ef-6ba47aaa88af,4eec4369-9e46-54fa-96a2-2762e9daa26d,5de88109-c405-5645-9bf8-04ca996622b6,b6b1a5f4-36f6-59e9-b72d-bb4e3096535f,53cab618-0609-5171-886c-c8be7485529d","pathTokens":["USA","Oklahoma","Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge","Mount Scott","Jazz Workshop, The","Max Roach"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.52454,34.74593]},"bbox":[-98.52508723994536,34.74548033981815,-98.52399276005463,34.746379660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120176940","area_id":"U8q2GAYJUXGIbMi+dIVSnQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-98.52508723994536,34.74548033981815],[-98.52399276005463,34.74548033981815],[-98.52399276005463,34.746379660181866],[-98.52508723994536,34.746379660181866],[-98.52508723994536,34.74548033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"Max Roach chills just 30' south of Charles Mingus.
