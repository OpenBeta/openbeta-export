Look uphill and to the right of Zoo Wall 9-3/4 and the talus runway that separates Mount Scott’s Boy from Mount Scott. Inline with the west slope of mount scott below the saddle connecting it to Mount Scott’s Boy you should see an outcropping with obvious vertical cracks.Walk uphill on the road a few minutes until a oak forested hill above you and turn north uphill. Meander northward toward the boulder outcropping. Cracktus Minicrag is along the right eastward side of this main outcropping but there are some problems to the west and on the approach too.Basically the direction of the road from the gate pointing uphill before it turns right is a direct like toward Cracktus Minicrag but it is occluded by the hill and trees. If you stay in the clearings then approach is clear and easy.\n\n 34.739993, -98.536548"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,9256d9a6-02c4-58f4-a2ef-6ba47aaa88af,4eec4369-9e46-54fa-96a2-2762e9daa26d,5de88109-c405-5645-9bf8-04ca996622b6,600d0d86-20e6-563b-80e6-192003b894ba,8af397ba-8341-5b3d-88a0-0cd054c366b1,3d950e24-b559-564e-82bc-c0d9f683f06d","pathTokens":["USA","Oklahoma","Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge","Mount Scott","Talus Slope Boulders","Gatekeepers","Backbone Beats Wishbone Project"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.53675,34.73993]},"bbox":[-98.53729720020212,34.73948033981815,-98.53620279979789,34.740379660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120423310","area_id":"PZUOJLVZVk6CvMDZ9oPwbQ=="},"content":{"description":"BBW Project is a V6-7 open project in the Gatekeepers area just before you get to the Cracktus Minicrag. \n\n  Very hard sit start will require slappy moves on slopers and slimps to make it Go.  \n\n  Beautiful eye catching rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:18:41.896Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:50.789Z"}
