Cracktus Sit Start (V0) makes the problem more fun and committing - we couldn’t pass up the awesome jug and if really serves as a winning sit start for newer boulderers. Fun, lower grade sit starts from the dirt are hard to find and this one takes an enjoyable amount of pull and commitment to get secure. \n\n  Gym Jug Hug (V2+) starts matched in a sidepull flake with fun and awkward barn door liftoff with a true sit start with your bum on a rock shelf just off the grass. Make some big juggy moves and heel hook your way to a fun slopey mantle.  \n\n  Other problems are close by. Prospect Chimney is just uphill and to the the left on the next shelf as is Irish Mile, an adventurous VB highball that starts on underclings and finishes with crack technique 20’ up.  More exploration of nearby boulders will yield more fun volume and projects. A highball V4-5 is in the area as well as a sit start slappy and strong V6-7 on unusually featured rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:18:41.896Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:34.193Z"}
