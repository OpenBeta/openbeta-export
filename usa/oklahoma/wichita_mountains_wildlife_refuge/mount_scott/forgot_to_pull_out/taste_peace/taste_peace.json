Still, each variation is challenging and requires precision and a range of skills.One of the best Full Package problems on Mount Scott and the Refuge for that matter. Will receive shade even on summer days (sunrise to ~10 AM and ~2 PM to sunset). Midday the face is partially shaded.***MP grade is simply a placeholder so don’t get hung up on it - John and Miles will run more laps on it before making a call as well as inviting others to try it out.
