If you like barely there technical climbing give these 3 lines a go. What initially appears to be easy climbing at a distance turns into WTF when you pull on.Many folks won’t enjoy this type of thin barely there climbing but I know how some climbers get when all the moves are marginal and they love/hate it so much they will drive themselves crazy trying to send. With brushing the lichen covered edges are opening up to thin usable crimps and pad dishes.
