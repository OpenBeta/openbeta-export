Xenia faces east so it will be cool in the summer nearly all day since the trees create shade all day and the slanted roof overhead creates a slanted chimney feeling. Take larger cams (5-6-7) and some nuts to get some protection or solo to the top on blocky jugs and a bomber foot at every high-step.

Xenia is hard to photograph but it is fun to climb.***While Xenia is 5.5 if you wear a big backpack going up you will swear it's 5.12 due to the slanted roof on your back***In Greek culture, Xenia refers to Hospitality shared to travelers and a set of customs shared between Hosts & Guests.Xenia consists of two basic rules:The respect from hosts to guests. Hosts must be hospitable to guests and provide them with a bath, food, drink, gifts, and safe escort to their next destination. It is considered rude to ask guests questions, or even to ask who they are, before they have finished the meal provided to them.The respect from guests to hosts. Guests must be courteous to their hosts and not be a threat or burden. Guests are expected to provide stories and news from the outside world.

Good vibes in the alcove, good views of lake Lawtonka and Elmer Thomas and a mix of very hard lines and easier ones too.Miles found these lines in April of 2020, cleaned them of choss flakes and loose chockstones and gave an initial wake up burn to Gimme. He showed them to Alex Mitchell and John Lozano on October 7th when the first burns of Blood Pact took place and not much was accomplished except a good dose of humility. 6 months and quite a few sessions later both 5.11s got their FFAs in late 2020 - spring 2021.\n\nWe’re stoked to finally share these climbs so please go check them out!For TR anchors and rapping in, there is a convenient boulder to sling with 240-480 cm slings and a cedar tree to utilize for either end of a J-Tree style anchor using a static rope. Please do not rap down directly off this tree - a nice soft quad should be used if the tree is used at all. Anchors to Gimme Your Lunch Money and Blood Pact can be built on the boulder alone and simply re-oriented from south to east quickly. 25-35m of static line will allow a completely redundant BFK style anchor. Half of that length can be used for a simpler 2 strand anchor from the boulder alone."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:18:40.646Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:07.039Z"}
