Get up on these and use a bomber sidepull out right. Smear hard and go for the lip above without cheating the blocks on the right. Mantle or match hands here and then mantle up and work the last third of the climb to Topout. Pretty committing and fun for the grade. Feel free to input your opinion on grade or course. The necessity to smear well and go for that ledge makes it feel a little stiff but if you go for it V0-1 should be appropriate. Very fun and just the right height. ","protection":"1-2 pads","location":"34.7384053, -98.6044199"},"__v":0},{"_id":"ncBwsvQFUHG0YWoIRVPORA==","name":"Cupping A Feel","yds":"V-easy","grades":{"yds":"V-easy","font":"3","vscale":"V-easy"},"fa":"","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.60436,34.73835]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"121392959","mp_crag_id":"121392914","climb_id":"ncBwsvQFUHG0YWoIRVPORA==","areaRef":"k27XoEMtX+6cG+yiCQxnnw=="},"content":{"description":"Cupping A Feel stand starts on the left side of Backrow Baptists boulder which faces north and is just 1’minute east of Ignorance boulder.
