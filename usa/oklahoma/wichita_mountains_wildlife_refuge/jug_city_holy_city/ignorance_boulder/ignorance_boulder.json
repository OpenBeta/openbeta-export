Figure out a way to left off and control the start and gain any hold that will get you headed uphill. The line is direct but I do not want to give away too much beta so you can figure this one out.","protection":"1-2’pads","location":"34.7384582, -98.6046814"},"__v":0},{"_id":"13GhXOO2Wf6oTn5J2JkLrA==","name":"Ignorance","yds":"V0","grades":{"yds":"V0","font":"4","vscale":"V0"},"fa":"","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.60462,34.73838]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"121392817","mp_crag_id":"121392751","climb_id":"13GhXOO2Wf6oTn5J2JkLrA==","areaRef":"SBFkKJGpUqqf3LIeCb7KTg=="},"content":{"description":"On the left side of the deeper face there is a corner with and Undercling / sidepull jug.

Work around the mini diving board features up the left corner. A little more muscular and thoughtful than GJS.More Ignorance stand starts on a left hand Undercling jug and a right hand bomber sidepull and runs up the flat face to the left of GJS and Ignorance. This problem requires some Tech but lots of pulling power, so for you meatheads who like to crank, this should make you happy. I won’t spoil the beta but this is a nice one to earn.More Ignorance and the whole boulder name comes from a speech Warren Harding gave one of his terrified new partners in Yosemite. When the new guy asked something like “I’m terrified! I think I might die! How did you do this?!?” Harding thundered from above, “Ignorance!!!” and when the scared follower got to a new tough spot he yelled down “More Ignorance!!!”."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:18:40.641Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:32.772Z"}
