Pick feet and lift off into the natural Juggy line toward the crack feature and turn the roof for an exciting topout. Take a look at the fall lines and have a decent spotter. Although V4 is quite a strange compressed grade in the Wichita’s due to many factors, Hurricane Without A Name and others in the area and Paperboy Millionaire really make sense as indicative of the next step up from the best V3s in the refuge. Regardless of grade phenomena, the lines in the Hurricane Cave roof offer lots of potential for less obvious and higher grade climbs to be put up.","protection":"1-3 pads, fall from above the roof would be a wild ride","location":"(34.7377845, -98.6047589)"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,9256d9a6-02c4-58f4-a2ef-6ba47aaa88af,4eec4369-9e46-54fa-96a2-2762e9daa26d,4eb115a6-831e-593a-95ac-0b1019faa662,f7cd69b4-48ea-5c6c-bd7a-b07ebcd7dcf5","pathTokens":["USA","Oklahoma","Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge","Jug City (Holy City)","Hurricane Cave"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3+"},{"count":1,"label":"V5-6"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.60461,34.73773]},"bbox":[-98.60515718563252,34.73728033981813,-98.60406281436744,34.738179660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121411129","area_id":"981ptEjqXGy9erB+vNfc9Q=="},"content":{"description":"Hurricane Cave is just a few minutes west of Bad Beta Podcast Studios on the lower portion of the wall of climbs and features a tremendous sit start jug haul roof problem with crack features called Hurricane Without A Name, a stand start version called Standing In The Eye, and a hard and long natural line that runs through all the roof jugs and exits on the right side called Infinite Storm.A potential natural line exits the left side of the roof to a box jug that has not been worked yet - please work it and put it Up!There are likely less natural harder lines to connect under the roof."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:18:40.641Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:49.818Z"}
