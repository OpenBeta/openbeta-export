To your left shoulder should be a corner while you stand in grass. Look up and spot the natural leaning line that meanders all these unusual granite ledges. Climb smart and securely as any fall past 25' would surely result in a shook up feeling and falls from there to 40' would nearly guarantee injury. If you're not very comfortable on granite, get spooked at 15-20', or don't downclimb often, please do not risk life and limb for Walking The Fish.
