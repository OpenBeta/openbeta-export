Meander up to the first bolt, on the line of least resistance. Other solutions exist for getting to the first bolt. From here enjoy a small ledge stance. Suit up, this is where the business starts. Climb straight up the bolt line on some of the smallest holds in Oklahoma, with a mix of strength and extreme friction climbing. Once you reach the horizontal crack at the top of the wall, move right and up to build a belay in the stray cats crack. From here yell out to your second, put it in O for Onward.Notes: the second clip is potentially dangerous as missing the clip with rope out would result in a unpleasant ledge strike or deck. This route was dreamt up by Duane and was to be completed ground up, onsight. However, 40 years passed and the permission to complete the route with a rappel placed bolt to the blank middle section was given.
