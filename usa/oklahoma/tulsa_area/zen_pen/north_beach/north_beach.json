There is a solid hold way right, very balanced move. Then bump left into another set of bigger pockets, then readjust the right hand for a decent undercling. Get your feet up and go towards the top. \n\n  This is some SANDstone. Brush it really well before you climb it.  And then brush it some more. More than likely, you will slide around on a couple of the holds.","protection":"A pad or two and a spot","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,9256d9a6-02c4-58f4-a2ef-6ba47aaa88af,1dae72a2-c51d-53f0-8184-c2ea3728a31f,77d3a4a4-42d3-51b0-b832-de8483d034c8,2c7dfcdd-61c4-53d6-86cb-2a9a8044666c","pathTokens":["USA","Oklahoma","Tulsa Area","Zen Pen","North Beach"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.4023,36.13478]},"bbox":[-96.40285676364793,36.13433033981814,-96.40174323635206,36.135229660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111504407","area_id":"LH383WHEU9aGyyqagERmbA=="},"content":{"description":"These are south facing walls that are on the north side of the inlet where Purgatory is located."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:18:40.193Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:06.527Z"}
