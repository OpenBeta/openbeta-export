There are some hazards associated with climbing these boulders.  The lake bottom under the boulders are littered with large sharp rocks and stumps.  The top outs are mostly slopers as well so make sure you protect with pads well.  The routes we have tried so far are not really anything spectacular but worth a go if you are there.
