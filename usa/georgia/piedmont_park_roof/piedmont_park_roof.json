It's a 12-13 ft long multi direction roof problem with a few dynos that go out to the lip.  \n\n  I cleaned up this boulder, not much cleaning to do. The obvious roof crack goes both ways. Left to right makes a crunchy/reachy move to good jugs finshing nice crimpy holds to and easy top out. That I know I have the FA \"Bands Will Make Her Dance\" Goes between V3-5 size dependant for sure. (Any feet below the second roof are off)  \n\n  The right to left version goes the exact way out with a good move to a good sloper roof with a classic southern mantle. Based on where you top out could make this problem much harder. I finished far down and it still felt about V4. If you dyno out from the center crux on the crack could go much harder. Try it out and put something up!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:54.229Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:30.809Z"}
