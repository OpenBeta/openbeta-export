The face is about 45 to 50 feet. There is one bolted line that feels like it's around 5.9, but It's much more fun to solo. The rest of the routes are deep water solos. There's also an overhung section that looks like it has some potential, but it's not bolted, and the beginning would be a little sketchy to solo. In the summer it is very popular for cliff jumping and a rope swing, so it can get a little trashed."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:53.203Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:08.153Z"}
