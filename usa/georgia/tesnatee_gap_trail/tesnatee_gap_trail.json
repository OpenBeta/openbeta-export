The rock is clean and exposure is minimal. Some rocks chipped off but held strong for the most part. This route was set as a two hand sit start. First move was a heel hook to the ledge with the right foot and then right hand reaches up to the next hold. The boulder would be tough to top out so we set a finish hold at the top of the rock.Â ","protection":"None","location":"Start at the Tesnatee Gap to Cowrock Mountain trail head and begin the ascent. After about a quarter mile the trail will level out. At exactly the moment the trail becomes easy and flat, veer directly to your right off of the trail and up the hill side. After about 200 yards of fighting through thorns and low shrubs you will run into the boulder. Although you should be able to see it much sooner than that. The rock appears to be resting against a tree trunk, the route is just to the right of the tree."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,2d478792-07fa-599c-8787-6adbec93db9f,d0556e33-30f0-5f1f-9a8b-1b85d31d7759","pathTokens":["USA","Georgia","Tesnatee Gap Trail"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.84834,34.72632]},"bbox":[-83.84888711009481,34.725870339818144,-83.84779288990516,34.726769660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120163332","area_id":"0FVuMzDwXx+aixuF0x13WQ=="},"content":{"description":"This route is on a ridge overlooking a valley on the Tesnatee Gap Trail.
