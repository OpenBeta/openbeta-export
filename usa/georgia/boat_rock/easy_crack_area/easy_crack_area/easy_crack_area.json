Just climb the crack from a stand start (probably only V3) or from a sit start on fat hand jams. In case you are new to the technique of overhanging offwidths, the easiest way to do it is to do hang from fist-hand stacks and then jam a leg / foot / knee way up in the crack. Theres a good edge to stand on at half height and the top part is much easier. Wear long pants, long sleeves, and shoes big enough to wear socks under them and it shouldn't be much more painful then anything else at boat rock.
