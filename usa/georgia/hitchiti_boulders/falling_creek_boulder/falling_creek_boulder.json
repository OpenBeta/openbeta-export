To let others who may want to search these woods for other boulders know what's out there.  There are two boulders of climbable size on the south bank of Falling Creek just before it meets the river.  You'd have to love climbing on dirt, lichen, and moss covered rock to try it.  Maybe when the creek was down and it's been really dry...and maybe if you cleaned the you know what out of it might be worth giving a try.  Probably not when the better climbs are just down the river.  I know there is other rock out there on the Fall Line in Middle GA that's climbable it just may not be worth hunting for."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:53.207Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:29.700Z"}
