It starts in the middle of the No Good Ending traverse and goes straight up to the highest point of the boulder. \n\n  It starts off on the cracked and juggy face that turns into an almost smooth face about half way up.  The midway point is a small ledge that makes for an awkward mantle.  The crux is next with a a small vertical edge to crimp on to the right and a horizontal pincher straight up.  This one is a lot about balance and not straight power. \n\n  It's a really fun route and probable my favorite now in Hitchiti.  The top out is a little sketchy but like always the Chiti rock is super grippy and there is plenty there to get you over the top after the crux.","protection":"Two pads would be best but one will do as long as you hit it.  The fall from the crux is a pretty good one but your mainly coming straight down.  You wouldn't want to miss the pad or hit an edge and twist an ankle.  There is a tree up top that makes for a good top rope anchor if you like.  Just take the necessary precautions to protect the tree.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"nfO+JQfEUvq4nvV2Kr7EeQ==","name":"Split Decision","yds":"V3-4","grades":{"yds":"V3-4","font":"6A+","vscale":"V3-4"},"fa":"JSGreenboy","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.71953,33.02475]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"109953586","mp_crag_id":"106319513","climb_id":"nfO+JQfEUvq4nvV2Kr7EeQ==","areaRef":"Us4Ym0QxVayamyvLj6vyiQ=="},"content":{"description":"This route is just to the right of Super B.  I left it un-named because I have not been able to finish it.  I've done the bottom half but have not done the top.  I'm not to eager to try the large off width at the top by myself with only one pad.  I would name it Split Decision but if someone does climb it, name it what you will. \n\n  It starts just to the right of the broken face of Super B.  There's one large dish (flake) for a left hand and a horizontal crack for a right.  From there you have to go straight up through a blanker section and then on to the sloping edge of the main boulder.  Once you gain the ledge you have to transition to the off width splitter above and top out. \n\n  The transition is the tough part but I know it will go.  I can see the holds and it's a solid edge.  It's just a long way to fall if you are by yourself.
