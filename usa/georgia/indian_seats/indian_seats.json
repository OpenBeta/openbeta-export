Despite being probably the shortest route in the area, is decidedly the most challenging I've tried.  By far the most difficult part is dealing with the coarseness/sharpness of the rock in this feature. Your next challenge is actually finding the holds, as given the course grain here the small protrusions you need to pull yourself up will blend in with the face.  If you can get over the pain, a couple of interesting bouldering moves will put you at the top.","protection":"Fixed anchors","location":"Top section of the wall, immediately left of a right-leaning finger crack, and left of a small, short hand-crack and an obvious 2-foot deep ledge.
