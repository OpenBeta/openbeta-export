Start left hand on the obvious half-pad undercling and right hand on a slopey undercling pinch. The boulder gets a lot of runoff in heavy rains so you might have to dig some leaves out to find the feet but the right foot is a pretty good pocket-dish and paste the left foot under the left hand. Core up and start slapping. For an idea of where to start as it is a little confusing Taylor McNeil has a good beta vid from back in the day. Classic compression awaits those burly enough to fight for it. A finicky to place high right heel hook leads you into the stand start but its not over until you grab the jugs on top. Usually takes a full day for the landing to dry out after it rains as there is a creek bed right under the boulder.","protection":"","location":"down hill on an obvious trail from Golden Harvest"},"__v":0},{"_id":"hhqFx8bdXMS7rBwtm1rodw==","name":"Iron Claw","yds":"V7","grades":{"yds":"V7","font":"7A+","vscale":"V7"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.38989,34.6591]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"107322015","mp_crag_id":"120482540","climb_id":"hhqFx8bdXMS7rBwtm1rodw==","areaRef":"ut6Yj54zXLme9Q96xXOToQ=="},"content":{"description":"An impressive line up a steep prow.
