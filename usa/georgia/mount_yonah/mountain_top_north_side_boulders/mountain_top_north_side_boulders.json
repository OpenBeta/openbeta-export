This small area has a number of problems with lots of variety. some of the problems can seep in times of defrost or periods of heavy rain. It's a hefty hike with 1100 feet elevation gain to get to these boulders. There is some more potential bouldering further down along the cliffline of the headwall. There's another nice headwall feature with good potential for bouldering about 200 yards northeast of the army camp downhill. There's a little more stuff further downhill."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:55.189Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:32.727Z"}
