If I have it wrong please let me know.**\n\n  I believe this area is also called Middle Kingdom in the the Dixie Cragger's Atlas.  I thought I'd go ahead and post the area and maybe some folks can start adding routes.  It's an interesting area just above the Lowers and White Wall.  Maybe half way up to the Main Wall.  The Hobbits Perch is the largest feature in the area with several aid routes and a few 5.8/5.9s.  The aid routes are mainly in the cave area at the bottom. \n\n  There is a lot of rock in this area.  I'm sure there are more routes to be discovered in here.  Alot of them would be pretty hard or aid routes.  There are some smooth faces when you get into some of the slots between rocks.  There's also the possibility of a handful of boulder routes here as well.  We've noted some as we've passed thru on the way to the main wall.  It's an area worth checking out if you are done with the Main Wall and the Lowers."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:55.190Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:11.496Z"}
