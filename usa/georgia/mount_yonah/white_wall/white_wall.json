The bolts are a bit older (but still in good shape) so I'm guessing it's been there a while.  I haven't found any information about this route or what it was named.  It's not listed in the Dixie Cragger's Atlas.  On Michael Crowder's topo of White Wall it's just a blank #5 with no info.  I rated it 5.11a for now.  We didn't finish it clean and had to move back over on to Return of the Jodi at the top because it was too wet.  To me it seems harder than the 5.10s on White Wall.  If anyone has any info about the route please share. \n\n  It basically starts in between Dancing Girls and Jodi under the first bolt.  The first few moves are a scramble then the holds get scarce and pretty thin.  There aren't too many options as it is pretty smooth near the bolts and in between this route and Jodi it's pretty smooth.  The holds here are thinner than on Jodi or Think Pink.  It basically goes straight up with the bolts to your left. \n\n  As you get closer to the slanting vertical crack that is to the left of Jodi we had to bail to the right back on to Return of the Jodi.  It was still wet and there was no grip at all on the tiny ledges.  According to Crowder's topo the route goes straight up keeping the crack just to your right.  We could see the sequence of moves but it was too wet to do it. \n\n  Whatever it's name is it's not as straight forward or classic as Jodi but the moves are thinner and tougher.  They are a bit reachy and in a few places you have to almost mantle the small holds to reach the next set.  It's a tough route for sure and pretty fun. ","protection":"It's bolted and it would be a pretty tough lead.  You might need a few pieces of pro at the top.  You could set up a top rope on top with some webbing but you can also use the anchor on top of Return of the Jodi.  It's a bit of an angle and you'll end up swinging back under Jodi when you fall but it's manageable and not dangerous.  The rope doesn't touch rock at all so the swing is not going to wear on your rope.","location":"In between Dancing Girls and Return of the Jodi at almost the lowest point of White Wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"G4I2BH55Xf+G7FnUHVFSwA==","name":"Slick as Glass","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Curtis and Stan Glass","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.71671,34.63604]},"left_right_index":8,"mp_id":"118115368","mp_crag_id":"106109942","climb_id":"G4I2BH55Xf+G7FnUHVFSwA==","areaRef":"SDhwizG0UOir3nveH1wxEw=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the thin finger tips crack to the left of Lizards Tail","protection":"Whatever micro gear will fit in the crack","location":"Right side of White wall"},"__v":0},{"_id":"+K0EKLm5UcSQODVm4zGN8A==","name":"Route Patrol","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.71671,34.63604]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"118115342","mp_crag_id":"106109942","climb_id":"+K0EKLm5UcSQODVm4zGN8A==","areaRef":"SDhwizG0UOir3nveH1wxEw=="},"content":{"description":"Head up the rounded part of the wall past two bolts to a tree anchor","protection":"2 bolts + tree anchor","location":"Left side of White Wall"},"__v":0},{"_id":"vNbIFfPjV5qUorlc1SaVoA==","name":"Return of The Jodi","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Jody Jacobs","type":{"sport":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.71671,34.63604]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"106109970","mp_crag_id":"106109942","climb_id":"vNbIFfPjV5qUorlc1SaVoA==","areaRef":"SDhwizG0UOir3nveH1wxEw=="},"content":{"description":"Good route that has a little more \"style\" than some of its neighbors.
