From the short approach trail you will first come to a few small overhanging boulder problems in the V0-V2 range.  Then you will notice a bolted overhang that is supposedly 5.10-5.11.  Keep walking and you will find a few other boulder problems and then a large boulder/formation with a bolt on top.  From this bolt you can top rope two separate problems on this formation.  The one on the right is much easier than the left.
