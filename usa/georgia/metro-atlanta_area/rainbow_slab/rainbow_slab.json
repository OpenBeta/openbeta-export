It's right next to the Spectrum apartment building, and that combined with Midtown's vibrant LGBTQ+ community lead to my choice of name. It's currently mostly undeveloped, but as no one has uploaded anything from this spot on MP I figured I might as well. Please add climbs and help clean the area. I'm not currently sure who owns this, but as it's accessible from the sidewalk it should hopefully be public land. Fairly chossy. Bring a wire brush for loose granite."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:54.870Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:04.104Z"}
