Two stout trees to top rope from, bring two long pieces of webbing (30 to 35'), padding for two trees and I padded the lip for the slings due to sharp edges. WARNING!!! if you fall on the easy 5th class you can ground fall. Once you engage the crack you are fine but be aware. Have you belayer anchored down for TR.(Also, if you think you are going to fall before the crack, don't bother going on.)","location":"Dead center of the boulder/cliff, look up.

The Zipper was long known as a good place to practice aid climbing, and aid climbing is were it received it's name. The story is someone was aiding the Zipper on all passive gear when a piece popped and started a zipper effect dumping the leader in the dirt. Many free climbers over the years have taken a stab at the Zipper including Chris Watford, Jeff Scully, Phil Fisher, and Robyn Erbesfield who made it to the lip. It didn't see a complete free ascent until 1985 by Rob Robinson.   There is also a traverse and some drop off boulder problems on the left and right of the formation."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:54.870Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:31.393Z"}
