A couple of jambs (why we chose this, it was a little damp ). Now, my deep thoughts: I'm fairly familiar with climbing on the East-face of Currahee thanks a lot to the locals, but trying to find boulders by the descriptions on Mountain Project is impossible--so I just found one, cleaned the dead wood off, and climbed it. Saying it's left of the Main Face doesn't help me because I can't find the Main Face. Use words like north and west. I do like this mountain though.Â  The crux is in transition from the north wall to the west--the start.","protection":"Crash pad or two and a spotter.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"lU5DWBnWWiud2XhFch/dPg==","name":"Baculum","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.37694,34.52852]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"112456469","mp_crag_id":"111710617","climb_id":"lU5DWBnWWiud2XhFch/dPg==","areaRef":"vFZLPIhFVNy7LO+cjFor/Q=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the right side of the boulder in some good pockets.
