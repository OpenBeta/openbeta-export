Other pioneers include Jim Corbett, David Young and Stewart Coffield.  The more recent development (which continues today) has been in the Netherworld, the section furthest south at the crag. \n\n  Lost Wall is a predominantly trad area, with single-pitch lines ranging from 40-120 feet high.  The rock is sandstone and though not as consistent as T-Wall, is mostly good quality. \n\n  Camping is available in the wildlife management area, though the camping regulations have changed in the last year or so.
