There's a ton of work to be done around the boulders here, as well as a ton of chossy, rotting rock. The problems here are either super slabby or crack-climbs, from finger-sized to off-width-shove-your-body-in-there-stuff.  The rock is cheese-grater granite. \n\n  There are tons and tons of tiny boulders that are rotted to hell so be careful! A friend of mine pulled on a giant flake that popped off almost immediately and nearly crushed his foot. Also, don't get discouraged if you're only finding hip-height stuff; the taller boulders are further in and spread apart from one another. The area is pretty clean, just not well-traveled (except during hunting season). Definitely worth noting that climbers should be watchful during hunting season because it coincides pretty closely with climbing season. It could do with some trail maintenance and potentially a sign of two."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:00:54.229Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:30.838Z"}
