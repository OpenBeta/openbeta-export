The approach takes between 2 and 3 hours.  This spire can be seen from the main highway as the black spire way up on the hillside to the south, as you head east just past the Indian Cove Entrance Rd.  The route climbs up cracks and flakes on the south side of the spire.","protection":"Mostly medium to large cams. When we climbed this spire, we saw evidence that someone had attemped to drill an anchor on the summit, but had never finished the job.  We placed two bolts on the summit, so you could safely get off the spire. I believe that Kevin Daniels and Tony Sartin may also have climbed this spire from the Queen Mountain side, but other than that, I have no information on this spire or any ascents of this spire.","location":"The route is on the south side of the spire.
