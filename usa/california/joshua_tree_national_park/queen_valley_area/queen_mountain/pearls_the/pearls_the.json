Pearl Necklace is a route for those that like technical moves on dime edges.  It has multiple cruxes with good rests in between.  The crimping starts right off the high ledge.  Difficult climbing leads to a large edge and a puzzling series of moves between it and the next big hold.  From there an arching crack leads to a tough series of moves to big holds below the anchor.","protection":"6 bolts, green to red alien and similar nuts, 2 anchor bolts with slings and fixed biners.

From a high ledge it arcs left to a thin crack, then back right to the anchor.\n\nThe upper face is above a bulge of somewhat poor rock (once on the ledge, the first bolt can be clipped).

Our experience:\n\n- The most straight forward access to the starting ledge is via a small buttress right of the first bolt on\n\nPearl Drops\n\n.  A 5.0 scramble leads to a #1 Camalot placement with an easy step across to the top of the ledge (recommended).\n\n- Climb the cleaner crack that starts a body length up the center of the lower face.  We didn't try, so no gear recommendation.\n\n- Climb the dirty crack on the left side, with very loose holds (not recommended).\n\nOne warning is the second bolt is very difficult to clip from the obvious line.  A fall from here would land on the ledge below.
