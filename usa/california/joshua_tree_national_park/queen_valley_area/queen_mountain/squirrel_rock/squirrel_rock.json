The route more-or-less follows the blunt southern arÃªte of the formation.\n\nThis long and varied pitch starts with a finger crack followed by a short face crux past a bolt. A right-facing corner is then gained, eventually stepping out right onto airy and exposed face past 3 more bolts on the final headwall. There is some loose stuff on the upper half, probably due to lack of traffic. Adequately protected and a worthy tick. Easily 3/4 stars.","protection":"4 bolts, gear from fingers to 2\".
