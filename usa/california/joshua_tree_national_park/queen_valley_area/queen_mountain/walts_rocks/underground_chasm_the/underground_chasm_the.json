Down low some suspect patina affords great positive edges and some potentially reachy moves up slightly overhanging rock. There is a good rest midway, and then it's game on again through the upper half of the route which climbs perfect rock to a easy slab finish to the anchors.\n\nSadly this route is impinged upon by it's neighbor to the left, but it shouldn't detract too much from the excellent climbing.","protection":"9 bolts (reasonably protected but feels somewhat sporty) plus a bolted anchor. Use extreme care clipping the first three bolts - blowing a clip at any of these would result in a ground fall.","location":"Upon entering the Chasm, this route is on the main level (once above the steep ramp) on the left. It has a high first bolt that is accessed by bouldering a couple moves up a left-leaning rail feature."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,5d770058-79bd-50e4-9768-b5a68673bac0,929fc444-9b51-5851-a376-381c0cd4ec01,4e268bfa-1908-5078-88c9-5d6aa2fae3d3,d71df7a4-3540-5583-83ef-4d19d1059cbb","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Queen Valley Area","Queen Mountain","Walt's Rocks","Underground Chasm, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.1048,34.06016]},"bbox":[-116.10534277288778,34.059710339818146,-116.10425722711224,34.06060966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108482602","area_id":"1x33pDVAVYOD700Z0QWcuw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.10534277288778,34.059710339818146],[-116.10425722711224,34.059710339818146],[-116.10425722711224,34.06060966018187],[-116.10534277288778,34.06060966018187],[-116.10534277288778,34.059710339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:09.439Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:58.803Z"}
