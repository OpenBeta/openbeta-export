Unlike most JTree top outs, there are real holds! The stand start is V1 or easy V2 for the mantle. The sit start is probably a little harder.\n\nThe first known ascent of this route occurred just after Li and Stéphane's wedding, which took place atop Darwin Dome after a group ascent of Lust in the Love Den.","protection":"There's a flat, relatively sandy landing, but there are a couple of sharks that might twist your ankle.","location":"Looking at Darwin Dome from the north, locate Lust in the Love Den—it's the left trending crack in the big slab with a bush growing out of the bottom. Now walk left (east) down a wash for ~50 yards. You'll see a big boulder with a large crack splitting the face you can see. Walk around its left side to the problem."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,5d770058-79bd-50e4-9768-b5a68673bac0,f3827de4-3d77-5165-9313-660571c4aec7,4ada5d07-3632-50c6-a747-2ea1b4277ce6,6b22284e-0b05-59dc-9a6a-9a74daa85889,632ddccb-e410-57c7-ab6d-e850f319e8eb","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Queen Valley Area","Geology Tour Road","Galapagos, The","Darwin Dome","Darwin Dome Bouldering"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2-"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.12034,33.94979]},"bbox":[-116.12088206797826,33.94934033981813,-116.11979793202174,33.95023966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120814406","area_id":"Yy3cy+QQV8erbehQ8xno6w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.12088206797826,33.94934033981813],[-116.11979793202174,33.94934033981813],[-116.11979793202174,33.95023966018186],[-116.12088206797826,33.95023966018186],[-116.12088206797826,33.94934033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:11.020Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:28.222Z"}
