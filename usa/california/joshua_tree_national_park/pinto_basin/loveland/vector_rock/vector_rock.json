Initially the climbing is easy in the hand sized crack but quickly becomes more demanding as the crack narrows to finger width. The sustained crux section is protected by #00 - #1 TCU's or small stoppers / brass. Technical footwork on thin edges and stamina is necessary to place gear. A committing mantle move (5.10-) out of the seam to the top adds excitement to this J-Tree classic! The descent is a walk off to the east down a gully system with several ledges.","protection":"This beautiful crack / face climb requires many cams to 2.5\"  - especially 1/2\" to 1\".
