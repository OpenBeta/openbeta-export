ClipÂ a bolt and make the crux reach/mantle onto a small ledge at the base of a right-facing corner. Climb the corner above getting gear where you can and continue to the top and anchors.\n\nThere really isn't any pro after the corner so falling exiting the corner is not a good idea.\n\nWith better routes nearby and the generally scrappy nature of the route it's hard to recommend this route. Half a star out of five.\n\nNamed for the infamous New York crime boss John Gotti (aka the Dapper Don).","protection":"1 bolt, tiny cams to 0.5 inch, bolted anchor/rap\n\nThe fixed pin in the corner is gone as of December 2019","location":"Located just right of\n\nHow Deep is Ben's Love\n\non the Teflon Boulder (aka: Boulder 7), a huge brown boulder that forms the eastern edge of the boulder field."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,fc952fb1-cb91-5f1c-8512-ff5f0529534b,61b35516-76ec-5883-91de-b3963d651826,987c44a6-a1cd-57aa-9a86-5b0d7a825398,0346eac8-7268-5e38-9118-b072462dbbd7","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Pinto Basin","Loveland","Bond Boulders, The","Teflon Don Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.05293,34.02089]},"bbox":[-116.05347252163796,34.02044033981814,-116.05238747836206,34.021339660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118174298","area_id":"A0bqyHJoXjiRGLByRi271w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.05347252163796,34.02044033981814],[-116.05238747836206,34.02044033981814],[-116.05238747836206,34.021339660181866],[-116.05347252163796,34.021339660181866],[-116.05347252163796,34.02044033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:06.014Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:22.528Z"}
