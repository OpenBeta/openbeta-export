After a stupidly runout start the next bolt is close enough to aid off and the topout is just as well protected. Once on top take your chances rapping off the solitary bolt or simul-rap - better yet avoid this dud and keep walking.\n\nThe first ascent is unknown as whoever put this route up is proabably too ashamed to admit it (the first bolt hanger does look like an old Houser hanger minus the stamped initials).\n\nNot even worth replacing the bolts, somebody should do a service to the community and erase this route. Minus two stars out of five.","protection":"2 bolts, 1 bolt anchor (all bolts are 1/4\")","location":"This worthless route sits on west face of the large tan boulder facing the Live And Let Die Boulder.
