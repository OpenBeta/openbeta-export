Quick draws only.  Someone left carabiners on the bolts, so you can rap if you wish, or walk off.  I would be nice to have some stainless steel quick links or rap rings on the bolts instead of someone's ghetto biners left behind to steal.","location":"From the alternate approach wash to Loveland and Beak Boulders, hike past the old mining homestead area and the small crag with Tidbit, which is up and to the left.    Just before you get to the section you have to scramble and boulder in the wash to continue, you take a wash or weakness to the left (west).   This narrow canyon soon opens up and there are some old deserted mines or mine diggings up and to the right.  The crag is now visible ahead and on the left.  Approach from car is probably about 25 minutes of mostly flat and pleasant hiking."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,fc952fb1-cb91-5f1c-8512-ff5f0529534b,61b35516-76ec-5883-91de-b3963d651826,fadef93b-b57a-51f5-8590-231388716ceb","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Pinto Basin","Loveland","Alternate Approach crags"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.04359,34.01796]},"bbox":[-116.04413250291132,34.017510339818145,-116.04304749708868,34.01840966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107102475","area_id":"+t75O7V6UfWFkCMTiHFs6w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.04413250291132,34.017510339818145],[-116.04304749708868,34.017510339818145],[-116.04304749708868,34.01840966018186],[-116.04413250291132,34.01840966018186],[-116.04413250291132,34.017510339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:07.354Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:56.674Z"}
