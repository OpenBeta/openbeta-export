It starts in a corner and arks left, becoming almost horizontal at the top.\n\nThe overhanging nature of the route is not immediately obvious.  Neither is the nature of the \"flake\" until you boulder up crappy rock to peer up from underneath. The flake is more like a large tomb lid, which sticks out from the crack, rather than flat on the face.  Make the decision on whether you are going to hang on the flake at the base, because it ain't called \"Airwalk\" for nothing.\n\nThin moves at the base with slightly grain rock lead to a finger crack system.  An odd move leads to grabbing/jamming the start of the flake.  This move gives you little opportunity to perform the usual tests for looseness, as it is slightly dynamic.  From there the wall drops away, leaving you fully suspended on the lid.  Gear is available all along the flake, but you have to wonder if it's better to fall and swing, or fall and potentially take the whole thing with you.  Once on the flake, you can continue to a section that is not a part of the flake itself.  The going remains physical until you mantel onto the top.","protection":"Average rack, hand size for anchor.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Upy1zhaHWDOpv3LBdTkxgA==","name":"Robocop meets The Munchkins","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Geoff Archer, Dave Stoner, Jeff Kasten, Bill Freeman, Feb. 1988","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.04802,34.03083]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105724135","mp_crag_id":"105721337","climb_id":"Upy1zhaHWDOpv3LBdTkxgA==","areaRef":"4HA/AGDfU76kp3xJ6ZG8Hg=="},"content":{"description":"This route is the very definition of sporty.
