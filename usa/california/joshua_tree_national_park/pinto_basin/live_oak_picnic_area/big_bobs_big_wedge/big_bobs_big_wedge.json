The last moves can be committing.\n\nThis should be on every wide-crack climber's tick list for Joshua Tree.  The 5.11 rating is what's given in the Vogel guide, while the V5 is what's given in the bouldering guide (That guy also only gave it three out of five stars.  Guess he doesn't do much crack bouldering).  Personally I would lean toward the V5 end of things, which would approximately translate to a YDS grade of 5.12.
