You start the climb going up a crack to the right or a chimney to the left and get to the top of a 15 foot block.  The crux is going up the inside face and making your way past two bolts out to the arete.  Going up the arete is exciting and airy and worth it.  You'll pass a few bolts along the way to get to within 15 feet of the summit.  After the last bolt you have about 10 feet to go to the rap rings, belay from the top.","protection":"4-5 bolts, rap rings at top.
