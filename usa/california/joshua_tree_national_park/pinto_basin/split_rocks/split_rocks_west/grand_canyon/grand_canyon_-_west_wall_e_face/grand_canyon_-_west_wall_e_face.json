The crack is very exciting and varied. The first bolt is solid, and the first few nut placements are excellent as well and easy to place. Technical crux is just at the start of the thin crack, but there is a possibility of failure near the top of the block due to the pump from jamming the flaring crack at the top. When I climbed this route, there was no anchor at the top, just a single bolt stud sticking out of the rock with no hanger.","protection":"Mostly nuts, a #4 metolius was useful up high, down low, one bolt to clip before you reach first nut placement","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"1v4Rv8dkU3G6U6zH2uuzwg==","name":"Stitch in Time","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Alan Bartlett, Steve Parker, and George Burton, February 1993","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.05677,34.00707]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"105857833","mp_crag_id":"106621091","climb_id":"1v4Rv8dkU3G6U6zH2uuzwg==","areaRef":"RyHwB588V0WBqpokKMAijA=="},"content":{"description":"Liebacking and steep face moves up a thin crack lead to a wild face crux near the top by a bolt; an excellent route.
