(Why this bolt was placed here is a mystery as the route does not go up past it). Up face to a horizontal (place medium gear here), then up and left to another bolt. (This bolt is also in a contrived spot). Move back right then up and then back left (10c) to easier ground. Up and left is a final bolt which is passed on the left (10a/b).\n\nNo real cracks are found at the top of the route, gear is found well to the right (as facing cliff). Walk off to the right.
