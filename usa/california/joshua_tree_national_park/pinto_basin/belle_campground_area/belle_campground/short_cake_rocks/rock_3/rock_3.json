It felt 5.7ish.\n\nThe climb is on the back side of \"rock 3,\" pretty much opposite of Ashes, and starts behind a boulder, left of a water trough, and climbs some flakes.  The first bolt is about 15' up, if you fall, a huge cats claw bush at the base of the climb will make sure you enjoy the way down.\n\nIt climbs past 3 or 4 bolts on some broken flakes, but the bolts did seem solid.  It tops out to two bolts for an anchor (no rap) and the walk off is to the climbers left.  Enjoyable and worth the walk around for another tick.","protection":"3-4 bolts, anchor at top.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"8bXverxoXEiIvhmNr/x29Q==","name":"Blue Sky Mine","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Mark Spencer, March 1990","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.01854,33.99939]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106934616","mp_crag_id":"105924769","climb_id":"8bXverxoXEiIvhmNr/x29Q==","areaRef":"cOUA4v+SWZSD/t0xX+5e0g=="},"content":{"description":"Start up ?? and when possible traverse up and left staying independent of that route.","protection":"TR","location":"Just left of ??."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,fc952fb1-cb91-5f1c-8512-ff5f0529534b,bf39f812-1343-519a-bbbe-a05323f97dd1,a8d554d4-17bd-5a0f-903e-6e95ef0cff49,020f26f7-1c7f-58a6-a6e5-04f10d561484,70e500e2-ff92-5994-83fe-dd315fee5ed2","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Pinto Basin","Belle Campground Area","Belle Campground","Short Cake Rocks","Rock 3"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.01854,33.99939]},"bbox":[-116.01908238428716,33.998940339818134,-116.01799761571282,33.99983966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105924769","area_id":"cOUA4v+SWZSD/t0xX+5e0g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.01908238428716,33.998940339818134],[-116.01799761571282,33.998940339818134],[-116.01799761571282,33.99983966018186],[-116.01908238428716,33.99983966018186],[-116.01908238428716,33.998940339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:59.118Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:47.849Z"}
