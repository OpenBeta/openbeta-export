To protect the initial (sketchy) traverse a 3-4\" cam can be used on a very long (6') runner.\n\nWatch out for the follower when placing protection on the finger crack, a piece at the top prevents a dangerous swing if they fall pulling the last few moves.","location":"Rappel from the webbing anchor at the top of the chimney down and to the climber's right of the summit.
