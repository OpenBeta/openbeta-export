Master and Servant.\n\nThis is an .11d handcrack!

Reach the top on shallow flaring jams stepping right through three vertical slashes.\n\nThis could be an amazing climb but for the abysmal rock quality.  The large sharp razor grains are bad enough... and then they move.  The grit is showering off the inside of the crack as you jam on it.  Jamming on the moving razors is a big threat to your skin.  Heavy taping advised lest you risk having to take double digit rest days for skin regeneration.\n\nIt's a shame, this could clean into a huge classic, but I fear the rock is just too lousy and it will always be unpleasant.","protection":"Tape and a toprope.  (two bolts on top)\n\nIt's possible to lead this route with 2-4\" cams, but it's an easy toprope and the rock quality is a big deterrent to the lead.

The top rounds off and falls will give your rope a big grind over very rough rock.","location":"Sandworm Rock, center.
