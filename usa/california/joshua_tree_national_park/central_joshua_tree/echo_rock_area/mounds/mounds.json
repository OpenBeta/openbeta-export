Once in the wide crack above (4\" pro is helpful) a few offwidth moves give way to easier climbing as the angle kicks back on the way to the top.\n\nShort and engaging, this is one of a handful of routes at Joshua Tree that offers totally unique movement not typically found on other climbs of the area.
