The routes at Rusty Wall are fairly unusual by J-Tree standards:  steep straight-in jamming more reminiscent of the Utah Desert that your typical quartz monzonite crag.  You have O'Kelleys on the right side which tackles a desperate boulder problem to beautiful hands.  To the left is O'Kelley's shorter but more demanding brother, Wangerbanger.  Wangerbanger is fairly straight-forward by 5.11 J-Tree standards... no dicking with funky RPs, just plugging cams and climbing.  As a result many people generally consider this fairly soft for 11c, though the percentage of leaders that end up dangling at the crux, just below the pod, is probably just as high as any other similarly graded climb.\n\nSo, anyway: The climb is short, but pithy.  The crack begins as wide hands but thins to ring-locks just below the pod.  Crank into the pod and cop a decent rest.  The crux will be somewhere just below the pod depending on your hand size, though getting into the pod is also burly as hell.  Continue upward through the pod system (harder than it looks!) to a funky mantle at the top.","protection":"2 sets of cams from blue TCU to #3 camalot.
