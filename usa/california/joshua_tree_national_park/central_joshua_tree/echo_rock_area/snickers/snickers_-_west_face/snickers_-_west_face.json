The climb traverses out under a huge dark black cave/roof, using natural gear, and a bolt and fixed pin too. Turn the big roof on a couple of bolts, then clip a few fixed pins and fixed copperheads, then follow a crack up and right to a few free moves to a dike to finish the route off.  Most of the tricky placements are fixed, and the crux on the first ascent was hand drilling a few aid bolts hanging upside down out the big roof! Watch for rope drag.  Joshua Tree has many excellent \"practice\" aid climbs;  this is one of them.  Walk off to the right.","protection":"No need to bring any pins, heads or such;...just cams and stoppers and quick draws.
