The bolts sprayed into this wall are semi confusing, and I found the second bolt real hard to clip.  If you move slightly to the left into a broken corner, the moves are easier on worse rock.  At the top, you can move left to a slightly easier top out, or move right to a very easy top out, or go straight up for a contrived and harder top out.  The climbing is good, but contrived, and the moves can be interesting if you pick and use the nice jugs.","protection":"3 bolts, anchors (all 3/8\").
