It starts at a large flake just left of a boulder.\n\nThere is an alternate start for this route just left of this flake, but the old quarter inch bolt was rusted and hangerless as of late October, 2002.

You'll find yourself in an open, airy cave system.  Walk left until you leave the cave, then climb (low fifth class) onto the very top when it becomes convenient.  Keep walking left, scramble down a couple more fourth-to-low-fifth class downclimb sections, and walk off onto the road.\n\nThough you could reach the top of this climb via the walkoff, the traversing nature would make it a poor toprope.","protection":"Standard rack, plus something big (#4 Camalot) for flake at bottom.
