The first 10 feet has some brittle holds, but clears up quickly. A full 30m in height, there is no rappel off (don't use the tree) and you must climb down the backside and bushwhack your way out of the bouldery & vegetated canyon. While in this canyon, it's worth doing The Quest for the Golden Hubris and the wide cracks to either side (this too is a short hike off) Despite all of this, the route is hands down one of the great 5.7 hand cracks in the park (better than Double Cross and Mental Physics with absolutely no crowd).","protection":"Gear to #6 is useful to protect the awkward finish (wide technique not necessary)","location":"See photo to find the right crack.  Across from Room to Shroom rappel, It's one of the twin cracks (right) that are found to the left of the tall slab with 2 horizontal breaks in it."},"__v":0},{"_id":"UQeCUAAlVWaEQ99QriyJag==","name":"After-shroom Delight","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14729,34.03426]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"116696866","mp_crag_id":"114249953","climb_id":"UQeCUAAlVWaEQ99QriyJag==","areaRef":"/t/UWrnYX6mGCEf05MLYiw=="},"content":{"description":"A narrow dihedral with a hand crack inside.  Short, chill, and full of variety.  Crux is at the middle and can be easily protected with a small cam or mid-sized nut.  Rappel off the sling crammed into a large flake.","protection":"Nuts.
