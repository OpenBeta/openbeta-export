It is a stunning line, the most impressive on the whole east face of this rock. Start by bouldering up directly under the bolt, some long reaches required through the grainy rock here. After clipping the bolt, do a very tricky mantle (feels like V4) and then move left to sloping ledge. Once you get into the overhanging corner, place some gear and try stemming your way to the top. Mantling out is easy. The crux is starting the stemming, may be easier with tiny fingers, Mike said the grade was just an estimate, they really did not have a good idea of it. This climb is rarely done, and it is much harder than the grade would suggest. Easily toproped now from the bolt anchor.","protection":"One bolt (3/8\" stainless), then small TCU's from #1 to #4, two bolt anchor (3/8\" stainless) on top.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"tU0oDiHFWhmLiiJNP8umOw==","name":"Rain Dance","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"John Bachar and Mike Lechlinski, 1980","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14995,34.03159]},"left_right_index":6,"mp_id":"121782793","mp_crag_id":"105720972","climb_id":"tU0oDiHFWhmLiiJNP8umOw==","areaRef":"efPU7NT9WAKjowoL8NqZOg=="},"content":{"description":"Climb a tricky thin crack which splits the face, and when it ends climb unprotected face up to and over a roof to finish past a horizontal crack.","protection":"Gear to 2.5 inches, but mainly thin","location":"Starts about 25 feet right of\n\nFlaming Arrow\n\n."},"__v":0},{"_id":"TVJkwFQwUJKr8BHkzcCiSA==","name":"Prairie Schooner","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Todd Swain, October 1989","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14995,34.03159]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"121782729","mp_crag_id":"105720972","climb_id":"TVJkwFQwUJKr8BHkzcCiSA==","areaRef":"efPU7NT9WAKjowoL8NqZOg=="},"content":{"description":"Face climb into a less than vertical right facing dihedral, and when it ends continue up grainy face past several horizontal slashes.","protection":"Gear to 3 inches","location":"Starts about 10 feet right of [["},"__v":0},{"_id":"CJHkAMZBVeelq9su0qdGnw==","name":"Kickoff","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Alan Roberts, 1980","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14995,34.03159]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"105834984","mp_crag_id":"105720972","climb_id":"CJHkAMZBVeelq9su0qdGnw==","areaRef":"efPU7NT9WAKjowoL8NqZOg=="},"content":{"description":"A mediocre crack route in a left-facing corner.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":"East face of Rockwork Rock, to the right of Rockwork Orange."},"__v":0},{"_id":"1PstKmnnU6aEKGzAZ8ytnA==","name":"Keys Ranch Road","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14995,34.03159]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"116717654","mp_crag_id":"105720972","climb_id":"1PstKmnnU6aEKGzAZ8ytnA==","areaRef":"efPU7NT9WAKjowoL8NqZOg=="},"content":{"description":"Came across this climb in Todd G's sport guide. Interesting route and worth doing, especially on a busy day as I don't think many people wander back here.\n\nThe first pitch has a fifth class move passing the first bolt and then an easy traverse on a ledge passing some bolts and pins.  There is a bolted belay just past the ledge.  The first pitch appears to just get you where the climbing starts.\n\nThe second pitch contains some adventurous and interesting climbing (though quite grainy in areas).  Traverse out on a good 3\"-4\" ledge with bolts every 15 or so feet.  After passing about five bolts the ledge begins to disappear and you make your way up and right onto the slabby face passing 3 more bolts until you reach the anchor, a variety of paths exist.\n\nAs mentioned in the guide book, after the the 6th bolt you'll need to start to head up to the anchor.
