This is a great climb. It's popular, and there's often a line, but it's still well worth doing. As soon as you hit the corner past the second bolt, it's like there's no one else around but you and a hundred feet of air. The crux is negotiating your way over a small bulge above the second bolt -- the holds are there and bomber, though, so fire away!! This is one climb that I intend to come back and do again, many times.For excellent photo ops, set a friend up with a camera on the sloping rock that faces the south face.","protection":"4 bolts, bolted anchor/rap (all 3/8\")","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"yWbNrfX7ULqyy2kMfLOcJw==","name":"South Face Center","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.15237,33.98437]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105724294","mp_crag_id":"105720861","climb_id":"yWbNrfX7ULqyy2kMfLOcJw==","areaRef":"/BvFxi7AWEayqp/5jDUpdw=="},"content":{"description":"This route climbs the south face of Headstone Rock between Cryptic and the Southwest Corner.
