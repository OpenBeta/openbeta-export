This is an excellent and beautiful aid route and is great practice with RURPs/copperheads without seriously risking one's neck, because there are a few \"chicken\" bolts along the thin crack to safeguard against any super long falls. The route starts as an easy slab/apron (5.5, 1 bolt), then hits a head wall. A thin seam/crack runs the length of the head wall, but doesn't quite reach the slab. Aid off a second bolt, and ascend the thin crack on RURPs, beaks, and/or copperheads. This crack is supplemented with 3 \"chicken\" bolts, so you probably won't wet your pants on this section. Please leave the chicken bolts in place.\n\nAfter awhile, the crack opens up to take RPs, TCUs, and stoppers. Rappel off one bolt and a runner around a horn (single 60 mm. rope, 100').","protection":"Quick Draws, RURPS and/or copperheads, beaks, RPs, and small cams, a few stoppers, maybe a KB or so.","location":"Just right of The Good Book."},"__v":0},{"_id":"WdZJv3JdVfK+5k2g38eWSw==","name":"The Good Book","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Kevin Powell & Alan Roberts, 1982","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.13893,33.99344]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105964912","mp_crag_id":"106655623","climb_id":"WdZJv3JdVfK+5k2g38eWSw==","areaRef":"2ki9syTFXY6EAYlLEKrzww=="},"content":{"description":"Climb \"Crystal Calisthenics\" to the ledge, then continue up the big left facing dihedral.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"RzuO4BsnU+GLe1cYwgVkQQ==","name":"Darva","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Todd Gordon, Tucker Tech","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.13893,33.99344]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"106777129","mp_crag_id":"106655623","climb_id":"RzuO4BsnU+GLe1cYwgVkQQ==","areaRef":"2ki9syTFXY6EAYlLEKrzww=="},"content":{"description":"This sad climb goe up grainy, poor cracks and then up grainy loose face climbing.
