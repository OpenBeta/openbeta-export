Walk around Indian Creek Crack and make your way into the corridor.  The corridor is about 3 feet wide and its sort of a chimney climb.  The route is like a mini firewater chimney climb with a few bolts and tops out where the other routes on the main wall are.  Start the climb stemming up to the first bolt.  There is a short crack to the left that we got gear into to make it to the next bolt.  The 2nd bolt has a partner for some reason 2 feet parallel (we only clipped one).  There is another bolt 15 feet up that you can clip from a ledge with a quick link on it.  We used this as a directional and belayed from the top rock behind the corridor.  Fun different route.","protection":"4 bolts, 2 used for protection, 1 for a directional, 1 is useless.
