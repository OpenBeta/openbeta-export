Once past the horizontal crack the angle relents, the holds become huge and the bolts become more spaced until the anchor is reached.  An excellent route with fun movement and good rock that affords great vistas down into Dodge City Canyon and the surrounding area.

The crux will be found around the vicinity of the fifth bolt with easier moves leading to the top and a bolted anchor/rap.\n\nThis spectacular route is well worth the rugged thirty minute approach. Almost a sport climb, except for the crack start, but the rest of the route is protected like one. Four stars out of five for enjoyable positioning and the high-quality moves.\n\nThis photogenic route was featured on the front and back cover of Alan Bartlett's \"Rock Climbs of Indian Cove\" guidebook (1st edition).","protection":"7 bolts, 2.5\" piece, bolted anchor/rap (all bolts 3/8\")","location":"Located on a northerly-facing block that faces towards the left side of the Corral Wall, this climb is shady most of the day.
