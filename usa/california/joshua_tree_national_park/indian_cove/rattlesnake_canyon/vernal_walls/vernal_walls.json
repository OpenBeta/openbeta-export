The left one is wider and on the edge of the formation. The right one is in solid black varnish and ends in a section of white rock. At this point the route traverses into the left crack, passing through some fractured rock (probably PG at this point).\n\nTechnical thin face and lie backing skills are required. Rarely do you find a jam, although solid gear is available for the whole crack. Small but solid fractures throughout the vernish allow for edging.\n\nModerate climbing leads to a large feature for a rest. Harder moves lead to edges at the top of the crack. At this point, technical crimping leads left to the other crack. No gear is available for the traverse, so make sure your last piece is solid. Some loose rock detracts (or perhaps adds) to the experience. Continue up easier terrain to the top.\n\nDescend to the left back to the packs.","protection":"Thin cams and medium nuts to start, single hand size to finish.
