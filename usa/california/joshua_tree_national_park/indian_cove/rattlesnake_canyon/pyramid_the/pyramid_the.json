Carefully surmount the horn at the top of the ear to another ledge at the base of a flared slot. Belay here or continue up the glorious squeeze chimney using good edges. The slot widens up to the base of a constriction that forces you to exit the chimney (crux). Once around the constriction, dive back into the chimney and grovel up to a big ledge at the top.
