Decent rock with some kitty litter on the cracks but not too bad.\n\nI'd imagine it's been done before but couldn't find any info on it at all despite the obvious line and location. If there is another name please change it/comment.\n\nI had some durian there a couple of days before, there is some sharp rock as usual for J-tree, and the crack is like the opening of a durian, so just thought the name was good.","protection":"Standard rack to #3. The main crack on second part can be a bit dirty so nuts are good too. # 3 is handy near the top.\n\nSeveral options for an anchor, I had a #4 and that was handy for an anchor.","location":"Descent can be done by walking down the back or with an easy rappel off rap rings on Bug on a Wall (when you top out just got right around the corner and between the rock walls, , you can see the rings if you look right on the rock face)"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,078f962c-2c44-5024-9ab7-c6cf3b9523f6,477b5c74-631a-5bb0-8a4f-e27c72666508,0c8f5670-9f9b-5ad3-bd2b-853cbd68972d,e0094a29-f7df-5583-87cc-1c3da9bbee87","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Indian Cove","Group Campsites Road","Group Campsite  1","Group Camp  1 Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.15796,34.09694]},"bbox":[-116.15850300864912,34.096490339818125,-116.15741699135089,34.097389660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107265417","area_id":"4AlKKfffVYOHzBw9qbvuhw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.15850300864912,34.096490339818125],[-116.15741699135089,34.096490339818125],[-116.15741699135089,34.097389660181854],[-116.15850300864912,34.097389660181854],[-116.15850300864912,34.096490339818125]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:03.087Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:18.525Z"}
