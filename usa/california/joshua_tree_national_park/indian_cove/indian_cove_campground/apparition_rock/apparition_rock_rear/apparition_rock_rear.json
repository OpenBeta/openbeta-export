The second half follows the middle of the crack, using the nice hand-holds towards the top, and eventually ends on another platform. You can then follow the side of the peak to the top anchors of Shish-Ka-Bill.\n\nA great introductory sports climb to learn using quick-draws and setting up a top-rope climb from the top without having to climb the 5.8 if you are not ready. Once setup, it is a great test for beginners to do laps on. Especially focusing on weight shift and hand holds on the top half.","protection":"There is a shared bolt in the middle of the route.
