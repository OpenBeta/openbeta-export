It's easy to find -- even though it's a couple hundred yards up the hillside, it's easy to spot from the road.  Beware, though:  the cave is MUCH bigger and MUCH further away than it looks from the road.  Chimney up the back of the cave past a large chockstone and continue up a wide crack to the summit.  Taller folks will have a definite advantage in the initial chimney\n\nThe climb is pretty damn near unprotectable which, coupled with the extremely crumbly rock, can make this a slightly nervous experience.  Still, it's an entertaining little adventure in a nice setting.\n\nDescent is pretty straight forward -- keep heading back and the hillside will pretty much come up to meet you.  Then it's a long boulder hop back to the road.","protection":"Not much.
