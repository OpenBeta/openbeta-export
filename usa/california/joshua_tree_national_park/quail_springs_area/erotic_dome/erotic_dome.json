Personally, I think this is the best route at this small crag.  The climbing is reachy, challenging, continuous, interesting, engaging, and exciting.  A few of the moves are powerful, and you have to hang in there.  The hardest moves may be at the start.  At the top, there is a move past a bolt that stumped Hidetaka Suzuki for a few moments;  he didn't get it his first try.  If you climb at this grade, this is a worthy climb.","protection":"There are a few fixed things  (bolts, piton, and there used to be a fixed stopper near the top too;..I bet it's gone; it didn't seem too \"fixed\".)

At this point move right and continue in the thinner crack above through a steeper section to a ledgy topout.\n\nThe crux is the move to the right when the initial crack ends. It's a reachy and awkward face sequence, and is much harder than the rest of the route, which detracts a bit from the climb IMO. That said, it's still a worthy route.\n\nRap from either of the bolted anchors described in the comment below or walk off/downclimb either left or right.
