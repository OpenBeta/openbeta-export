Up above some hand to fist sized cams will go nicely and may even work in the flared portion.\n\nTo set up a TR, you will need some time.  Hike around the back of the wall to what is known as Rock Garden Valley, the seldom visited right side.  Continue up the various gullies well past the \"right side\" routes and then make a move up a cleft and walk the summit ridge northward.  At some point you will see the rap chains for the \"Right Side\" routes.  From these chains walk 10 paces back in the direction you came from and Are You Experienced will be over the other side.\n\nYou will need some sort of extendo rope and a handful of cams in the 1.75\" to 3.5\" range.  There is a good horizontal crack for the pro about 15ft down from the actual summit.  You will probably need two ropes to reach the ground.
