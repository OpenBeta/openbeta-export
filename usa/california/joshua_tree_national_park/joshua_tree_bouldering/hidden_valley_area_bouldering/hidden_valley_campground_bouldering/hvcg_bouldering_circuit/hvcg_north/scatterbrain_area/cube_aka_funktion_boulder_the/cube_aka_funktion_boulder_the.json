Start via either a dynamic move to a crimp or perhaps from cheater stones if present. A few big, fun lockoff moves lead past a rail and on to better holds further and further above a rather dicey landing. The topout isn't too perplexing, but it does involve a little slab at the very top and you're pretty far off the deck.","protection":"A few pads would be nice but falling from the top is probably not a good idea anyway.","location":"As per the Function boulder, this problem is on its south (or southeast?) face (not the one with a rivet ladder).
