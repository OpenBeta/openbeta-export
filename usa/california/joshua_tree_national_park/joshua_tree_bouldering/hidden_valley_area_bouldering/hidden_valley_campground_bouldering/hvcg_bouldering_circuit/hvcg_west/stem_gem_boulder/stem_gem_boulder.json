Please ask permission for bouldering in occupied campsites.\n\nStem Gem is the Quintessencial JTree boulder problem, embodying the essence of Joshua Tree climbing: Highly technical and often times perplexing movement across extremely friction dependant, featurless granite. Indeed, this problem has nary a hold on it, the only thing making it climbable is its coarse friction and the undulating nature of the stone.\n\nGetting both feet off the ground on this problem can be an event in itself, bringing ones flexability and stemming prowess to task. Start by stemming up the concave face and then traversing right across a faint/blunt arete. Most continue right and stand on the \"bump\", however it is possible to avoid the bump and friction direct (v3 friction in itself), continue up the water groove and to the top of the boulder. Jump across boulder to get off.","protection":"standard bouldering gear","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"iErQWzVMWg2JbXaRmf94Pw==","name":"Slam Dunk","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16368,34.01716]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"112365563","mp_crag_id":"106041670","climb_id":"iErQWzVMWg2JbXaRmf94Pw==","areaRef":"Z0FzDy6HXKSEBUaRWjp/VA=="},"content":{"description":"Jump off the small boulder, which gets lower the closer you are to the Stem Gem boulder.
