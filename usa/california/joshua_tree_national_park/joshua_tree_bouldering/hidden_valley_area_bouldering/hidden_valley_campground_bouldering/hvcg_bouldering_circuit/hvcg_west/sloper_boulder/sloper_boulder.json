Continue to the top making more of the same moves to an easy top-out. Downclimb a bit and then jump off the northeast side of the boulder to descend.\n\nThe rock on this is fairly gritty, but it has improved over the years and shows what a fair bit of traffic can do to help clean up a problem. Although some may consider this a \"bomb\", the problem actually features some cool moves that go at a reasonable grade - if this was Yosemite granite it would be rated much harder, although certainly easier on your skin.","protection":"pad","location":"Located on the west face of a boulder which sits 50' southeast of Stem Gem."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,5fd75b2f-4718-50ad-b135-aaff48923d89,2cc405d8-8121-585a-8161-68f9e17141c1,0285ed70-2e79-5ee7-aa37-09bfc65b9940,54041076-a6f3-5145-9b7d-305c82fdde77,83f1e436-e742-5b43-b442-479301406779,618e80d9-5441-59cd-8ef8-0868f18cc14b","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","*Joshua Tree Bouldering*","Hidden Valley Area Bouldering","Hidden Valley Campground Bouldering","HVCG Bouldering Circuit","HVCG West","Sloper Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16351,34.01717]},"bbox":[-116.16405249786264,34.016720339818136,-116.16296750213738,34.017619660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106046706","area_id":"YY6A2VRBWc2O+Aho8YzBSw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.16405249786264,34.016720339818136],[-116.16296750213738,34.016720339818136],[-116.16296750213738,34.017619660181865],[-116.16405249786264,34.017619660181865],[-116.16405249786264,34.016720339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:20.308Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:38.712Z"}
