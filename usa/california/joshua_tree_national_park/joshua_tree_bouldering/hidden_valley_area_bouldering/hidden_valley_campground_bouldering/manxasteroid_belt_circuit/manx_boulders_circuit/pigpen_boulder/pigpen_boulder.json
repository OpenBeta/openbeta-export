An exceptionally powerful and beta intensive line, bring all your core strength for this one!\n\nStarting at the well chalked \"tongue\" where Pigpen starts, toss rightward straight into a small crimper and an eventual match at the ridiculous bowl underclings, then make a huge move to a sidepull with thumbcatch and apply various foot trickery with more hueco/bowl underclinging to eventually reach down and around to slopers above the lip. Surf the good lip slopers back left to finish on jugs.\n\nStarts in your face and doesn't let up at all until you're out of the sidepull, at which point it relents. A true masterpiece that combines a brilliantly cryptic beta puzzle with raw, sustained body tension and accuracy.\n\nOne of the few harder lines here that is relatively skin-friendly.
