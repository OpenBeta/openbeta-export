Two good holds at about head height, one on each side of the arete, will get you started. From there, horrible left hands on dimples and texture (calling them \"holds\" is kinda laughable), some heel trickery, and positive but well spaced right hands will take you to the summit. Probably the most do-able of the problems at this grade in JT, reachy but not too morpho. Due to the minute, sloping nature of half the holds, you'll want cold temps.","protection":"A couple of pads is nice. The landing is flat, but there is a large ledge/boulder/ridge kind of thing that is possible to hit (likely with your head if you did) that you'll probably want to pad. Recommend 2-3 pads and a spotter or two.","location":"This is the namesake problem on the Tidal Wave boulder. The boulder is directly adjacent to Dino's Egg and the Iron Door Cave, in the Outback.
