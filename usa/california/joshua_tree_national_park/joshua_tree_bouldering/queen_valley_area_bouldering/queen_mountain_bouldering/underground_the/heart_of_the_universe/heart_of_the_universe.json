Reach around to the jugs along the lip of the arch (extra style points for toe hooking the hole!) and top out.\n\nSuper unique and cool looking boulder, but the consensus among the three climbers I was with is that it's V2 / V2+ (the guidebook rates it a V4**). Definitely worth checking out though, not only for the boulder, but for the absolutely beautiful view.","protection":"Pads","location":"Joshua Tree / The Underground / The Heart of the Universe\n\n34.0593056,-116.1029139"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,5fd75b2f-4718-50ad-b135-aaff48923d89,91f4c768-9102-5528-a452-0e3e25afa85b,373b641b-51f5-5b1d-b167-908fa7f29b45,fc573202-0ed6-51f8-9ebb-9621ba5faba5,b32cc8af-345e-51c8-963b-a25f96b42a14","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","*Joshua Tree Bouldering*","Queen Valley Area Bouldering","Queen Mountain Bouldering","Underground, The","Heart of the Universe"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0"},{"count":1,"label":"V2+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.10294,34.05928]},"bbox":[-116.10348276725219,34.05883033981814,-116.10239723274782,34.05972966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120416220","area_id":"syzIrzReUciWO6JflrQqFA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.10348276725219,34.05883033981814],[-116.10239723274782,34.05883033981814],[-116.10239723274782,34.05972966018186],[-116.10348276725219,34.05972966018186],[-116.10348276725219,34.05883033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:14.972Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:04.906Z"}
