Move into a knee bar, then through a few slopey pinches made better by a better knee bar. Bump right hand to a slopey pocket, then match, then a fully spread horizontal move to a right crimp, followed by bringing the left foot into a heel hook for a fairly low accuracy left hand bump to a razorblade crimp near the lip. Continue traversing R either through two decent crimps, or, jump to the slopey bread loaf out right and top out. Super fun route!!!\n\nTis a variation of Monkey Gone to Heaven and Skimbles, that stays predominantly inside the bowl of the boulder.\n\nStoked to finally send this route out in Indian Cove. Its an extended variation of Skimbles on Pixie Boulder that adds a few harder moves including a rough match, and a low accuracy move to a tiny left razorblade crimp. Two years ago, i fell on the second to last move. Grateful to finally send and surpass my previous self, despite the trials and tribulations of the last years. Yeiiii!!!!
