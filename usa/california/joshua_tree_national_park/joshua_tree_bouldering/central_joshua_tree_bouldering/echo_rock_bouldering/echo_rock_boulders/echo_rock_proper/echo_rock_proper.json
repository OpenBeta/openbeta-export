I did it starting at Double Dip and finishing at Stichter Quits, but either way is good. From Double Dip, the traverse starts easy and gets progressively harder, with the crux coming around the base of the route \"Gone in 60 Seconds\". The climbing involves thin edging and friction, and the rock is totally clean (prolly from the billions of people piddling around at the base). Its possible to climb higher or lower, but my feet never went higher that 5ft from the ground.","protection":"Pads optional!","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,5fd75b2f-4718-50ad-b135-aaff48923d89,63380000-0332-5dfa-85dc-3c94d533ba53,f6616dd1-8510-5e4b-b242-5ba24114c3a6,efbcbfd4-7577-5b13-afd6-c0cc9fdfdf31,817a1f8d-715c-5971-bdaa-5ccd356fb7bf","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","*Joshua Tree Bouldering*","Central Joshua Tree Bouldering","Echo Rock Bouldering","Echo Rock Boulders","Echo Rock Proper"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.15651,34.02539]},"bbox":[-116.15705255040425,34.024940339818144,-116.15596744959574,34.025839660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107009818","area_id":"gXofjXFcWXG9qlzNNW+3vw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.15705255040425,34.024940339818144],[-116.15596744959574,34.024940339818144],[-116.15596744959574,34.025839660181866],[-116.15705255040425,34.025839660181866],[-116.15705255040425,34.024940339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:14.970Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:32.885Z"}
