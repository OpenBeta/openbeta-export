Like Yosemite's Midnight Lightning, Hueco Tank's Ghetto Simulator or Boulder's Monkey Traverse, Gunsmoke requires little introduction.\n\nThe Gunsmoke Traverse is L-shaped and is usually done from left to right.  Start as far left as possible, move right along the wall for about 50' past 2 crux sections, turn the corner (third crux), and continue another 35' along rails to a final bulge.  If your guns aren't too smoked, reverse your moves back to the start.\n\nGUNSMOKE IS LIKELY THE SINGLE MOST CROWDED ROUTE IN THE PARK, and it's not uncommon to find a dozen or more people there at any given time.  Several other quality problems can be found in the vicinity, including the classic stemming problem\n\nStreetcar Named Desire\n\n(V6) and\n\nThe Chube\n\n(V2).
