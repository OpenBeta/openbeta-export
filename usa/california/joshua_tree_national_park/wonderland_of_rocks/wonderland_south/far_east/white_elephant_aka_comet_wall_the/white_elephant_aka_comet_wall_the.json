Probably the only route in Joshua Tree that was ever submitted to the American Alpine Journal. In his words - \"with some probing, we found a long face, almost four pitches, in a large formation east of the main campground... The entire ascent was free and on good rock with a maximum of F8 on the last pitch to the summit.\"\n\nThe route starts below and left of the obvious \"White Elephant\" flake, hanging 50' up the wall. A minor bushwhack gets you started on route. All pitches are short (<70') and many can be combined with proper slinging of gear.\n\nP1: Lieback a sharp thin flake and follow a crack to a stance (5.5).\n\nP2: Climb a flaring groove with hand crack in the back past a small chockstone to a spacious ledge (5.6).\n\nP3: Move 30' left off the ledge and climb up a slot/squeeze, and then continue up a short section of face to the base of the summit block (5.5).\n\nP4: An exposed and excellent (but short) splitter thin hands crack goes up the summit block on it's northwest side (crux, 5.8).\n\nBeta from Big Al Bartlett can be found\n\nhere","protection":"Standard rack","location":"Left side of the White Elephant (Comet Wall).
