Continue past a couple bolts and traverse left under the imposing headwall.  Traverse past several bolts and belay at the left end of the headwall.\n\nPitch 2: Climb up a bit, then angle up and left.  You might be able to place a couple pieces, but this pitch is basically runout on easier climbing.  Aim for a notch in the upper headwall, pull the steep move and set a belay above.  This might stretch a 60m rope.  Pitch 2 can be broken into two pitches, with an intermediate belay at a double bolt anchor in the middle of the pitch.","protection":"Bolts, some tiny nuts and small cams, long runners and quickdraws.
