Hotpants is a 5 bolt route that features large holds, spaced far apart. Be prepared for Houdini tricks to move from one large feature to the next.\n\nRecently (2013), Alan Moore did the third ascent, some ten years after Chris Righter did the second ascent.\n\nWell worth the walk. Full value for the grade. Like power endurance bouldering with a rope.","protection":"5 bolts, anchors on top","location":"Hotpants is located on the West Face of the Don Genero Boulder, deep in the Wonderland of Rocks. Head out the Wonderland Valley to the Wonderland Wash, passing Freak Brothers Dome. Work your way far north and east to finally arrive at the Don Genero Boulder.
