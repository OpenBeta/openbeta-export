It is a long route, however the start is very low angle so technically you aren't climbing for 165 feet. This isn't a destination climb so don't hike out here to do just this route, the roofs on the South face look a lot more appealing but much harder. And Bighorn Dome, Cornerstone & Poodlesmasher are not far from here either. If you are looking for a quiet day with zero crowds this may be your ticket. Check out Page 331 of the Randy Vogel J-Tree guide printed by Falcon.","protection":"There is one bolt, but it is rusted and is not reliable at all. You can get pro in the crack (it is consistently #1 Camalot sized all the way up) the crack is a bit shallow though so it definitely won't eat gear.","location":"Follow the obvious line up the West face. There is a walk off on the back but it is 4th class, maybe even 5th class with a spicy blind step down and a sharp chimney squeeze. An option to consider if you want to throw a rope down and TR instead."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,60b73411-729d-5d2a-aa7f-7b448ebd9f93,c89f128d-a411-5a68-95d2-60ff44fe5945,44ed9409-582d-597f-abe9-ec043393d062,a338d480-08fe-5add-afd2-98b02d69a186","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Wonderland of Rocks","Wonderland South","Near East","Way Gone Dome"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.13303,34.04422]},"bbox":[-116.1335726708447,34.043770339818145,-116.13248732915528,34.04466966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106930745","area_id":"ozjUgAj+Wt2v0piwLWmhhg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:09.442Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:15:10.819Z"}
