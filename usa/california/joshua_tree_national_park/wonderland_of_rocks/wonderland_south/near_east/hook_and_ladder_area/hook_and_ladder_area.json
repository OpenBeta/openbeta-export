The only problem is the crack starts about 15 feet off the deck.  Hmmm... If I only had a ladder.  Turns out, in this case, Mike and Randy had a ladder, salvaged from the nearby stamping mill.\n\nClimb the ladder, top step, and reach up for the incipient crack. The moves to get established in the crack proper are commiting, fairly hard, with high excitement potential. Your amusement in using the ladder turns to sick anticipation of a reaquiantance on the way down.\n\nHowever, all is not in vain as perseverance allows one to enjoy sick fingerlocks as the feet struggle to find sustenance. The crack gently widens from fingers to thin hands to sinkers. At the top of the crack look down the maw of Poodle Boy. Make sure there are no cams to hook down below.\n\nAfter you and your partner exchange high fives for completing a route shrouded with difficulty, obscurity, and genuine originality, go ahead and simulrap off, cause there ain't no convenience up here!","protection":"HB brass!
