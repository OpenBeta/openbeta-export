Climb up a crack and then sling the \"monster hole\" for protection. Grab the hole, swing around onto the south face and then stuff a leg into the hole which enables you to clip a bolt above the hole. The crux (5.10b or thereabouts) is exiting the hole, which is quite awkward and somewhat bizarre, but once stood up a short bit of friction (5.9) leads to the spacious summit.\n\nThis is a novelty route which is truly hard to rate as it involves climbing moves seldom used on your typical Joshua Tree route. Short but interesting all the way through, this might be just the thing to break up that long hike in or out of the Wonderland of Rocks.","protection":"1 bolt, bolted anchor/rap (all 5/16\"), slings, gear to 2\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"wDXY5NOaX9K8/8QeLfAspA==","name":"The Mom-ster","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Todd & Donette Swain, Nancy Giesmar, Ken Wylie 02-2002","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14133,34.03591]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"110095671","mp_crag_id":"105815172","climb_id":"wDXY5NOaX9K8/8QeLfAspA==","areaRef":"jRf5OJdzUgGWzMeU4ifKxQ=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the rappel line of The Monster formation (the left skyline of the as shown in formation picture).","protection":"No protection on route; anchors on top for rappel or TR.","location":"This route climbs the west (trail end) face of the formation along the rappel line."},"__v":0},{"_id":"aivfU8o5UOa2gcFX0nsrCw==","name":"The Cre-cha","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Todd & Donette Swain, Nancy Giesmar, Ken Wylie 02-2002","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14133,34.03591]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"110095675","mp_crag_id":"105815172","climb_id":"aivfU8o5UOa2gcFX0nsrCw==","areaRef":"jRf5OJdzUgGWzMeU4ifKxQ=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the west side of the Creature overhang (the opposite side from Monster Hole).","protection":"TR from Monster Hole rappel anchor.","location":"This route ascends the northwest side of the overhang, opposite Monster Hole."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,60b73411-729d-5d2a-aa7f-7b448ebd9f93,c89f128d-a411-5a68-95d2-60ff44fe5945,7582b417-7535-5201-9338-71fd6a06c662,8d17f938-9773-5201-96cc-c794e227cac5","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Wonderland of Rocks","Wonderland South","South Wonderland Approach","Creature, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.14133,34.03591]},"bbox":[-116.14187261767844,34.035460339818144,-116.14078738232153,34.036359660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105815172","area_id":"jRf5OJdzUgGWzMeU4ifKxQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:10.249Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:50.794Z"}
