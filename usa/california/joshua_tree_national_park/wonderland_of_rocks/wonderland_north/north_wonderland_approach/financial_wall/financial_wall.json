It takes a hand crack with a pod up to a traverse right into another hand crack.\n\nThis is a stout climb with a continuous nature.  Moves start right off the deck with an awkward series to gain the base of a pod.  Here the left lean and wide crack makes this perhaps the crux of the route.  A rest can be eked after this in the flare at the base of the hand traverse.  The traverse is an airy set of moves, without much help from the feet.  From here deep hand jamming with an even more pronounced left lean finish the route.\n\nEasy descent climber's right.","protection":"Full Standard Rack plus a #3.5 or a #4 Camalot.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"DEm09yn+WleCLWFbOqnIfw==","name":"Capital Gains","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Alan Bartlett, Rosanne Gillmore, April 1995","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.17459,34.04971]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105724753","mp_crag_id":"105721435","climb_id":"DEm09yn+WleCLWFbOqnIfw==","areaRef":"WVOxQL7EWv+h5wag+HAagg=="},"content":{"description":"Just right of Higer Yield this route passes a bush about 35' up.
