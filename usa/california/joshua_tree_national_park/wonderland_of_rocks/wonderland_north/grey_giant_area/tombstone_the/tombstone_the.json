Begin in a diagonal finger crack adjacent to a narrow and discontinuous ramp. Climb to a two bolt belay. The second pitch (5.11+ s) on the slightly overhanging portion of the wall is sustained and difficult from the onset. A fixed copperhead protects moves to a bolt (1/4\") and then three more fixed copperheads in a seam lead to a nice finger crack about 10' from the bolt. The fourth copperhead is very loose; don't bother clipping it. The climbing eases to a ledge at the base of a cave-like depression where the second pitch ends. The third pitch (5.10) climbs out of the depression onto a grainy face / slab protected by two bolts (1/4\") to the top of the Tombstone. From the top, downclimb to a bolted anchor (1/4\" bolts) on the east end that is used for Heaven Can Wait and The S Cracker.
