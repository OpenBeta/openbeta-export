The new 5.8 Fuzzy Energy is a nice long 120+ route a 60 mm will make it to the bottom on the right of Fuzzy Energy. Hike in from boy scout parking lot heading towards Outer Mongolia you will see Asian Buttress on your left after about 45 mins, behind and west of Asian Buttress you will find Fuzz Bumper.
