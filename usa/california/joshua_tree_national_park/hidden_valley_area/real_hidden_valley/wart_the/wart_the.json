This route is deceptively awkward for the 34\" of real climbing it offers.  I did it right side in, left side in, and stacked it, and none of them were great... or graceful.  There are some tricks to all them methods, but this no place to tell them... get in there and start wiggling.  Really good route with one or two interesting moves.","protection":"I placed a 2\" cam, another 2\" cam, and then a #6 Wild Country Cam.  If you want to pro the moves out of the pit a the start, use something in the 1.5\" range.  Summit takes 2\" to 3\" cams for an anchor.","location":"This route goes up the obvious roof to wide crack on the south west face of the Wart.  You can start low in a pit to get an extra 10 feet of extra clean thin hands if you desire.  If not, step off the boulder at the base and skip the clean hands.  Easy downclimb to climbers right."},"__v":0},{"_id":"Ro6gn9EGUWmic8SFg28ndw==","name":"Preparation H","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"John Bachar, Kevin Powell  1979","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16819,34.01408]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105821287","mp_crag_id":"105806247","climb_id":"Ro6gn9EGUWmic8SFg28ndw==","areaRef":"TbwTGaLEWpeA0X8iPV85wQ=="},"content":{"description":"","protection":"Pro for TR","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,bbf60ea4-d8bb-5949-a144-061868db1e5e,40f14019-3439-5a7d-993e-9d8eae4d797e,4dbc1319-a2c4-5a97-80d1-7f223d5f39c1","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Hidden Valley Area","Real Hidden Valley","Wart, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16819,34.01408]},"bbox":[-116.16873247811708,34.013630339818135,-116.16764752188291,34.014529660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105806247","area_id":"TbwTGaLEWpeA0X8iPV85wQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:00.281Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:59.587Z"}
