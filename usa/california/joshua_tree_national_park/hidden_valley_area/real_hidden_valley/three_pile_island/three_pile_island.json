Throw those concerns out the window, it was redpointed for a probable 3rd ascent on 01/12/11, and there are no obvious broken holds...none that affect the difficulty anyway.\n\nStart in the large undercling (tough getting started if you're 5'9\" or under), clip the first bolt, rail out left in the undercling, and launch into the 3 move crux. Clipping the second bolt is sketchy, it's in a poor location for the moves (bolted on lead from hooks, I'd guess) and if you blow it while pulling rope to clip you'll probably hit the ground. There is a decent hold to clip from once you've finished the last move of the crux, but it's still awkward.\n\nHave a very alert belayer, because even coming off the crux moves is pretty close to groundfall, nothing to worry about if your belayer does their job but heads up anyway. Once the second bolt is clipped the routes eases way off.\n\nBeware of the first big knob feature at the start of the crack, it could probably be kicked off, but is a somewhat crucial handhold, so please don't stand on it.\n\nThis is one of the easier routes of the grade in Josh, and not sustained, basically a V7-ish boulder problem with much easier climbing below and above. Fun climbing, good rock, and deserving of a couple of stars.","protection":"Two bolts, a fixed LA, a .5 camalot (for the horizontal right of the pin which will protect the next bit and act as a backup to the ancient pin), and a green alien.
