Continue away from the nature trail about 200 yards and it is on the left, facing almost directly at the Thin Wall.\n\nThis finger to fist crack begins with a small roof.  You get to run the gamut on this shorty, everything from fingers, thin hands, to big teacups/fists.  Well worth doing, and fairly high on the obsure scale for how far it is off the beaten path.  Combine with Magnetic Woose to get your money's worth for the long hike.","protection":"Standard rack.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,bbf60ea4-d8bb-5949-a144-061868db1e5e,40f14019-3439-5a7d-993e-9d8eae4d797e,a1de1eaf-0fea-5ec1-9cb1-eecb08d4bc1f","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Hidden Valley Area","Real Hidden Valley","Otter Cliffs, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.17267,34.01339]},"bbox":[-116.1732124737083,34.01294033981814,-116.17212752629169,34.01383966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106621120","area_id":"od4erw/qXsGcse7LCNS8Hw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:00.279Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:39.625Z"}
