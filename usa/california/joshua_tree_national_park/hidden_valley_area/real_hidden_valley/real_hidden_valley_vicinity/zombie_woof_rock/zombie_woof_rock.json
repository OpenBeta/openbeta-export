In the spirit of fairly warning people of sandbags by changing the upgrading to 5.10d (we all know 10d is harder than 11a, right?), the newer book has reduced the odds of a suprise on this route.\n\nClimb up an unprotected slab (easy) into an unprotected right-facing corner (moderate, but watch for loose rock) and up under the roof.  Get a few placements of protection under the roof and start negotiating outward and upward. Solve a scrunch problem, place another cam, then get horozontal on some wide-hands jams and out to the lip of the roof to a great chock-stone grip and 'rest' on steep ground where protection comes easy again.  Fight the pump and continue up to the topout on good holds but steep terrain to reach the top out.","protection":"A run of cams from .5\" to 3.5\" (blue camalot) with a few extras around the hands-wide hands sizes if you like a lot of pro.
