Passing the third bolt is the crux, and we continued left through the roof to a slightly  grainy, but positive crack. Barlett describes the route moving right through another crack, but it doesn't look appealing.\n\nDescend via a chimmeny n' crawl to the rear, towards Patagonia Pile.\n\nThe rock through the bolts is an uncommon smooth white stone, which feels almost like sandstone. The steep postive edges and cool diving board feature add to the allure. Given that it has no stars in either guidebook makes it seem like finding a hidden treasure. Plus the name is in a class all its own.\n\nThanks to whoever replaced the hangers!","protection":"3 bolts, light rack from green alien up.
