Continue up the right-trending layback crack feature on bolts.

Scott conceded with \"14a/b.\"\n\nSee below:\n\nScott Cosgrove\n\nI saw many people do the Baby Apes, and lead it -first try-, back in 91? I did clip my bolt on Rastafarian, but still would have hit the deck going for the top. It was a desperate lead and I was happy to have sent it first try.\n\nI never saw the wall as a top rope wall, as the first time I did most of the routes with the exception of Moon Beam, I lead them.\n\nSo, when I put up the Rastafarian, on lead, I did not see it as a breach of style to add a bolt to a mostly independent line. People didn't like it, but no one chopped it and the second ascent of Rastafarian was done by Allen Moore who felt it could be 14b. No holds have change or broken and yes I checked. I didn't know how hard it was at the time, so I gave a joke rating of 13b. It is very hard... So, easy on RTM Allen uprated and I agree...\n\nI have done every line on the wall and feel that gives me the best voice in ratings, I'd say Moon Beam,13a, Baby Apes,12b, Rastafarian,14a/b, Watusi,12c, Dial Africa,12b, Apartheid,12a/b, Tribal Warfare,13a/b, Buffalo Soldier 12c.","protection":"A couple of cams and 4 bolts.","location":"Right of Baby Apes"},"__v":0},{"_id":"I1lPCKoZWZW5hEJUZ0cDdA==","name":"Moonbeam Crack","yds":"5.13a","grades":{"yds":"5.13a","french":"7c+"},"fa":"(TR) John Bachar, 1983  FL: Wolfgang Gullich, 1987","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16039,34.02233]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106711299","mp_crag_id":"106631624","climb_id":"I1lPCKoZWZW5hEJUZ0cDdA==","areaRef":"fzXcN6sWWe2vZcOviEfGgQ=="},"content":{"description":"The Moonbeam crack is short and powerful.
