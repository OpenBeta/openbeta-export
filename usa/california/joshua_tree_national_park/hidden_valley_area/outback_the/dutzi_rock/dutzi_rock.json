If you don't fancy hanging upside down, it has gone with a more conventional horizontal squeeze approach and would be more easily protected that way with readily available cams (6 friend/camalot). The crux is turning the lip, and could go many ways depending on your imagination and/or size of body parts. Strenuous, unique, and whimsically absurd.\n\n* It is not located on the Dutzi Rock proper, but closer to the Echo Cove area (see location section below for more detail).","protection":"Protection on lead would be difficult for this if you bathang it, at least for the first part of the roof. The lip at the start is about 9\", tapering deeper. You could likely push a 6 friend way up in there, but then cleaning or walking it would be a problem or entirely out of the question. Closer to the lip  a constriction goes as narrow as 5\", but on these bathang jobs you want to place the pro behind you so climbing around it would present it's own problems. If you own some Valley Giants, or are bold enough to solo out far enough to get a solid 6 friend, you're loving it.  If you use a horizontal squeeze approach rather than a bathang, you should be able to place and slide a 6\" cam.  TR is easy enough to rig by tying off a tree way back and belaying from the top with the rope running through the crack. Slingshot TR would be problematic as the crack pinches off and is only about 1\" where the rope would run.","location":"Drive to Echo-tee, turn left as for Echo Cove/Rusty Wall and keep your eyes on the base of the hillside to your left. About 100 yards past the large pullout on the right used for Big Moe, there is a one car pullout on the right. Park here. The route is easily spotted as a wide crack splitting a roof on a large boulder, about 200 yards from the road, at the base of the hillside opposite the entrance into to Echo Cove."},"__v":0},{"_id":"Z6uDJef9XMmbLYOq85jVkg==","name":"Fingers on a Landscape","yds":"5.11b","grades":{"yds":"5.11b","french":"6c"},"fa":"Lynn Hill and Charles Cole, January 1980","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16454,34.02621]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"105724363","mp_crag_id":"105721373","climb_id":"Z6uDJef9XMmbLYOq85jVkg==","areaRef":"uOAyXHsjXPC8draf8lMIAg=="},"content":{"description":"This is the right-slanting finger/hand crack about 20' left of a prominent hand crack -\n\nShakin' the Shirts\n\n.","protection":"Gear to 2.5\", with extra thin gear","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"QLwSmeJcXb+a4bPsnVTtmg==","name":"Elusive Butterfly","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Dave Evans & Randy Vogel, December 1976","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16454,34.02621]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"105724354","mp_crag_id":"105721373","climb_id":"QLwSmeJcXb+a4bPsnVTtmg==","areaRef":"uOAyXHsjXPC8draf8lMIAg=="},"content":{"description":"This route climbs the obvious right leaning ramp/dihedral on the south side of Dutzi Rock.
