It's a fun climb in a location that has a really short, easy approach, yet doesn't have a lot of the traffic of the climbs closer to Hidden Valley.  Not a showstopper, but definitely fun if you're in the area (and aren't you more or less always in the area?)\n\nVogel rates this climb a 5.6 -- if so, it's the hardest 5.6 I've climbed at JT.  Feels like a good solid 5.7 in my book.\n\nAs you enter Steve Canyon from the direction of Hidden Valley CG, Deflowered will be on the right side, about two-thirds of the way up -- on the opposite side of the canyon from Super Roof (Vogel describes this section of Steve Canyon as \"Upper East Side (West Face)\").  Look for a large chimney that splits the face (5.4); Deflowered takes the slightly narrower crack that starts about 10 feet to the right (down-canyon).

A direct start is possible (5.11c/d) but the complete lack of pro keeps people off. Above, gear in the horizontal protects moves up to steep friction past 2 bolts (crux). Higher, a third bolt protects a traverse right to the arete where a 4th and last bolt protects moves to the top.\n\nAs an alternative start, begin some 15-20 right and below the boulder up right slanting cracks to a ledge (5.10a/b). Belay here (to avoid rope drag) and traverse left to the upper bolted face. This is actually the way the first ascent went.\n\nWhen this was first done in EB's, the smearing seemed way hard; modern rubber has taken the bite out of the difficulty.\n\nBTW, There has never been a fixed anchor on top of this part of the formation.
