Face of the West Wall of Steve canyon, in the Niche between the rocks. (S. Rrock with The Orc and Candellabra, N. Rock holding Super Roof and Let's Get Horizontal).This crack is reached by scrambling up into this saddled from the base fo The Orc or anywhere else in the canyon for that matter, then looking South in the niche. A left-leaning crack starts from the ledge and leads to the top.\n\nGuessing at the cause of the name, we did this pitch in tennis shoes, and found it to be of no real detriment.  The difficulty is not related so much to one's choice of footwear as it is to hand size, height (if very very short) and ability to jam.\n\nThere is a fixed anchor over the top, not far back from the edge.
