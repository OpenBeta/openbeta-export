It starts from the left of the formation and works up and to the right, finally exiting about midway along the top of the formation. It can be started in numerous ways: begin with the bolt on \"The Official Route\"..., and it will be 10B; go directly for the left facing flake, and it will be much easier; start to the right and up the ledge system, minimal difficulty. Overcome the flake, work right then up. You'll find two anchors here. Go up the plates and through the notch.
