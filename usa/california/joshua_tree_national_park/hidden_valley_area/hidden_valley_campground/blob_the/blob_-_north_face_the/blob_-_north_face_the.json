The easiest I've found is to locate Hobbit Roof at the base of the backside (west face) of The Blob. From here, scramble up gully to the right to the base of the route.\n\nAt 5.4, The Bong is a fantastic first trad lead and as well as an excellent free-solo. It offers excellent jams and is easy to protect. The crux is a small \"roof\". Beyond the crux, the angle lessens and it's straight-in jamming to the top. Once on top, a large boulder sits directly in-line with the route and offers a quick and easy anchor using a section of the rope or a long piece of webbing.\n\nTo descend, walk to climber's left and downclimb low 5th class terrain with big face holds. This will deposit you about 50' left of the base of the route. Some sideways chimneying will bring you back to your packs.
