Brilliant, tricky, and sustained climbing through the crux. Off the ground, 5.10-ish climbing leads to about the 1/3 height of the groove and the crux. Hard liebacking, stemming, jams, use of the main and two subsidiary cracks and rounded sides, sloping texture, knee bars, and other trickery will see you through. Once you reach the small pin scars a body length from the sloping ledge, it eases way off. The squeeze chimney above is trivial, perhaps 5.7.\n\nThis line is a bit of a funnel and the upper pin scars collect grit, you may want to brush them out beforehand. The rock overall is very good on this one, but it has yet to see much attention and some ball bearings on texture and disintegrating potato chip edges for feet remain...a few more ascents would clean it up nicely.\n\nDick Cilley called this his favorite route at Joshua Tree, and I would put this in the top 5 of hard Josh routes I've been on, despite how short it is. Where a lot of harder Josh routes involve crimping on tiny sharp and often sloping holds, reachy moves, or single shutdown moves, this route feels much different with relatively large features where body tension and creativity mean  more than being able to lockdown razor blades.","protection":"Toprope, although there is just enough gear on this that it could be led safely (no leads to date, and it would be exciting to say the least). A lead would up the difficulty substantially as you would not only have to hang out in ridiculously strenuous positions to place it, but it would also get in the way of some handholds but not to the point of not being able to use them. To set a TR, the easiest option was to angle in from the right by scrambling up blocks then climbing easy 4th class to reach the top of the squeeze chimney. On the climbers' right side of this is a horizontal that will take big gear, 3.5\"-5\" (I used an old style 3.5, 4, and 4.5 camalot). Take long runners, cord, etc to extend the anchor, you'll want to extend maybe 15' down from the crack. With the malevolent flora at the base, (and if you intend on working sections repeatedly) throwing in a directional is a good idea. A fixed nut near the top seems bomber (hammered in copperhead style) and choices in the 0.5\" to 1\" range are available (an orange tcu was perfect).","location":"At the far right end of the east face is this overhanging groove/runnel feature with an intermittent crack line running up the middle of it. Above, is a sloping horizontal ledge and the line then continues as a wide crack/squeeze chimney. The base area has several very large nolina plants."},"__v":0},{"_id":"nZ+hblMvWmKdvQtctmWvUg==","name":"Perfidious","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"John Wolfe & Ken Stichter, 5/70","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16406,34.01838]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105724141","mp_crag_id":"106044095","climb_id":"nZ+hblMvWmKdvQtctmWvUg==","areaRef":"Izs3kAuMVH2MM8azgBcg3Q=="},"content":{"description":"This route can be found in the Vogel Guide rated 5.6 A4, the modern grade is about C2+. It is located on the east face of the Blob up on a platform to the right of Surrealistic Pillar and I'm not afarid any More (behind the campsite with the huge boulder that contains a head and rivet ladder). To gain the platform climb a tree at the base or a crack in a corner to the right of the tree. The route is a thin overhanging crack that is characterized by four fat bolts that were added for free attempts(clipping the bolts lowers the rating and reduces groundfall potenital). Climb a 5.6 ramp to the base of the crack, start with micro nuts and aliens, clipping 4 fixed heads along the way.

Loose rock at the start gives way to strange, overhanging face climbing to a difficult slabby corner section. A loose flake hangs down atop this section like a huge dagger: It must be climbed but if possible, gear placement should be avoided until the next bolt can be reached (runout). The flake might prompt an R/X rating because it's pretty much a requirement to jam or lieback past it. The noise of bats from underneath the flake was somewhat disconcerting as well. After this section, slab climbing leads past the Perfidious anchor towards the large overhang, under which bats and owls nest. Urine and feces are in abundance under the roof. This section is slightly beguiling: either climb straight over the guano-stained overhang (as indicated in the guide) or, as I did, traverse left under the roof, being careful not to slip on the decades of effluvium caked on the rock, until it's possible to join Disco Sucks (.10c). I traversed left until rope drag rendered further movement impossible and belayed in an uncomfortable stance in a corner. Finding a way through the roof to the bolted anchor above might be a better option, and splitting the climb into two pitches would help with the problem of rope drag. Loose rock and excrement make this climb an exciting if not dangerous venture, but the climbing through the first part is still quirky and enjoyable.\n\nA far better way to end this climb is at the Perfidious anchor, which, after the free ascent, is now two modern bolts with chains. If you want a somewhat unpleasant adventure, continue onwards.","protection":"If you're doing the whole pitch, take a full rack to four inches, including doubles and many long slings. Otherwise a selection of quickdraws, sling, and nuts/cams to 2\" will suffice for the short version. No belay anchor unless you're able to finish the pitch directly through the roof. In any case, a rappel can be made from an anchor at the top, situated a plumb line above the new Perfidious anchor. Rappel again from the top of Perfidious. Wear a helmet and make sure no one is below! A cam or two (smallish) are needed for the belay anchor at the base; a quarter inch bolt helps \"protect\" a move to start the climb/reach a suitable anchor location. Also, bees swarmed the crack below the initial belay the year we were up there (2006?); plan accordingly.","location":"Approach as for Perfidious via a fifth class scramble and ledge walk. Look for copious amounts of bat guano at the base and you'll know you're in the right place."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,19a30b80-55c9-565e-8a98-7b5649ebfbb6,bbf60ea4-d8bb-5949-a144-061868db1e5e,5d36a6dc-de67-5816-8947-995c1fe218c3,c8cb3191-9bbe-5faf-917d-059adc07e500,233b3790-0b8c-547d-8c33-c6b3801720dd","pathTokens":["USA","California","Joshua Tree National Park","Hidden Valley Area","Hidden Valley Campground","Blob, The","Blob - East Face, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.16406,34.01838]},"bbox":[-116.1646025055955,34.01793033981815,-116.16351749440449,34.018829660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106044095","area_id":"Izs3kAuMVH2MM8azgBcg3Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:11.014Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:51.556Z"}
