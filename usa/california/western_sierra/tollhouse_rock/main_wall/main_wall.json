The crux involves enjoyable and steep (by Tollhouse standards) edging on nice reddish colored patina. Because this route is so new, there are still some loose patina edges that will eventually break off and thus a bit of care does need to be exercised when choosing what to stand on. Nevertheless, I have given this route 4 stars because I think that in a few seasons, this route will clean up nicely and warrant the given star grade.\n\nThe continuity of the pitches on this climb warrant a bit of comment and I welcome comments by anyone who has additional information. The initial two pitches of this climb are obviously independent and new; this is obvious because the bolts are brand new and the bolt spacing is quite generous (i.e. very well-protected). However, the second pitch ends at the second pitch anchor of Wandering Taoist. At this point, the character of the bolting changes quite substantially. The climbing becomes fairly runout and the age of the bolts seems to indicate that the third pitch predates the initial pitches by quite some time. My guess is that the third pitch was originally an extension of Wandering Taoist; however, the information that I have is written by one of the FA's and thus I have entered the route according to the FA's account (for more information see 'A Climbers Guide to Tollhouse Rock' by Kroll and Slater\n\nmaximuspress.com/shop/proddâ¦\n\n).\n\nPitch One (130 feet; 5.10b, 7 bolts):\n\nBegin by climbing the initial right-facing corner of Elephant Walk (this is really a 15 foot pillar leaning against the wall) and mantle the pillar to the left; some folks may want a medium sized cam to protect this (around a 0.5 Camalot or so).

Trend gently up and right on well featured rock; the climbing on this pitch is exceptionally fun and the bolts are very reasonably spaced. After 4-5 bolts, begin trending back up and left passing the remaining bolts to a ledge and a bolted anchor (this is anchor is also the top of the second pitch of Wandering Taoist and Elephant Walk).\n\nPitch 3 (140; 5.10a; 5 bolts):\n\nThe character of the route changes substantially at this point. Leave the belay and climb straight up 20-25 to clip the first bolt. Follow the bolt line as it trends up and left to a bolted belay station.\n\nVariation:\n\nFor those folks who want to climb the initial, well-protected pitches but avoid the runout third pitch, you can merge onto the final pitches of Elephant Walk instead of continuing up the proper third pitch.\n\nPitch 4 (200 feet):\n\nFinish on either Tollhouse Traverse (gear needed) or Elephant Walk.","protection":"8 slings for clipping the bolts.

Use good judgement.\n\nPitch #1 (5.8):\n\nStart up the crack (pro up to Metolius #5 or #.5 Cam Jr). As the crack begins to peeter out (5.8 crux), head up and right to a ramp leading to a right facing corner (#1 Camelot). From the corner, head up and over a small, slightly flairing roof (poor pro, 5/8 Alien best option). Pass the small roof on it's left (2nd crux 5.8). Continue climbing up and slightly right, passing 2 bolts along the way. A two bolt belay (200 feet) is encoutered at the end of this pitch. This pitch ends at 'Wandering Taoist's anchors. As seen in the Sequoia Kings Canyon guide, the route originally headed a hard left after the roof....creating huge rope drag and runout for 40 feet. The last 2 bolts of this pitch were installed to create a more direct and ethstetic line....without the rope drag!\n\nPitch #2 (5.7R):\n\nStart by ascending directly above the anchor, moving over sloping dishes and good edges, clipping 4 bolts along the way (180 feet). The first bolt is 30 feet from the anchors and the remaining are about the same distance in between, so scan the rock carefully.\n\nPitch #3 (5.7):\n\nTraverse out right then up to a bolt (5.7). (Note: DO NOT HEAD DIRECTLY ABOVE THE BELAY, if you want to continue up the original route.....this is a 5.8+ variation pitch.) Clip the bolt and ascend a small left facing corner (may accept #1 Metolius TCU) to another bolt 30 feet above (there is a bad bolt next to a newer bolt...still not pulled and badly damaged). Pass three additional bolts along the way. As one climbs this pitch, the features slowly disappear and climbing becomes strictly steep friction. Locate a two bolt hanging belay (150 feet).\n\nPitch #4 (5.7):\n\nStart directly up from the achor and pass a left slanting crack (the end of the Tollhouse Traverse).

The left-hand crack comes from under the detached flake resting against the wall, and goes generally up and right.

Old farts will argue about grades and how/easy this pitch is, and I won't add to the debate. I'll just say, it's friction so be mentally prepared if that's not your normal style\n\nPitch 3:Â  Be careful here. Going straight up from the belay puts you on \"The Shining Path 5.10\" which is significantly harder. It's an easy enough mistake to make, as the first two bolts straight up from the anchor are pretty easy looking.\n\nInstead, traverse right from the belay to obviously easier territory. As you follow bolts up, Tollhouse Traverse will come into your view on the right, and a dihedral will loom above and to your left.

All four pitches climb distinct types of rock which makes for continuously interesting and varied climbing. The technical crux comes early on with reasonably well protected friction and smedge climbing. For most, the psychological crux will be the runout 4th pitch. Elegant and rewarding climbing throughout.\n\n1st pitch (~130 feet; 5.9; 5 bolts):\n\nDelicately edge your way up to clip the first bolt and contemplate the next 30-40 feet of crux friction and smedge climbing. While not wildly runout, expect to climb 15-20 feet between bolts with solid friction and smedge climbing on high quality and beautiful white granite; make sure your belayer is with you for bolts 2 and 3 because the ground is quite close given the bolt spacing. After the first half of the pitch, the climbing difficulties decrease slightly and the bolts become more spaced. Excellent pitch.\n\n2nd pitch (~85 feet; 5.7; 2 bolts):\n\nClimb straight up from the belay and clip the first bolt 20 feet up. Spot the second bolt (~30 feet or so) and wander your way upwards; from the second bolt head towards the anchors at the bottom of the crescent arch corner above. The climbing on this pitch is runout, but the climbing is no harder than 5.7 with many small features, dishes, and knobs (not pure friction climbing).\n\n3rd pitch (150 feet; 5.9; 5-6 bolts):\n\nThis is the secondary technical crux pitch. Leave the belay and climb the right-facing arching corner (protected by small nuts and cams) until you pull up and left on the face at a good sized knob and clip the first bolt (alternatively, you can climb straight up from the belay, clip a bolt, and then traverse up and left to the first proper bolt...however, do NOT continue climbing straight up, this is a variation called \"Brains\" which is 5.9 and looked to be quite runout). Next, wander your way upwards on fun, semi-runout, but fairly secure climbing; you will eventually trend up and left to a left facing roof/corner. Just below the apex of the corner/roof, clip a bolt out right on the face above the corner and climb up over the roof and continue upwards to the anchor. There are a fair number of bolts splattered here and there on this pitch. I believe I clipped 5 or 6 bolts without wandering too much. Another fine pitch.\n\n4th pitch (~150 feet; 5.8; 3 bolts):\n\nLikely the mental crux. Climb friction straight up from the belay for 25-30 feet to the first bolt. After clipping the first bolt, continue friction climbing upwards for 40 feet to the second bolt. Continue upwards past a third bolt and belay from gear at a nice ledge.\n\nVariation:\n\nIf you are not up for running it out 40 feet on 5.8 friction, you can take a bit of gear with you and climb a variation to the right (this variation is shown in black on the route topo). However, doing this variation without heinous rope drag will require judicious use of long slings and/or double ropes. Climb up and right (maybe 15 feet) from the belay to bolted anchor at a ledge. Traverse the ledge to the right and clip another set of anchors. Now climb up and right to merge with the crack system (the Upper Traverse route) and follow the crack back up and left passing one more bolt until a roof is reached. Traverse and climb over the roof on the right and continue straight up to the two bolt belay at the base of Munge Master.\n\nExit pitch (~200 feet):\n\nEither exit up and left on 4th class or continue upwards and finish on Munge Master (see Munge Master description).","protection":"6-10 draws for the bolts and gear on the third pitch.
