At the end of this slab will be a left-hand descent to routes such as the Tollhouse Traverse.\n\nInstead, go straight and continue traversing along  a climber's trail below the face, passing the Turret and Friday the 13th.  The climber's trail should peter out at a tree, just below a roof.  The route starts below the left side of the roof.\n\nDescent options:\n\n1. Rappel with either two 60m ropes or conceivably one 70m.  The first rappel should get you to a bolted anchor with rings, which is a belay on\n\nLeapin' Lichen\n\n(5.10a R/X).  Second rappel was ~120', so it might be a bit short with a 70m but\n\nprobably\n\ndoable.\n\n2. Continue up some third-fourth class slab to Cap Rock, and either (a) climb Cuticle Corner (5.7), a short finger crack, to another bolted anchor, or (b) traverse right around the base of Cap Rock to where you can pick up a trail.
