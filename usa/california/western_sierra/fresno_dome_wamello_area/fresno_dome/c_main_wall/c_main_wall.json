Watership Down is the striking right-facing corner which is formed by the right side of this buttress. It will probably catch your eye as it is one of the first impressive features you see as you approach the dome from Zippity-Do-Dah Buttress.\n\nThe pro on this climb isn't great, mostly due to to dirt filled cracks and occasionally loose rock. It's best suited for experienced 5.7 leaders.\n\nClimb up the chimney and lieback the corner to belay at an alcove. Continue up the corner past a tricky offwidth bulge thing (it's best to lieback, but you need to squeeze in there to place pro) and belay at another rubble filled alcove. A final pitch climbs up the corner and traverses beneath a roof to the right. Climb across the face and up onto a ledge with a 2 bolt anchor. There is also a 2 bolt anchor directly above the buttress, but belaying here gives worse rope drag.\n\nYou can either rap with 2 ropes (we've done it with one 70m which is ill-advised, it requires downclimbing to anchors 2 pitches off the deck!), or there's a newly added sport route which climbs straight up from the anchors (the start is a short section of 5.9, then it's easier) which leads to the top of the dome.","protection":"Pro to 3\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"8tEmRpFaVBChafG1HVAD3w==","name":"Unknown 5.10","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.53479,37.45399]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"119967286","mp_crag_id":"106869630","climb_id":"8tEmRpFaVBChafG1HVAD3w==","areaRef":"+yAKfgX9VDOOi3affwC0XA=="},"content":{"description":"Arching to the Â left face climb. 7 bolts to anchor .

Looking Glass is the impressive left-facing corner which is formed by the left side of this buttress. This route is essentially the mirror-image of Watership Down. It is best climbed in two pitches.\n\nThe pro on this climb is not very good, mostly due to to dirt filled cracks and occasionally loose rock. It's best suited for experienced 5.7 leaders.\n\nP1. Starts out with easy scrambling and then alternate between crack climbing, chimneying, liebacking, and often just slab climbing the low angle face to the left of the corner. Belay in an alcove with a bunch of loose blocks. A 70m rope just barely makes it. You will have to break it up or simul-climb the easy start if you are using a 60m.\n\nP2. Climb up the corner towards the roof. Face climb out to the lip and then lieback up the offwidth to the hand crack. I couldn't get any gear until this point and had to run it out a bit. There is a bolted face climb to the left of the corner, which you can join for its final 3 bolts. This provides a cleaner and more enjoyable finish to the mungy corner above, and also reduces rope drag.\n\nFrom the top you can rap with 2 ropes, or finish on Rowsby Woof (5.8) which climbs out the obvious left-trending ramp beneath a giant roof. The final pitch of Rowsby Woof is well worth it.","protection":"Pro to 4\"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,a5ac4815-eeb0-59ad-8b20-08b5ff151027,c6fa6c7a-10b7-566e-a056-ec1f1ce3e8db,a7f86a43-0135-5bbc-9005-aabee812e026,fb200a7e-05fd-5433-8e8b-769f7f00b45c","pathTokens":["USA","California","Western Sierra","Fresno Dome (Wamello) Area","Fresno Dome","c.
