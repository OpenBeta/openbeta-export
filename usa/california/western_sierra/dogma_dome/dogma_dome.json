The problem lies in what has happened to the route since it was put up. The massive branch from which the name comes is dead and lying on top of the bolt line and the good holds you need to climb it. Some of the bolts are new, others are button heads. The button heads are also located where the route drops in difficulty to 5.7 after the small overlap where there is a mega runout (75 to 90ft, hard to tell). So with retro bolting and some tree maintenance, I'd love to see this route revived. When my wife and I climbed it, her lead, she was struggling to lift the huge branch to clip the bolts, then faced a horrific runout protected by a tiny button head at the top. She sent, thank god.","protection":"Bolts, but guide book says pro to 1.5\" although i didn't see a spot for any","location":"Mid wall, look for the huge branch laying on the face over some bolts.
