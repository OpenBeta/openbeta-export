Granite is solid, with Quartz lattice that protrudes in interesting ways from the softer Granite. Many small pockets to make it as difficult as you want, but has plenty of great big solid holds and is slightly less than vertical making it also ideal for beginners. Flat landing perfect for pad. Shaded most of the day. 5 min max easy walk from parking at bridge.","protection":"None. Bring your own pad.","location":"Park at Sycamore Creek bridge and walk upstream along the old asphalt road for approximately 300 yards. Just before the first sweeping left turn wall will be on the right, under a large Live Oak.
