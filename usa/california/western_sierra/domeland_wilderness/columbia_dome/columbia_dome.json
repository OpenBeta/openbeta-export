The original line started to the right up a long bolt ladder with some aluminum dowels to gain a dike, then traversed horizontally left along the dike (5.10b A1) to gain the upper crack. The free variation starts more directly beneath, and the old 1/4\" bolts were replaced with nice stainless 3/8\" hardware in 2019. The belay anchors were also upgraded in 2019, and we made a solid effort to excavate decades of dirt that had filled in the crack on P1.\n\nThe Domelands guidebook shows this route split up into more short pitches - I will describe our ascent as some of those belays did not make sense to us.\n\nP1) Climb up past an overlap and pass 3 bolts as you smear up and then right to gain the crack which starts out as a seam. Belay at bolts atop a bushy stance. 110' 5.11a\n\nP2)  The goods. Follow the 0.5/0.75-size splitter to a thin move and a ledge, then a long sustained 2\" crack to a bolted anchor inside an awkward little pod/alcove. 5.8++ 160'\n\nP3) Long hands to finger splitter with a tips layback crux at the end. The large \"loose blocks\" in the topo have been removed. Bolted anchor at a ledge, 170' 5.9+\n\nP4) Climb up a chimney, then step left to runout but easy and featured face. Gear belay near the left end of the mini headwall/overlap. 200' 5.7\n\nP5) Probably only 4th class, but slabby and super exposed. We chose to keep the rope on. 100' to a gear anchor atop the sub-dome.\n\nFrom here, descend by walking off left on slabby ramps towards the brushy gully. Watch for rattlesnakes. 15 minutes or so back down to the base.","protection":"Standard double rack to 3\". Can't remember if we used a #4 or not, probably optional.","location":"Left side of Columbia's sub-dome. Hard to miss.
