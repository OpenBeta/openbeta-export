The climb is easiest to find by visually following the upper crack down to the ground.\n\nDescent) 30 min, 3rd class\n\nDifficult to explain, but pretty intuitive if you're there. Hike southwest along a long, sandy ledge, with a wall to your left, gaining about 100ft of elevation. Continue to the southwest end of the formation, with occasional 3rd class chasm jumps or grainy downclimbs. Keep an eye open for a low angle slab on your right that will take you back down to the dirt. Once on the ground, hike NE towards your packs.
