Crux down low is protected by a pin. After this, it's all about fighting the pump on steep but great jams and some awesome face holds. Wiggle into the chimney pod at the top and two bolts will be on your right. What a line! One of the steepest cracks of its kind anywhere. A classic fingercrack of California","protection":"Small nut to protect the move to the pin. Then pin. Then doubles from small to #.75. Single #1,2. And triple on #0.5 was nice.\n\nThere are no chains on the anchor bolts. While it is somewhat easy to scramble up the backside to access these and clean your anchor (and also therefore setup a TR, directionals would be needed), chains would be nice. I left some tat.","location":"Obvious line on the Temple of Doom, which is the formation somewhat separated from the rest of the Church Dome(s) by a small drainage. It is a couple obvious towers to the east (right) of the main group. Easy to walk over to from the main area or directly from camp."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,a5ac4815-eeb0-59ad-8b20-08b5ff151027,31eefe79-a47d-51ea-acd7-941e68be9489,471ee644-77f0-5da0-b85c-ea6a5b21ff4c,c6ed8059-da3b-5a71-b95a-e9411c01603f","pathTokens":["USA","California","Western Sierra","Domeland Wilderness","Church Domes","Temple of Doom"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12a/b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.2678,35.8494]},"bbox":[-118.26835475306152,35.84895033981815,-118.26724524693849,35.849849660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106884001","area_id":"xu2AWdo7WnG5WulBHAFgPw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.26835475306152,35.84895033981815],[-118.26724524693849,35.84895033981815],[-118.26724524693849,35.849849660181874],[-118.26835475306152,35.849849660181874],[-118.26835475306152,35.84895033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:49.924Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:00.966Z"}
