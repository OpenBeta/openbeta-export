There are two bolts at the anchor but no rings. An old untrustworthy red sling was tied between the two anchor bolts 10/5/19, and what appeared to be a newish wire crab. I left another on the other bolt for a safer trip back to earth. 9 bolts. No gear required.","protection":"9 bolts. Two anchor bolts, each with a carabiner.
