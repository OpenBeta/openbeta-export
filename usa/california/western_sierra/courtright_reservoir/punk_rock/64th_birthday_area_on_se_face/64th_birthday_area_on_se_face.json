Then it goes up a face to another vegetated gully to the money part of the climb.  The money part involves perfect but easy lieback moves that protect well throughout to another small ledge.  Then you do the crux moves up a face with pulling on a hold to the left to a big ledge.  You need to walk/climb about 30 to 40 back on the ledge to find good anchor placements.  Don't be fooled by the vegetated lower parts as the lieback moves up higher are really good.","protection":"You will need Camalot type cams from 1.0 through 4.0 (4.0 helpful at the crux), a set of Alien-type cams from 0.30\" to 2\".
