Starting underneath the roof of the boulder your hands will start on the huge flake, then the under cling will guide you to the right where you'll squeeze through a gap made from the boulder and a possible flake that's fallen off. From there you'll start working the crack to top out. Like i said really fun boulder, sort of sketch landing on the first part but you will not regret trying out this roadside boulder problem.","protection":"Bring a pad or two. Hopefully a spotter.","location":"Park on the left side of the road of Redwood Dr. right before you get to Sequoia Crest. Very easy to recognize.
