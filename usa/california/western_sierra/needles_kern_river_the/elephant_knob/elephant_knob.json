It is also perhaps the best crack climb on the formation.\n\nStart in a large recess below a gully on the south side of the dome.  Traverses up and right and turn the corner of a blunt arete (5.6).  Climb a finger & hand crack left of a pine tree (5.7).  At a horizontal break, move left and climb a steep fist crack to a sloping ledge (5.7/5.8 and FUN).  Belay takes small stoppers & TCUs.  Rappel the gully to your starting point from slings around a chockstone.  The gully itself can be downclimbed at awkward but easy class 5.\n\nAdventurous climbers may wish to continue up one of three short but sweet fingertips cracks (5.10+).
