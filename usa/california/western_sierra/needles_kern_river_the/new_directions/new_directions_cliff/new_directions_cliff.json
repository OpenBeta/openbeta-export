This climb is the farthest to the left on New Directions Cliff. Starts behind a tree and climbs a 20 wide face and arête on the right. Finishes with a small bowl with 2 rap rings for rappeling. Use 2 60m ropes to rap down. I used an 80m rope to lead, and rap to the bottom. I suggest this route for new climbers or new leaders.","protection":"10 quickdraws are 'needed', but you can skip several bolts as the route is well protected with lots of jugs, and finger crimps at the arete. Someone added several bolts to the left to end up on top of the rock.","location":"This climb is the farthest to the left on New Directions Cliff.
