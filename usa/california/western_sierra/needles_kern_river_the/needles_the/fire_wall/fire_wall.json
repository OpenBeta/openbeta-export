Multiple cruxes pretty much sums this route up: Strange fin-pinching and jamming, a burly undercling, a techy seam, a crimpy face, and a delicate sequence up and around a high arete.\n\nUse caution during the first 40' of climbing as the pro is small, finicky, and the rock is not so good. Above this you can climb with reckless abandon as the falls are clean - though possibly long.\n\nOriginal rating was 12c/d; current book calls it 12a in the index. I think 12c is about right.","protection":"RP's to #1 Camalot. A few slings to minimize drag. Two bolts protect the upper face, then a long fun out to a bolted anchor around the left (south) side of the Fire Wall.","location":"Begin a bit down and left of Pyromania at a steep, right-facing corner capped by a red roof."},"__v":0},{"_id":"kf3Sc022UtebClvvCeNMOA==","name":"Pyromania","yds":"5.13b","grades":{"yds":"5.13b","french":"8a"},"fa":"Tony Yaniro","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.48014,36.1084]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106260546","mp_crag_id":"115328363","climb_id":"kf3Sc022UtebClvvCeNMOA==","areaRef":"L+CAPjzUWjGmyrsC8ic2WQ=="},"content":{"description":"This is perhaps the most visually stunning line in the Sorcerer/Witch amphitheater. It takes the arching undercling crack on the Fire Wall, which is the chartreuse wall that sits below the Sorcerer itself.\n\nEasily TR'd via two rappels from the top of the Fire Wall, and led rather safely if the first piece is pre-placed (otherwise it requires some serious boldness for the poor landing off the initial boulder problem).\n\nThe climb involves two boulder problems: First a long reach or dynamic move. A good rest follows, then a second boulder problem - difficult moves to get out from under a small roof and onto a juggy rail. Hand traverse this rail back right (tricky to protect) to another good rest. The final stretch is endurance underclinging. Positive, but pumpy. An amazingly stunning line, and a lot of fun to climb.\n\nThe anchor at the lip is generally used for top roping - while it is possible to reach down and clip this anchor after the undercling, it is best to finish the route by following the easy finger crack to the top of the Fire Wall.","protection":"Blue TCU's... all of them.\n\nA few wires and RP's are useful as well. I recommend pre-placing/clipping the initial piece to protect from a groundfall. Pre-inspecting the gear on the hand traverse may also be prudent - I used an offset Alien and #2 BallNut.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,a5ac4815-eeb0-59ad-8b20-08b5ff151027,386b0058-0b44-58ea-a468-470945330e5d,6d7a7c8b-89c1-533a-a4c9-6fb263d57ebc,2fe0803e-3cd4-5a31-a6ca-bb02f2273659","pathTokens":["USA","California","Western Sierra","Needles / Kern River, The","Needles, The","Fire Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.48014,36.1084]},"bbox":[-118.48069657660216,36.107950339818146,-118.47958342339784,36.10884966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115328363","area_id":"L+CAPjzUWjGmyrsC8ic2WQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:11.908Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:40:38.090Z"}
