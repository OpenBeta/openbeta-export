We started farther right near a left-facing dihedral, then traversed left (after downclimbing) when the first bolt was finally spotted. Unsure of the direct start difficulty. 2nd bolt hanger was damaged from rockfall (presumably the scar directly above, between bolts 2/3, which altered the route). We traversed directly left from bolt 2 to a small arÃªte/corner, then up a flake (gear), passing left of the third bolt (now skipped) to the belay. (5.7, ~160-190' depending on route taken)\n\nP2 - 5 bolts, fairly straightforward (5.8, ~180')\n\nP3 - gear, we trended left, then back right (other options exist). Bolted belay is directly above P2 belay (5.7, ~180')\n\nP4 - gear, wander upwards, finding a gear belay when possible (5.6, ~180')\n\n100' of 4th class to finish. Descent: walk climber's right, then down the gully and back to the base or road. First 3 pitches have bolted belays.
