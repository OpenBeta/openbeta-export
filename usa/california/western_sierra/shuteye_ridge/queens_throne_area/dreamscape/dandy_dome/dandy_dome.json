The moves off the ground, while not all that hard, are somewhat unnerving as the block used for the hand traverse getting to the start of the flake doesn't appear to be well attached to the main wall. An exciting move lands you on the top of the flake where a one move crux puts you at the start of a long slab climbing past many bolts to a two-bolt anchor.\n\nNote: The guidebook lists this as 55 meters long, but we used almost all of a 70 meter rope. Also, on the descent, the first rappel to the anchor on the neighboring route used nearly all of the same rope. From there one more short rap gets you to the ground.","protection":"Many (16?) draws, 70 meter rope.","location":"See Dandy Dome description."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,a5ac4815-eeb0-59ad-8b20-08b5ff151027,9e6215f2-4119-5ae2-b5e0-98db54e6ffdb,5adfe2b5-2950-5f98-80c2-d4ed2d86da24,dc983b67-b1d2-57b5-942a-ce14e6602513,4402087c-9a9f-5c7f-84a6-01d064c1f0d6","pathTokens":["USA","California","Western Sierra","Shuteye Ridge","Queen's Throne Area","Dreamscape","Dandy Dome"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.44163,37.38356]},"bbox":[-119.44219590294998,37.38311033981813,-119.44106409705003,37.38400966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110997666","area_id":"RAIIfJqfXH+EpgHQZMHw1g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:33.779Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:10:54.471Z"}
