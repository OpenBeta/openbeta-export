Start up an arete with technical moves past two bolts. Clip high and pull the overhang and continue up a cryptic dihedral. Bust another crux past a fixed draw to pull a second roof. The first anchor is right above the roof at ~20m. If continuing to the second anchor it is smart to extend some of the draws on the first section. Continue up an easy section until the face thins to a five foot double arete. Work up using both sides with trickery and small holds. Quite a long route!\n\nIt's 12b to the first anchor. The section to the second anchor is in the 11b/c range.","protection":"7 bolts and a fixed draw on the first pitch. 12 more bolts on the second pitch. The anchor at 20m has mussy hooks. There are chains at the top anchor.","location":"At the far left of the Shape Shifter area. To the right of Va Va Voom. Start on some broken rock on an arete under a huge roof.
