A must do! Like the rest of the Melting Wall routes, this is a pure trad route, allowing one to sling knobs and slot nuts and small cams between patina plates. The route is signatured by three distinct runnels, seperated by vertical fins and plates.\n\nBegin up the middle \"feather\" and work up on knobs and fins, slotting nuts and cams. Seize the opportunity to get in pro when its available. The moves through the middle of the route are very enjoyable and wild, several high step rock overs and stemming from fin to fin. This route can seem to be a bit runout to some if not familiar with creative knob slinging and horizontal nut slotting. Continue upward.
