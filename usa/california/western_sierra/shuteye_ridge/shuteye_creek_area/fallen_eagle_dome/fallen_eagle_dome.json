This necessitates some simul-climbing. Problem is the serious crux moves off the belay (we found them to be at least 9+ if not 5.10); a fall here for the follower could pull the leader off. (Our person seconding had to stand in slings off the anchor to allow enough rope; even then I had to pull all slack out of the rope to get enough to clip the anchor). A 70 meter rope would work well here.\n\nThe third pitch forced us to simul-climb 25 to 30 feet before the leader could reach the top anchor.  This pitch is a full 70 meters.\n\nThe first short pitch called 5.6 in the book we found (all 3 of us) to be AT LEAST 5.8 with no pro at the first hard move.","protection":"A piece or two for the first pitch.
