The 5.9+(+++) second pitch involves a strenuous roof over a potentially nasty ledge fall.  Be prepared for physical and devious  climbing (hint: offwidth technique will help!).\n\nP1 - Hard 10a - 25m - Very strenuous left-facing corner.  Climb it up to the roof using jams, stemming and lie-backing.  From the roof, move up/right to a thin crack (may be overgrown/full of dirt) and continue up a left-slanting crack to a belay.\n\nP2 - 5.9+ -  Note the plus!  Head up the thin pocketed finger crack on sustained climbing.  The first roof is past easily with good gear and jugs.  The second roof features an inobvious sequence beginning with a stem out left and a high jug entering in to the off-width crack at its top.  Be careful, as falling from here would likely land one on the ledge below.  Continue along the easy off-width and belay where convenient.\n\nP3 - 5.8 - 50m - Easy face to the summit.\n\ndescent\n\nDouble rope rap from Drink Till You Stink or head back and climber's right to descend the gully between Red Eagle and Gray Eagle.","protection":"Large rack to single 4\"","location":"On the right side of Red Eagle, starting up the obvious lie-back corner to the right of the red dihedral (huge obvious left facing dihedral)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"kY2pRlwiVrqhCKxAnUgdXA==","name":"Triple Dihedral","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Jack Delk, Guy McClure (1976)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.40986,37.36019]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"113083337","mp_crag_id":"109474707","climb_id":"kY2pRlwiVrqhCKxAnUgdXA==","areaRef":"NDZzaYojXUqLfeTM3mtnXw=="},"content":{"description":"Have you done Wingfeather? Feel like climbing another moderate multi-pitch excursion? This is a good option. There are no bolts, fixed anchors or other blemishes. Just a pure, moderate trad climb.\n\nP1 - climb the easy crack to the big ledge. (low 5th)\n\nP2 - Climb the crack to the right of the diherdal. Alternate back and forth from this crack to the dihedral where appropriate (5.8). Belay at the tope of an obvious ledge. P1+2 can be combined, but why bother?\n\nP3 - Continue up the dihedral, place gear above the dihedral (5.8), the difficulty eases (5.6) and cruz to a nice ledge and set up another gear belay.\n\nP4 - The guide book says to traverse, but we kept going straight up, and belayed at the base of a headwall (5.6)\n\nP5 - The guidebook says go left to a corner, but it was full of algae, so we went straight up the headwall.
