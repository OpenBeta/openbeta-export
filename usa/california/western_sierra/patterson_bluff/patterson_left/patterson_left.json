Leversee put this up in 1986 (with Paul Martzen) and came back 8 years later after recruiting none other than Scott Cosgrove to help him free it. The route snakes its way up the obvious buttress on the left side of the main wall. It features an even mix of crack and face climbing, though most of the crack climbing consists of liebacking and stemming up incredible water grooves and thin seams. An extremely excellent and sustained line. Although obviously a different style, I consider this thing on par with Romantic Warrior in terms of difficulty and quality. Well protected throughout.\n\nI included the original topo which is mostly useful and accurate. However, there are more bolts than indicated and the grades seem pretty off. I put my best guesses here\n\nRappel to the base, hanging draws on the first pitch is a good idea.\n\nP1 - 11b 80ft. - From the nice stance and only gear anchor on the route, climb the corner with a couple finger sized pieces, gain a stance on the arete, and work your way over to the belay ledge.\n\nP2 - 12c 115ft. - Some cosgrove shit, by far the crux of the route, imho. Grade is complete guess. Climb up the shallow corner getting a small piece before the first bolt if you want. 6 more closely spaced bolts take you up and then left through thin crux face climbing transitioning into a crack system. Easier climbing up finger cracks lead to the belay.\n\nP3 - 11c 80ft. - The aid route goes straight up, but downclimb the flake off the belay and then traverse right to the arete. Climb up on jugs to clip the first bolt, slightly scary. Keep traversing right to a final crux move to a jug, you may dyno here. Up a bit to a hanging belay. All bolts.\n\nP4 - 11d+ 90 ft. - Traverse back left on good holds then more straight up. Really hard moves lead into and then up a series of seams. All bolt protected IIRC, but maybe take a finger size piece or two.\n\nP5 - 12a 100 ft. - Up to a stance and the first bolt. Hard moves lead right and up into the groove/crack system. A few more bolts gains a rest. Then head up into the cruxy tips crack and keep going until it gets dirty and you can transition to the nice finger crack on the left. Mostly bolts but take a couple pieces from small to hand size. Nice belay ledge.\n\nP6 - 12a 100 ft. - Easy terrain past a couple bolts lead into the groove with a tips crack in the back. Magic your way up this eventually gaining a nice rest below parallel grooves. Lieback and stem your way up to the belay. Awesome and unique pitch. Lots of bolts and gear.\n\nP7 - 11c 130 ft. - Gain the incredible dike and traverse it up and left to its end. Then head straight up to a great ledge. A piece or two for off the belay then all bolts. A ton of draws needed\n\nP8 - 11a 140 ft. - Up the awkward corner, pass some loose flakes, and then pull into the fist crack groove. Up this until a bolt leads you onto the face out left. Up to another nice ledge. Many bolts and gear\n\nP9 - 10d 150 ft. - Sting in the tail for sure. Up and left on cruxy slab (bolts) to get established below a corner. Work your way into it and up it passing a few bolts and lots of gear options.\n\nP10 - 5.8/4th 200 ft. - Step left and then head up the slab. There is an anchor on the right wall to bring up your second. Then it's easy to solo up and left then back right to the glorious topout.","protection":"Maybe 15 draws.

Though you'll have to link some to do it in 10 pitches and have 5.10 on every pitch. This is a great route of mostly face climbing (\"Cara\") that can be climbed with nothing but draws. The bottom half is some truly incredible and unique rock (\"Perfecta\"). The top half is a little bushier and grainier, but great all the same. The bolt spacing is generally quite friendly. Though to be expected for a route like this and one put up by these guys, it's not exaaactly a sport route. Additionally, if you end up in a situation where you can't climb out, you'd be pretty screwed.\n\nAs this is a bluff, you'll walk to the top of the route, rap down and then star the climb. To begin, you rap a route to the left at first (\"the face that launched a 1000 clips\") and then start rappelling Ten at the top of the 4th pitch. If you manage to find the top and rappel down, route-finding is easy as you just follow the line of bolts. The rappel route is mostly straight down, angling right at times.\n\nP1 - Up the easy corner until you can clip the first bolt out right. A couple bolts of hard slab (some of the hardest moves on the route imo) gains the amazing face covered in little crimps all the way tot he anchor.\n\nP2 - Continue up the face to a belay below the short headwall. Can link with 3\n\nP3 - Up the steep headwall until you can step right. Crux traverse right then go up and gain a ramp that takes you up and left to a belay. Shorter pitch.\n\nP4 - Walk left on the ledge and then head up the glassy face passing a couple bolts. Gain the corner and step left, guided by bolts, when reasonable. Up to the anchor, climbing through amazing dikes.\n\nP5 - Gain a grassy tips crack with bolts that goes over a roof or two and stop at an anchor on a ledge or keep going to a second anchor on a huge grassy ledge.\n\nP6 - If you stopped at the lower anchor, head up a short but dirty corner that puts you on the huge grassy ledge. Walk way right clipping the other anchor on the way. Clip a bolt, mantel and gain a ledge by a tree and another anchor. (can be linked with 7 if you belayed at the higher anchor)\n\nP7 - Continue straight up the face eventually passing a tree until an anchor on a rampy ledge.\n\nP8 - Head up the steep knobby face. Traverse left a short ways then back right along a really cool dike. Anchor at a stance, can link with the next one with a 70 and long slings.\n\nP9 - Head up past some frictiony moves until some easy ground is reached. Stop at the first anchor if you linked or the higher one 20 ft. above if not.\n\nP10 - An interesting one. Head straight up to the roof and bushes. Clip a reachy bolt and then pull a tough mantel using the manzanita. Continue to a tree and anchor or link with the next one.\n\nP11 - A bolted and steep fist crack. A #3 or 4 might be nice on this section depending on your comfort level. It's pretty secure. So it's up to you. Above, tricky arete moves lead to some bushy climbing and an anchor at a ledge.\n\nP12 -14 - Can apparently be wet in the  early season. Traverse right then up some tricky lieback and mantel moves. 12 and 13 can be linked. 14 is easy up and left to the top.\n\nP12 alternative - 5.11b, last pitch of Face...1000 clips - Move the belay up and left to a big ledge that you rappelled past on the approach. Super thin moves off the ground (bolt) gain some good holds. Head left, then up to a wheat thin style flake. At its top, traverse right then up on amazing knobs. P13 - easy to the top. Highly recommended.","protection":"15 or so draws, half extendable. 1x #3 and 1x #4 cams are useful on p11.

The top of the route/start of the rappel approach is on the far right side of the cliff.

Make your way to the edge of the cliff and look for the gigantic cairn that marks the start in a nice open area. You should be able to see the Balch Camp flake from the top.
