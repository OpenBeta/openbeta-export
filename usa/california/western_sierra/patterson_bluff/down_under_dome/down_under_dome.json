Tiny to medium offset nuts and a few small cams (offset purple/blue metolius is nice to have for the crux), black and blue totems or blue and purple metolius cams are helpful. Bring a nut tool to clean up placements, as they can get filled with dirt during the winter.\n\nP2) Clip a bolt and enjoy nice crimps towards the roof. You can try and fiddle a small cam below the roof, or stand up and clip a bolt directly above the lip. Pull over and climb a ways to clip the 3rd bolt, after which the difficulties drop down and you run it out to the anchor.","protection":"Bolts, tiny cams and tiny to medium nuts.
