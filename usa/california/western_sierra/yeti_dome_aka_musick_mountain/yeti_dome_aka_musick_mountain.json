Crimpy edges start you off climbing either side of the arete till you can climb out left to a small shelf that affords a great rest.  Climb back out right to the arete and up some powerful moves through the crux and up to some easier 5.10 terrain.","protection":"7 QD's","location":"The route is located on the far southern shoulder of Yeti dome which is actually located on the Southeastern side of Musick Mountain.  Follow the dirt road from the Big Creek turnoff to the lookout tower/repeater station then follow the rounded ridge down to the cliffs.  The base of the route requires scrambling down a slab a little bit to approach.  It is easy to scramble up and around to the top of the route to set a TR off bolts as well."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,a5ac4815-eeb0-59ad-8b20-08b5ff151027,42635252-ba6d-5dfb-8345-2f6870787966","pathTokens":["USA","California","Western Sierra","Yeti Dome (aka Musick Mountain)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.3094,37.1667]},"bbox":[-119.30996427507256,37.16625033981814,-119.3088357249274,37.16714966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105817198","area_id":"QmNSUrptXfuDRS9ocHh5Zg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.30996427507256,37.16625033981814],[-119.3088357249274,37.16625033981814],[-119.3088357249274,37.16714966018187],[-119.30996427507256,37.16714966018187],[-119.30996427507256,37.16625033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:32.768Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:05.880Z"}
