The first half of this very short jaunt ascends clean, white granite revealed after Shaver lake was drained in 2011. The second half is home to lichen. The rock is crisp underfoot, keep your feet clean. Don't put cams between the rock and fragile portions of the flake, common sense. Sling the the aluminum can 2/3 of the way up for bomber pro! The crux is working the left foot up on smears and small edges. There are good jams for the right hand and foot. Swim move with the left hand. This felt like about 5.8 for me. Good fun on an aesthetic boulder. I wish it were longer...you will too. Would probably make a good high-ball or free-solo. The adjacency to the road and ease of access may make this a good quick fix for those traveling past Shaver Lake, or a fun place to introduce someone to climbing or take the kids for a short outing. Top-ropeable face climbs likely exist on the face left of the crack. Lapping and down-climbing practice are the names of the games here.","protection":"cams from BD 0.75 to BD 3\n\ntop takes BD #2 to #4 to set up a TR anchor","location":"The prominent, left-leaning crack on Rise Again Rock"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,a5ac4815-eeb0-59ad-8b20-08b5ff151027,2cd3838c-2a5a-55ea-a7e2-5719c353518d,fc21aa52-acda-562f-9822-38187303d80b","pathTokens":["USA","California","Western Sierra","Shaver Lake Bouldering","Rise Again Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.30122,37.14955]},"bbox":[-119.30178414707866,37.14910033981814,-119.30065585292134,37.14999966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110142175","area_id":"/CGqUqzaVi+YIjgYcwPYCw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.30178414707866,37.14910033981814],[-119.30065585292134,37.14910033981814],[-119.30065585292134,37.14999966018186],[-119.30178414707866,37.14999966018186],[-119.30178414707866,37.14910033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:33.217Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:07.082Z"}
