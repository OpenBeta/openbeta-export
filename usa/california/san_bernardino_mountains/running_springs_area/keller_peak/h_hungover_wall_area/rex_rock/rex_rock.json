Once past the crux the difficulty eases and it's no harder than 5.11 to the top.\n\nA decent route but it's a brief crux, the rock is not the best and it's sorely lacking in continuity which merits it a star at best.","protection":"4 bolts, 2 bolt anchor/rap","location":"Just off the road on the west side of the formation.
