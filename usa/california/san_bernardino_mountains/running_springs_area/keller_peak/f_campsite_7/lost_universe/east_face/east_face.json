Climb the large block and clip the first bolt.  Thin moves and some smearing get you past the second bolt (the crux), to the start of a hand crack.  Using the arete and the crack, move past four more bolts to the top of the pinnacle.  Perhaps much harder if you try to stay on the arete proper, but the holds tend to lead one to the crack, actually the finish of Lost in Space which originates on the South Face of Lost Universe.  Fun and interesting climbing on excellent rock.  Rappel to descend.","protection":"6 bolts, bolted anchor","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,ee2401d2-45ce-57c1-8c4c-59350d8177d1,216c65c1-a383-55c6-aabf-38bbc439532d,216cca0b-c6b9-5568-99e8-54a9e1f8ac4d,bfea5fac-8a39-5412-a008-454b3cafbd6a,b0f4c388-817a-5624-ad2a-8d61493015c3,8b4dda85-412f-5324-a363-9ffddc4d9499","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Bernardino Mountains","Running Springs Area","Keller Peak","(f) Campsite 7","Lost Universe","East Face"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.06377,34.19453]},"bbox":[-117.06431363628573,34.194080339818136,-117.06322636371429,34.194979660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106033587","area_id":"i03ahUEvUySjY5/93E2UmQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:19.657Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:01.263Z"}
