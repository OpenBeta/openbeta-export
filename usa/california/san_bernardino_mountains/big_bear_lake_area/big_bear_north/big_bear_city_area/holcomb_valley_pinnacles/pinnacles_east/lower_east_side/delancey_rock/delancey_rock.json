The roof is not as intimidating as it may look and my friends and I all thought the route went at 5.8.  I think it has cleaned up a bit in the lower section, making the climb easier than on the first ascent.\n\nAs a variation, you can start on the same flake at the bottom, but follow the crack up to the anchor.  This is a very nice finger to hand crack that goes at about 5.8+ if you avoid using the block that leans into the main wall.
