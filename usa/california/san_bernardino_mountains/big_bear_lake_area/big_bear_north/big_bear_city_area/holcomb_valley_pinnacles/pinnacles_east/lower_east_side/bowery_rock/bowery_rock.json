Start on the slab above a large, flat rock.\n\nGoing straight up past the bolt, without using the right edge of the slab, yields a more challenging start at about 5.10a. Using the right edge, although more natural, downgrades this section to about 5.8. Continue up the middle section using side pulls and delicate footwork. Finish on the upper section with a crux on small crimps and careful balance.\n\nThe climb seems harder than it is due to the amount of lichen on the rock; a fun climb which should be real nice once it sees more traffic.

Use care while surmounting the top of the slab because the large upper plate is loose and could shift.  After clipping the first bolt, continue up the headwall.
