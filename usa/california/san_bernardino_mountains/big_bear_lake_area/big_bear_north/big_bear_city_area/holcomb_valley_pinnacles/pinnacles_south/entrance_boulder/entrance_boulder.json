Sink your fists deep into the crack and jam your way upward. Slightly overhanging in nature, the lower section of the crack is bomber. Continue up with the crack growing ever so slightly wider until the top section begs to spit you out. Plentiful holds on the face throughout can be utilized for substantially easier climbing. Extremely enjoyable climbing while unfortunately being rather short. The crack takes hands to fist-sized gear and larger pieces at the top. It is possible to scramble up the surrounding boulders to access the anchors for a top rope or to downclimb.","protection":"Large gear to 4\", 2 bolt anchor","location":"Located on the east face of the Entrance Boulder in a corridor, around the corner from Welcome to Pinnacles."},"__v":0},{"_id":"BOQjjQHfWfmAlhjll0nDew==","name":"Grimy Slimy","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Brad Singer, June 2005","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.87992,34.30455]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"111068273","mp_crag_id":"106520081","climb_id":"BOQjjQHfWfmAlhjll0nDew==","areaRef":"ypOBdZCIUL6xnc8W4qahTA=="},"content":{"description":"Climb a dirty, left-slanting finger crack then transition to a dirty, right-slanting hand crack and finish with a short section of face climbing past one bolt to anchors.
