Either clip the first bolt off the boulder near the start or clip it once on to the ramp. Climb the ramp up and left to a sloping ledge, clipping the second bolt along the way. From this point, cross over left and up to a jug, making difficult transition from the ledge to the main face by way of opposing small holds. Upon reaching the jug, clip bolt #3 and crank up onto the top of the jug. At this point, the terrain eases up as one clips bolts #4 and #5, moving up casual slab moves to anchors with rap rings.","protection":"(5) draws","location":"The start of this route is located on the southwestern side of Chester Rock, near the right side corner.

It is sustained, although it gets slightly easier the higher you get. The rock quality could be better and some holds might change their shape if this route sees more traffic.\n\nClip the first bolt from the big undercling, before you actually get on the wall. Getting situated on the wall is probably the crux. The holds are small and sharp. Once on the wall, get the second clip and pick the right sequence to get to slightly easier terrain about half way up the wall. To pass the third and fourth bolt good reach and high stepping are helpful.","protection":"4 bolts, rap anchors","location":"This route is on the east face of Chester Rock.
