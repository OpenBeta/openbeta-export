The crux is an awkward move to get established on the headwall.  Taller climbers will find this move quite easy.  Follow the dike up the right side of the wall.  A secondary crux is found transitioning from the dike to the upper wall.  This can be done either to the right or the left of the bolt.  Continue up the right side of the upper wall to chain anchors.  Rappel to descend.\n\nNote: the prominent middle block of the dike is very loose.  As this piece of rock is quite large, try to climb without using it and make sure your belayer wears a helmet.  Avoiding this block does not make the route more difficult, just more interesting.","protection":"6 bolts, bolted chain anchor","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"kBo5Bd2dXledBR3c7zH/ZA==","name":"Guys and Dolls","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Jeff Brown & Chris Miller, 2005","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.87949,34.31382]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106442337","mp_crag_id":"106442331","climb_id":"kBo5Bd2dXledBR3c7zH/ZA==","areaRef":"LVuCXdIKVNatrj4vLIJZvw=="},"content":{"description":"Start in the gully, clip the first bolt and get on the face to the left.
