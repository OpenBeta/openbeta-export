Continue on up with good crimps staying away from any grabs used for the rout to the right and to the left. 3/4s of the way up there is a solid jug to rest on. After this jug is the hardest part of the climb due to the small crimps after and the steepness being over 90 degrees which is where this climb gets its rating. After the jug there is a small pinch for the left hand and above the jug there is a small crimp for the right. You gotta get your right foot up and on top of the jug. Once you’ve done that it’s small crimps till the top! (Note: There are no quick links on the anchor to run your rope through to belay down! In order to get down and to set up top anchor you have to free solo the backside of the boulder on the left. You can also lead climb the left or right sport climbs on the face to set up the top rope)","protection":"Anchor set up at top for top rope.
