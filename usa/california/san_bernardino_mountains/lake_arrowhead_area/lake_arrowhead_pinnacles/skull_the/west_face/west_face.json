Pitch one (5.8) starts up a slabby face with some suspect rock to a high first bolt, head right for the 2nd just below the roof and make the crux move up and over to the 3rd bolt. From here medium to small cams can be used to protect the moves up a heavily featured face, either head right for an easier finish or climb directly up the face. Pitch two (5.9) begins off the block onto an overhanging roof (the crux). Slab climb past this to the summit.
