The route is visualized in three sections separated by two poor rests. Begin in the chimney and cut left with a big throw past the first bolt. Finagle your way through an undercling sequence (or muscle up directly if you are strong). V7 with the right beta or powerful V8 without. The second crux is the wild flying squirrel move: Launch off a right hand sidepull, catch your left in a wedge, then catch a hidden hold right around the bulge all in one dynamic lunge (V6). Taller/stronger folks might be able to static it. Cop a quick rest on jugs with no feet, then move left into the dihedral for the third, easier crux.\n\nThe route is short and stout; shorter but much more challenging than Redwood Burl and similar in difficulty to Thank You Thighmaster but with many more hard moves. The grade was confirmed as “13b or 13c” by Ethan Pringle on the second ascent. It’s a tough one to grade since you can make it super technical or super burly.","protection":"5 bolts (titanium), Ram's horns anchor.","location":"First route on your left as you enter the corridor, just before the log."},"__v":0},{"_id":"dyBz+ceqVz6IwsoWkyEahQ==","name":"Man The Cannons","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Matt Delheimer, 02/15","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.1051,41.6065]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"110126726","mp_crag_id":"109796971","climb_id":"dyBz+ceqVz6IwsoWkyEahQ==","areaRef":"6qkUZOs/WnCRfCqKXKzQbQ=="},"content":{"description":"Another short but good route on a slightly under-vertical wall.

Just like Moab's Crack House, touching the ground or the boulder behind you is cheating.\n\nThe best logistics are to have a belayer at the base of Gnarwhal and boulder out through the cave. Those newer to doing crack might want a pad and spotter. At the exit of the cave, clip into the third bolt of Gnarwhal and finish it up to the top.
