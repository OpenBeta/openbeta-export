I did not rebolt Holladay-Ludwig in its entirety because of sections of loose rock.\n\nThe crux was going direct at the fourth bolt with friction slab feet. I recently pulled off the big block with a crowbar and unfortunately it made going far right possible only about 5.6. Test yourself going direct, but you can always bail out right towards Holliday-Ludwig.\n\nA new 5th bolt protects the follower from a nasty swing. It’s super super comfy to skip it on lead, but it is there to protect your follower. Clip it with a sling or long draw.\n\nOh yeah, and you'll have to follow the climb to clean it!

Right next to one of the world's hardest cracks? This route is a destination line for anyone climbing mid 5.14.\n\nThree days of bolting, cleaning, and $250 of titanium revealed this climb to be much, much harder than I had bargained for and out of my league for more than one or two moves at a time (on a very good day). I bolted it solo using cam placements, multiple crazy directional ropes, and only one removable bolt. Yet there are no extra holes drilled on the route.\n\nThis unbelievable climb forks right from the fourth bolt of Doggy Style (5.13), hits a kneebar rest, and diagonals up and right following an insanely overhung line of pockets and underclings for a total of 11 bolts. The movement is absolutely top notch and insanely unique. The wall is STEEEEEP and relentless, with an incredible pump near the top.
