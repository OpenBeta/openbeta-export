A recent cleaning allowed the route to go on gear and is actually pretty neat. The moves are kind of wacky, and a bit complicated to protect well, but that all adds to the fun. It would be a popular top rope if it was cleaned up a bit. Pull over a bulge with a #2 at your feet and a difficult medium cam at your chest, pull up on a jug and place a micro-nut before pulling into the short crack.
