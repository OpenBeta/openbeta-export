Its history of being climbed is unknown and highly unlikely. I've been up it several times and once with a scrub brush. It is getting cleaner each time, but it still comes with a little dirt.\n\nOnce you work your way up and left past all of the ledges and boring flaky rock (5.5) you are rewarded with one of the best cracks in Humboldt County. After the last ledge, the enormous overhang looms above. From here on up, if you fall on top rope, you'll take a massive swing out into space and will not be making it back to the cliff; it is all or nothing.\n\nThe 50 foot overhang is strenuous and unrelenting offwidth using everything from fists, forearm jams, arm bars, and some welcome arm locks. You will pass several bulges, a few of them pretty sizable, and all of them providing an obstacle. Pass the larger roofs in the beginning with exciting chimney moves and good jams. After the bigger roofs, alternate between a jammed knee and stemming.\n\nBreathtaking amount of air all around you on this route!!","protection":"Edit: The gear anchor at the ledge halfway up is really not great, it's best best to climb as one pitch. If you do it in one pitch, don't place gear on the lower ramp and clip any gear at the upper ramp ~8' long or you would have impossible rope drag.\n\nGear:\n\ndoubles 3-7\"","location":"To access the top, find the trail that turns west off of the Rim Trail, at the first fork, turn right. Follow this overgrown trail up a hill, past some caves, and back downhill. Turn right and walk below a 20' rock and land on a grassy ledge on the just below the headwall on the southern side. Climb across a 3rd class crossing below the headwall. On your right (east) you will notice a fist crack and offwidth, these are directly above the route. Set an anchor in these or equalize the two larger trees with a separate climbing rope or your rope won't land in the correct spot. If leading, you will want to set up your anchor first so you donÂ’t have to climb over the dirt mound at the top."},"__v":0},{"_id":"hpygvdFqV/iBPZfBQD4Sbg==","name":"Mussels For Bones","yds":"5.12b","grades":{"yds":"5.12b","french":"7b"},"fa":"Ben Flores & Evan Wisheropp","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-124.1562,41.1384]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"110688600","mp_crag_id":"106300245","climb_id":"hpygvdFqV/iBPZfBQD4Sbg==","areaRef":"8bZpqvBgVBOF9YbcY1pjdg=="},"content":{"description":"Climb a VERY aesthetic 5.10+ section off the deck, that alternates between liebacking and sweet delicate face moves.\n\nThe crux (mentally and physically) is climbing an overhung block about halfway up the route.
