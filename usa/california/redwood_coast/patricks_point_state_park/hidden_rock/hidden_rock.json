After the short dihedral it meets up with the last bolt of Intimidation and tops out to a gear anchor of 1-2.\"\n\nThe route has exciting moves the entire way and pretty good gear--although still uncomfortably runnout in sections. It starts at a short dyno or long reach (can be skipped by stepping off the boulder), followed by a mantle out left and then a hand traverse right. The first crux is more mental than physical; move up into the roof after the traverse where you are now in ground fall zone with a back breaking pyramid rock below you (5.9 R+).\n\nAfter learning more history on the area from Frank Jager, the name was decided as a tribute to his many other routes in the area. Also, because if you fall off the first crux, you'll bomb straight onto the backbreaker on the deck.
