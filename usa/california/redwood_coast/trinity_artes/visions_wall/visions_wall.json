The route is primarily a sport climb but has some crucial gear between the 4th and 5th bolts.\n\nStart the route by crimping past 4 bolts to a good rest (5.10). The first part of the route is just steep enough to be interesting but the overhanging fun begins after placing a #2 and 3 camalot in the right leaning, juggy crack. Take your time to place good gear as a fall from just below the next bolt could result in a deck fall without the gear. After placing your pieces and grabbing a rest in the \"pod\", launch up the arete and face just to the right. Around the 8th bolt, either stay on the arete for the full value 5.12 version or climb about 3 feet to the right for the 11d. At the last bolt, move back left as the arete ends at an 18\" ledge with a three bolt anchor.
