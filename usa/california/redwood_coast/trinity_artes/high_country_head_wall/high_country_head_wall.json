This route leads to the highest point on the cliff via an arete that offers more exposure than any other line at the crag. The climbing itself is not particularly fascinating but the views, exposure, and excitement make this climb worthwhile.\n\nStarts at the far right of Paisano Buttress on the 5.9 to the right of Cromagnon Man. After a couple bolts, hang a hard left and proceed with the thoughtful traverse above the anchors for Cro', Smoke Signals, etc, placing gear between the bolts. Belay from the Burnt Offering II / Deepthroat anchors. A 70m rope just BARELY makes it to the rap anchors just left of the If anchors.","protection":"Bolts with interspersed gear placements.

Clip the 420 shadow anchor and add gear if needed to reach the anchor above If. extended alpine draws are useful to mitigate rope drag.\n\np2: climb up for 2 close bolts and then through a dirty gully to your left. Add pro here or Run-out until you find your 3rd bolt. The rest of the pitch is bolted on fun climbing through a dihedral up to a dead tree with a chain next to it.\n\np3: The exposed diagonal crack leading up and right. Find placements and feet and maneuver up the exposed and proclaim your manhood at the top.\n\ndescent: walk off OR a full 70m rope will JUST reach the 1st pitch anchors or the anchors above If.
