The anchors are set high above the ledges to reduce friction while pulling ropes; a PAS won’t be long enough, so you’ll need to clove hitch into the anchor, trad-dad style. The name is because the FA of this route included an extremely elaborate, and successful marriage proposal!\n\nP1. (5.10a) After a small roof enjoy steep slab with good scoops. Belay on a large grassy ledge. Extend the anchor 20’ if you plan on top roping (or hammer in two bolts in the empty holes I left at the top of the pitch). 85’ 9 bolts.\n\nP2.

(5.10a) Another vertical start gives way to a slab with an exciting no hands traverse left across a good foot rail. The crux is the last 30’ where the wall steepens, but is thankfully featured with great holds. Belay on large grassy ledge. 115’ 12 bolts\n\nP5. (5.10b) Obtuse dihedral to an awesome roof with insane cave huecos. Belay on a small ledge. 70’ 9 bolts\n\nP6. (5.10c) Continue up the slab then clip the bolt above the ledge with a stiffy draw or place a #2 cam instead. Crank on pockets up and left onto the tip of the summit prow. You could cheat out right, but you'd be a bit runnout and would rob yourself of an exciting finish! 60’ 7 bolts.\n\nDescend by making five rappels.
