The route climbs a separate boulder for two bolts before stepping across to the main rock. From there, the bolts trend left as you traverse left. They are spaced close enough to keep you off of the ledge out right should you whippersnappers pitch off. Be sure to clip bolt #3-5 slings to keep your rope running smooth. The anchors were installed by Zach Miller with the intent to inspect the roof. The rest of this route was bolted with his welcoming go-ahead.","protection":"9 bolts. I clipped bolt 2 and 5 medium length, and 3 and 4 with shoulder length slings to keep the rope from pinching under the mini-roof","location":"Halfway between Russian Roulette and All Marked Up.

The name I'm guessing is alluding to how discovering which foot holds are going to blow is like playing a game of Russian Roulette. The two main cruxes come in the upper half of the cave. I might recommend clipping the bolts in the cave with slings to keep the rope running free from rubbing too hard on the not-so-smooth rock at the lip of the cave.\n\nParts of the cave were wet, but would likely be better later in the season. A note on the grade, pg. 40 of the Bigfoot guide lists it as 13c and pg. 42 lists it as 13b. Whatever the grade, it's an incredible route and quite a bit of work, it should only clean up with more traffic.","protection":"14 bolts","location":"The drawing in the Bigfoot Guide is a little misleading, the route is much farther left than it would lead you to believe.
