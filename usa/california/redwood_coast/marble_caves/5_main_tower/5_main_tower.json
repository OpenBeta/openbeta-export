In fact, it is the longest single pitch on the Redwood Coast [edit: that honor now belonging to Love and War]. Warm up with a relaxing slab on the far left side of the wall before launching into the endless headwall. The 20’ crux comes just above a small ledge and has three closely spaced fixed draws for safety. Once pulling onto the crux, two big crosses land a hidden right hand fingerlock to clip the second fixed draw. A few feet of laybacking lead to the third fixed draw where you will set your feet and reach high for a mega-jug. This mega-jug makes a much-needed seated rest before starting the 5.10+ marathon to the top. A small ledge at the anchor makes belaying your partner comfortable while they haul a second rope.\n\nIf a hold feels sharp or uncomfortable, there is always a better one nearby\n\n! Don't miss this one, you and your partner are sure to have a good time!","protection":"21 bolts, (3 are fixed draws), and 2 bolt rap anchor.\n\nPay attention to the rope path on the lower half and use plenty of slings (12” and 24\") to prevent rope drag.

With 4-5 slings in the right place, and at least six 12\" draws (folded over sling), the rope runs 100% smooth to the top!","location":"Far left side of the Main Tower, at the base of an easy slab.

Once out of view of your belayer, you can rest on a short section of 5.7 before starting up a long and lonely 5.11- headwall (very well protected).

The catch though is, finding that hidden hold on the onsight is damn hard!\n\nIf for whatever reason you need to bail, you can fix your line to a bolt, rap the line, then scramble up around the back with another rope and rap down from the summit off a bolted anchor. But, the bolts are close enough together you should be able to bumble your way up it with a stiffy draw.\n\nFive slings are adequate to eliminate rope drag, though you'll appreciate using a lightweight rope!
