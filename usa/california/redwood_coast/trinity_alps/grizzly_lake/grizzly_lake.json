Please comment!\n\nStart at the far end of Grizzly Lake. Ascend easy snow up the NW Ridge to Caesar Peak summit, some easy scrambling. Head down west from the summit on the ridge, eventually crossing it a bit before the low point headed south to traverse some more and reach the base of Thompson's E Face. Climb wandery and rambly but good, solid rock I remember finding some very interesting horn-like granite patina... many options exist. Walkoff NW from summit to easy snow slopes back to the lake.","protection":"Standard rock pro","location":"Grizzly Lake"},"__v":0},{"_id":"6irHJM82WeaHqmUeB+0xhQ==","name":"Grizzly Crack","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Lianna Winkler-Prins & Ian Pierce 9/1/12","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.0493,41.0097]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107778000","mp_crag_id":"107777997","climb_id":"6irHJM82WeaHqmUeB+0xhQ==","areaRef":"JBUchTApX9+Y0xoAVvV4oA=="},"content":{"description":"From the base of the Grizzly Lake scramble, follow the right(west) side of the creek up as far as you can.\n\nIt starts off as easy 4th/5th class and soon becomes ~5.6 lower angle slab. We were ~15' to the right of the waterfall this entire pitch (P1) Once this becomes steep (and at a break in the slope), start to head to the right towards a fairly obvious block with 2 cracks on it. (P2) After climbing over a lot of choss, reach a fairly clean vertical off width.(P3, 5.10, ~80')There is a left crack also, but we followed the right vertical one. We had to french free a few moves on this section. Go up, over, and then scramble over some boulders to the left for the next pitch. From here climb around the big rock and enter a squeeze chimney (5.9+) and then a second squeeze chimney. (P4) After this there is an easy but chossy scramble to the lake (P5). Walk off.\n\nPitches 3+4 are good and will be great if cleaned up some more. The view of the waterfall and the valley below are awesome for the entire climb.","protection":"Single rack, .2-#5.
