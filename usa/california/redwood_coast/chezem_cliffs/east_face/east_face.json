With two bolts to a comfy anchor, the climber will find comfortable stances every time theyâ€™re clipping in.\n\nAn awkward start puts you straight into a jug ladder and through some nice little ledges. The 5.6 crux is right after the first bolt as you pull through the bulge on finicky feet and mini jugs.\n\nBe sure to find the buckets for side pulls!\n\nRedirect your rope for a nice (5.6) variation, juggy top rope straight up the middle of the East Face that substitutes awkward pulls through bulges for slabby, balanced steps.","protection":"2 bolts\n\nTwo stainless steel hangers with rap rings for the anchor","location":"The leftmost sport route on the East Face wall.
