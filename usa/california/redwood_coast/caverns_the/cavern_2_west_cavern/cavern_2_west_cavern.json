Likely one of the steepest 5.11c routes in Humboldt/Trinity. At bolt #2 the angle steepens impressively and jugs appear.

It was a pain to clip our draws over them, so we removed them. If you are heading out there and feel like replacing them, or pitching in for some chain, let me know.","protection":"7 bolts.
