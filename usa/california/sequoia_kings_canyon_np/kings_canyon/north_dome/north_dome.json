Would be way more classic if not for all the mandatory bush climbing. 2 crux pitches, both are really good. Infamous for OW, it aint that bad, but do expect some burly chimneys. Refer to nettle topo. I think he overestimated a lot of pitch lengths, though most pitches are still pretty long. Not a single bolt or fixed piece on the route\n\nP1 - 5.10 200' - we took the crack/groove on the left, right might be easier. After this, climb left of the dirty chimney. Easier climbing leads to a nice alcove\n\nP2 - 5.9 200+' - Crack system on the right is what you want. Steep layback to hands to fingers on cool rock. Enter and climb an intimidating chimney with a wild exit move. Continue up to a tree. We broke this pitch up in two, stopping after the chimney on a nice ledge and then did a short one to the tree.\n\nP3 - 5.10+ 150' - Varied climbing in the corner leads to a short OW crux. Belay in a little alcove with a tiny foot rail.\n\nP4 - 5.10+ 180' - Hands lead out of the alcove to the roof. Super unique granite 3-D climbing leads out the roof to a little thin hands crux. easy climbing takes you to a bush ledge belay\n\nP5 - 5.9 150' - Romp up in and around some bushes to a really nice stance/ledge.\n\nP6 - 5.10 150' - Step left to get back in the corner system and layback around a sweet flake feature. Get up to the last good stance, nest some gear and make a tricky move up and left to gain some good holds. Get in some more gear and bust the crux out left. I was able to climb up a bit and get in some pro under a big flake thing to protect my follower. Stop wherever is comfortable.\n\nP7 - 5.9 \"bush chimney\" 150' - indeed. belay on giant ledge\n\nP8 - 5.9 150' - It for sure looks improbable, but go climb near the only rock that looks anything like some orange knobs. Good gear and holds become available. Pass the big tree on the left and stop wherever comfortable.\n\nP9 - 5.7 200' - topo didn't really make sense to us here. From where we belayed, we traversed straight left on some broken rock and then romped it up to the top.","protection":"Some small nuts were nice for P6. 1 set tiny->fingers. 2 sets to #3. 1 #4,5, & 6. #6 might not be necessary but was definitely nice in a few spots.
