Approach from the road and scramble up right around the gated-off entrance to a small cave visible from the road. 5-10 minutes to the base of the climb.\n\nThe route is almost entirely 4th and easy 5th class climbing, with no offensive boring sections. While the rock looks blocky and broken from below, it is actually quite solid marble with some fun short jamcracks and plentiful face holds. The biggest detractor is the sheer amount of yucca plants that grow along its length - expect to find technical cruxes stemming out around and avoiding the many spines, and plan to shed some blood along the way. I felt like I had been violated by a dirty, unlicensed acupuncturist after climbing this route... Easy walk off down the gully to the right.","protection":"A light rack to 2 or 3\" if planning to rope up.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,714cb3f2-1cf4-5285-9f5e-1965c8e4a540,b95efcfe-12d8-5f88-bbd3-a3d6710ec3ea,3194a960-3574-52f8-a15d-eb0ac649407e","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","Kings Canyon","Boyden/ Windy Cliff Area","Windy Cliff"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.81944,36.81751]},"bbox":[-118.82000169028153,36.81706033981814,-118.81887830971844,36.81795966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114964204","area_id":"MZSpYDV0UvihXesKxklAfg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.82000169028153,36.81706033981814],[-118.81887830971844,36.81706033981814],[-118.81887830971844,36.81795966018186],[-118.82000169028153,36.81795966018186],[-118.82000169028153,36.81706033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:33.575Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:39.593Z"}
