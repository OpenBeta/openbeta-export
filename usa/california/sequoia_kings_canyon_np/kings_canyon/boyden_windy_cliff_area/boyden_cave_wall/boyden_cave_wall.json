Yup. Its good, too. Sharp limestone-like face climbing that will destroy your fingertips.\n\nSome info here -\n\npublications.americanalpineâ€¦\n\nShort 30 minute approach from Boyden Cavern parking. Hike the paved trail towards the Cavern and follow an old trail at the first switchback. Head up the gully (water in early season) and cross 4th class slabs to reach the base. Look for the orange bolt hanger that marks the start of the route. Mind the poison oak on the approach - there is loads of it.","protection":"1x set cams from blue alien to #3, 2X 0.5-1 camalots, at least 12 draws/extendable slings. 2X 60M ropes to rappel.
