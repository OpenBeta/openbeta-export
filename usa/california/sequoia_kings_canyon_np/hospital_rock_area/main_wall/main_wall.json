Lunch Bucket Ledge is a route towards the left side of the Hospital Rock \"Main Wall\", the largest visible formation, north of the Hospital Rock parking lot.\n\nThe first pitch passes two bolts. You can either belay on the first ledge and break up the first pitch into two pitches, or climb past the anchor and up to the bigger ledge.  Many variations past this first two bolt anchor (I prefer the face/cracks to the left).\n\nPitch two (or three) climbs the green left facing corner, and is best rapped with two ropes.\n\nChains for rapping are on each belay (3 belays total).","protection":"Standard rack, bolted belays, rap ring descent.\n\n70m rope or two 60m.","location":"The route can best be reached by parking at the turnoff about a half mile further up the highway from Hospital Rock and trudging directly up the hill. Or, buschwack from the parking lot. Appropriate attire is highly recommended, or you'll be spending half your day picking stickers off."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,0d360410-7ac9-58db-a123-bf486a29a7cb,536f4221-51ce-5e4d-bb4b-25a1ff25d32a","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","Hospital Rock Area","Main Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.77366,36.52342]},"bbox":[-118.77421954771114,36.522970339818144,-118.77310045228889,36.52386966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109980861","area_id":"U29CIVHOXk27SyWh/yXTKg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.77421954771114,36.522970339818144],[-118.77310045228889,36.522970339818144],[-118.77310045228889,36.52386966018187],[-118.77421954771114,36.52386966018187],[-118.77421954771114,36.522970339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:18.954Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:21.929Z"}
