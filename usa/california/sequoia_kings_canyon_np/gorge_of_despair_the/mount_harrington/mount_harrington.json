Harrington via it's North Ridge on the way in or out. For any skilled rock climber this route is a short, exciting solo. Guidebooks give the climb a grade of class III, I would say that it is certainly class IV.\n\nThe summit is spectacular. From the top of Harrington the west ridge of The Monarch Divide, called Junction Ridge, drops about 9000 feet in 9 miles to Yucca Point where the South Fork of The Kings River joins with The Middle Fork.","protection":"The 4th class rating is pretty stiff. A fun easy solo for an experienced climber, the route is very exposed and an inexperienced person might like a rope. The featured rock offers plentiful opportunities for protection and anchors.","location":"Follow the approach as described on the Gorge of Despair page. From near the crest of Harrington Pass head left to get on the ridge.\n\nHere Guy Keesee is approaching Harrington Pass under the\n\neast Face of Mt. Harrington. The right skyline is the North Ridge route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,62b478a4-dbc3-5609-a06e-3750489fbe58,4ee00da6-b8aa-51be-99d5-fb8eb3199d51","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","Gorge of Despair, The","Mount Harrington"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.73371,36.87005]},"bbox":[-118.73427207634829,36.86960033981814,-118.73314792365171,36.87049966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114964357","area_id":"TuANpriqUb6Z1fuOsxmdUQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:18.950Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:40:49.548Z"}
