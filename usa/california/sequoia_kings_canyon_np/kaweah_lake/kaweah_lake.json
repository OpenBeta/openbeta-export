The top-rope wall contains several variations that can be easier or harder than 5.8, it is not one particular route. There are now several new bolted anchors at the top that are much prettier, and less completely corroded than the old ones. The base of the climb is sandy so be sure to bring a rope tarp, or somethin'. In early season the wall can be under water, which tends to make climbing it a bit harder than usual.","protection":"4 bolted anchors(now chopped). Bring gear to set up anchors.","location":"If leaving from Visalia, head east on the 198 until you get to the lake. Take the second boat offramp exit and take the dirt road to the right(east)that branches off near the end of the boat off ramp. Follow this road and it's many variations east until you're along side the wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,5daf24c9-9113-58c3-bae3-992d05f205ba","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","Kaweah Lake"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.86411,36.48966]},"bbox":[-118.86466930374206,36.48921033981813,-118.86355069625795,36.49010966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108501479","area_id":"Xa8kyZETWMO645ktBfIFug=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:15.504Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:06.519Z"}
