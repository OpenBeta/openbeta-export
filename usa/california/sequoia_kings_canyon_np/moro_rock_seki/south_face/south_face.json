For those who want to experience the beauty of such a gem, there's a little work to be done. And I'm sure back in 1939, patience and a bunch of bushwacking was part of that work load. Today, a fairly well marked climbers trail descends the East Gully to reach the base of the South Face and many other routes established on the east face. Adventure is the theme and the payoff......Moro Oro!\n\nPitch #1:\n\nSome feel the first pitch is the crux pitch. It is one of the highlight pitches of South Face. Start by leaving the belay by following a slanting crack up and to the right, passing a tree that is in the same crack. Once past the tree, move out right and then up onto the face. Climb past a detached flake and up to a small footledge with good pro nearby (small to medium nuts or cams). Continue up and slightly left to an obvious hand crack (pro to #2 Camelot). Climb this crack (5.8-) for 40 feet, which eventually eases up and ends at a triangle shaped corner with a nice flat ledge. Belay here.\n\nPitch #2:\n\nFrom the triangle ledge. head straight up a left facing corner. The first gear placement is 15 feet off the belay but the climbing is superb (5.6). It may appear harder at first but the holds show up when you need them. A combination of stemming, friction and crack climbing is the right combination to lead to the top of the corner, which has a flat ledge. Continue above this ledge on open slab. Although runout, the climbing gets no harder than 5.6. Trend up and right toward a large boulder. Belay at the boulder (large gear...#1 and bigger).\n\nPitch #3:\n\nThis is truly a thankless pitch but a short one, which tops out on Big Ledge (be extra careful there....many pointed cactus!). From the boulder, move out right for 30 feet and then around the corner and up left. Locate clear ledges and rock outcroppings. Traverse back left and head toward a clearing on the left. Belay in the clearing to reduce rope drag.\n\nPitch #4:\n\nOne may opt to move the belay higher or belay here. The recommendation and better choice to prevent rope drag, unrope here and locate boulder with a roof over it's top. Climb this boulder (a few V0- moves) to its top and pass underneath the roof. If wearing a pack, it presents an awkward and ungraceful top out. Once on top, locate a 10 foot chimney. Scramble the chimney (low 5th) to another small clearing. Rope up again to finish the remaining 70 feet, by climbing a series of slabs and ledges. Head toward the base of a green lichen streaked wall. Belay at a slanting ledge.\n\nPitch #5:\n\nThe Glory Pitch!! Certainly another highlight to the South Face route. From the slanting ledge, climb out to the left for 10 feet and then slightly up and right on knobs (some tieoffs) but easy and enjoyable climbing (5.6). Head upward to where the roof on the face above comes to a point above the knobs (good gear, pro to 1/2\"). As the climbing steeps, climb just past the \"point\" and move out left. Exposed and exhilarating climbing on knobs (5.7+)!! A finger crack provides ample protection. Continue up and above to the left until the crack peters out. Make an exposed move out toward two large crack/chimney systems. Upon reaching the crack/chimney system, move to the left most crack and up into the crack 25 feet further. Locate a one person ledge on the right and belay from here. ([u]Caution[/u]: this is a full rope length pitch...200 feet plus! Take care in protecting those that follow with an adequate supply of slings.)\n\nPitch #6:\n\nThis is a short pitch (90'). Continue up the crack/chimney system, passing a chockstone along the way. Upon surmounting the chockstone (5.6), move up and right to a nice ledge. Locate the only 2 bolts of the route on this ledge. Belay here.\n\nPitch #7:\n\nGet ready to have fun! This is a slightly runout slab section (2 lead bolts and small cams) but provides amazing views of the great Western Divide and the Castle Rock area. Climb directly above the belay bolts, passing two new bolts on sustained 5.6/5.7 slab. Additionally, there are pro opportunities about 50 feet off the belay (3/8\" Alien) in a thin left slanting crack. Above the slab are two possible ways to go. One may opt to move up right onto a wild and exposed knob covered face (5.9) and head straight up. Or head up and left, climbing a left facing corner. The pro is small but the holds are there. Should you choose to do the later of the two choices, climb this left slanting corner up for 60 feet to where a crack appears on the right, which continues up and right. Belay here at the intersection of the corner and the crack.\n\nPitch #8:\n\nClimb the crack that leads right and continues till in becomes a slanting ledge that ends at chimney. Climb the holds on the outside of chimney to a larger ledge up and to the right. Low 5th class. Once at the ledge, the remaining section of the South Face become 3rd class (600 ft). Top out on the tourist observation deck on top of Moro Rock.","protection":"A standard rack, emphasis on Aliens and nuts. Larger gear helpful at belays and on Pitches #1 and #5. Slings and pro to #3.

The climbing is fun and engaging. A nice treat for chimney fans. It is sustained at 5.8-5.10, though a few bits of aid can keep it a little more mellow.\n\nBumping cams or leap-frogging cams is sometimes an option. It’s a good size chimney, sometimes squeeze like to get pro in. It takes the big stuff so if you wanna sew it up like we did, two 5’s, 6’s and one 9 will get used.\n\nP1: 90’ 5.10a. From far right side of Jungle Ledge, climb dirty blocks to get into the chimney. Head up to some chock stones and a small, tight ledge. Careful not to kick the chocks down the chasm. Belay takes a #5 cam and #11 hex.\n\nP2: 150’ 5.10b/C1. Four star pitch. Up from the chocked ledge, where amazing feet edges keep coming, gets steep and tight to place pro. The 5’s, 6’s and the 9 work well here. Commit to a memorable and airy run up and out of the chimney to knobs, some med. pro at a crack. To a spacious ledge. Fun!\n\nP3: 100’ 5.10b/C1. From the spacious ledge, it’s thin, balanced moves off the deck with a wide 3,4” crack. Dirty and awkward up to another hard bit at chocks, then a dirty gully past trees to a belay under the oak trees.\n\n*From here the original route goes right to a slab then traverse, above the climb Slowburn, and under a roof bulge. Then a second pitch up an oak filled gully. We chose a straight up variation that is one pitch and probably a better option.\n\nP4: 210’ 5.9. Straight up in a wide crack to knobs, a traverse out right on knobs to a cool arete, then slab. Knob tie offs at the arete and before the slab run. Step over a gully and up the easy slab to a big ledge. Another fun pitch.\n\n500’+ of 3rd class to the summit.","protection":"A standard alpine rack with doubles in the medium and big stuff plus stoppers and slings.\n\nA 70m rope is suggested to do it in 4P’s.

It’s 60’ down the Sugar Pine trail then down hill past the giant fallen trees. 45-70 mins for the approach. Do the first two pitches of S. Face or climb South Cracks to Jungle Ledge.
