That other part, about the lichen, is also accurate. Like a smaller moratorium and would be of equal quality if clean\n\nP1 - 11b - Pull a move to get off the ground and enjoy clean 10a corner climbing up to the first roof. It would be burly enough without all the lichen, but, as it is, expect a full on battle and your belayer to get showered.\n\nCatch a rest and then summon the courage and beta to get around the second roof. Continue up through another crux and then some choss. I belayed on a sloping shelf with an odd bolt at my feet. Crazy pitch.. All the important feet are clean for the time being..\n\nP2 - 10c - Crank off the super clean and sharp locks in the corner and layback out the roof to a thank god foot ledge. Continue up the easier corner, clean and classic, to an ok belay below the small roof of the next pitch\n\nP3 - 10b - Climb the splitter on the left wall and work your way up and over the roof to a stance. A short ways higher we traversed left at a ledge and belayed at a bolted anchor. Continuing straight up did not seem like an option\n\nP4 - runout choss - You can rap from the anchor as there's another one straight down.. not sure if 1 or 2 ropes though. If you want to top out.. we took a line to the left up a vedged v-slot. There are some better looking lines, but it's pretty steep over there.","protection":"Double to #3. Extra .4-.75.

Let me know if you know the real name, who did the FA, or if you lead it and get a better idea of the difficulty.  I just felt like adding the furthest left (Spine Line) and furthest right (this one) climbs to start.\n\nThis climb has a variety of starts and climbs into a beautiful, clean corner with a finger crack, finishing with an easier corner and some knobs high up.  The first and last pitches are relatively easy, while the second pitch has a difficult bolt protected crux where the corner closes off and turns into a roof.\n\nP1:  This pitch climbs past the small pine tree, up large blocks and to a three bolt anchor at the start of the corner.  Choose any variation, including a traverse in from the east or ascending a number of ways from below.\n\nP2:  Climb the corner to the roof, pulling this roof if the crux and leads to another two bolt anchor.  There's a bolt under it but a larger cam fits above the bolt under the roof.  A clean corner, delicate slab, and a wild move over the left side of the roof makes this pitch an exciting one!\n\nP3:  From the bolts make your way up the left-facing corners and onto to the knobby face beyond.\n\nP3 Variation:  Climb up easy but runout knobs above the belay, slinging them as you go.","protection":"Cams up to 3\", a set of nuts, and some runners to avoid rope drag over the roof.
