Although overgrown, it's a fun setting. We were able to do it in a single pitch with a 70m, would probably have to simul or do two pitches with anything less.\n\nEasy walk-offs to either side, I always go down the slabs on the climber's left.","protection":"Standard Rack, pretty much eats up whatever you want to throw at it.","location":"Head south down Stony Creek past the intersection of it and Woodward Creek. The route is the obvious left facing dihedral on the east side of the creek.
