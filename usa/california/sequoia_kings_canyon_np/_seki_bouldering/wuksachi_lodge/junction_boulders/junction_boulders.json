Work your way up past some slopey knobs to gain the finger crack and work up to a very easy top out. Don't touch the jug out right!\n\nDownclimb by bellying over the lip until your foot finds the aforementioned jug. A pad is nice for the downclimb, but it isn't too hard.","protection":"A bigger pad or a couple smaller ones.","location":"As you are leaving Wuksachi Lodge, about 100 yards before the junction with Generals Highway, look downhill on your left for the biggest boulder. It is down by General's Highway and might not be visible in Spring and summer when the foliage is in.\n\nAlternatively, walk down to the junction with Generals Highway and turn left. Walk 50-100 yards. This boulder will be on your left, right off the road and clearly visible. This route will trample less vegetation and makes the boulder impossible to miss."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,ee311f57-0f52-5320-9d03-310f76613243,8f8248ff-57ba-50e8-b001-40982d2e4c6b,1ad7463c-d2c3-5bd3-b900-76e9526deb14","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","* SEKI Bouldering","Wuksachi Lodge","Junction Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.75896,36.60569]},"bbox":[-118.7595201439486,36.605240339818145,-118.7583998560514,36.60613966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116496666","area_id":"GtdGPNLDW9O5AHbpUm3rFA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:56.136Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:53.915Z"}
