I would imagine that such a well defined line has been climbed, and there was definitely chalk on the start holds.

The crack starts small low down and widens quickly to hands, then fists and finally goes wide less than half way up. The feet are excellent. For the most fun, resist the urge to start on the high jug. Plug a hand jam and start on the small feet before giving into the deliciously good holds and solid feet for the rest of the way up.\n\nWalk off the back.","protection":"Two pads if you aren't solid, but it's V1 with great feet and jugs at the top.","location":"Look directly uphill from the main set of boulders. You will see several tall formations covered in chicken heads. Â This one is the furthest up the hill, behind the others. The crack will come into view as you walk up hill towards it. The direct path to the crack along your line of site involves wading through manzanita bushes and some very difficult scrambling. It is not recommended, though possible. Instead, look right of the lowest down formations and you will see some granite slab. Make your way up onto it, then turn back left and work your way up to the crack. You will still have to wade through manzanitas."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,ee311f57-0f52-5320-9d03-310f76613243,8f8248ff-57ba-50e8-b001-40982d2e4c6b,9a12b01d-de72-5e70-9b1d-ed1acf3ff5df","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","* SEKI Bouldering","Wuksachi Lodge","Clover Creek aka Spirit Heal"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"},{"count":1,"label":"V0"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.75021,36.61876]},"bbox":[-118.75077023889449,36.61831033981813,-118.74964976110546,36.61920966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115314289","area_id":"mhKwHd5yXnCbHe0azz/13w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:56.136Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:34.161Z"}
