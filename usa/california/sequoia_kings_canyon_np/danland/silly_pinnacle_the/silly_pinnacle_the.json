Another smaller gully goes past a blocky chimney to the Squirrel Crack and the mid-pitch double cracks of Silly Pinnacle. The Squirrel Crack follows large cracks and flake roofs to a large, 6‚Äù+, off-width leading to a bolt belay with a small stance. You will notice from the belay that bolts and a crack ledge lead right. This alternate climb leads to the final bolt ladder of the Silly Pinnacle.

You can stem the tree to reach the first bolt. Continue aiding past the pins and a couple bolts until you get the left-leaning crack. This crack and two of the three bolts afterwards have been free climbed at 5.10, the crack takes small stoppers and TCU's.

The pitch finishes with a low 5th traverse left to the anchor. 5.10 C1F or just C1F. 90'\n\nThe second pitch is a short but fun 5.7 fist to hand crack that is stout for it's grade, climb the crack for 40' and traverse left along a ledge and climb up a face with a small crack to the bolted anchor. 5.7 .55'\n\nThe third pitch is the cool aid pitch that starts with a large overhang that you surpass by aiding a left-leaning crack through it. That crack mostly accepted cams but the rock quality isn't the best so placements are suspect and an angle piton was helpful. There are two fixed pins as you come out of the overhang, check them before you trust them. A reachy bolt-ladder takes you to the summit. The bolt ladder requires a mantel and generous hero looping for those who aren't 6'.
