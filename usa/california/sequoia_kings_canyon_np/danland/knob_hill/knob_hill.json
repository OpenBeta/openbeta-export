I am 6’2” with a lengthy reach.\n\nMantle a knob and then clip the first bolt. Move up and right to the next knob. From here, you can reach/fall to the large knob up and right, or dyno to it. From the ground to here is pretty cruxy. Next, follow the features and bolts up. Its easy at first, but gets pretty thin for a couple of moves before you can reach up and right for a bomber pinch. After this, it’s fairly easy face climbing up to the anchor. You can lower, or follow the ramp left to Your Way, or the knobs right, to My Way\n\nLet me know what you think! I don’t have very many opinions on the grade so far.","protection":"Bolts, 7-8 of them","location":"Located between Your Way and the Highway . Can be used as an alternate start to the upper pitches of these climbs as well as to access My Way. Look for the line of bolts up the steep knobs, just to the right of the wide crack. Can access the top to set a TR by climbing Freshman at 5.7."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,9d58d701-5a13-5dd7-a88c-3e7846534ec8,9c514de5-c244-5a14-8c84-7546d98dcca4","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","Danland","Knob Hill"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.76343,36.43855]},"bbox":[-118.76398893516554,36.43810033981812,-118.76287106483444,36.43899966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119231380","area_id":"nFFN5cJEWhSMhHVG2Y3MpA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.76398893516554,36.43810033981812],[-118.76287106483444,36.43810033981812],[-118.76287106483444,36.43899966018186],[-118.76398893516554,36.43899966018186],[-118.76398893516554,36.43810033981812]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:17.309Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:58.213Z"}
