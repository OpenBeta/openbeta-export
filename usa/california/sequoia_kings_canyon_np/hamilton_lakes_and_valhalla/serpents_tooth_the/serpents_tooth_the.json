Burly crack climbing in a truly amazing setting. Such a unique route capped by one of the wildest pitches imaginable, let alone deep in the backcountry. Possible to do in a big day from a Hamilton Lake bascecamp. See approach photo.\n\nP1 - After roping up when the approach gets steep, gain the obvious balcony type ledge at the bottom of the splitter. Working to it from the right seemed the safest. One bolt + #2 anchor on top of ledge.\n\nP2 - Boulder problem start leads to a long crack/ramp/corner. Climb past a couple bolts and gain a nice ledge. (5.11/5.8R 50m)\n\nP3 - Continue up corner to a stance (5.10+ 30m)\n\nP4 - Continue up the corner with some big moves between good jams to a blocky area at the base of the business (5.11- 40m)\n\nP5 - A very steep and awkward handcrack in the corner leads to a rest below the slot. Plug a #5 in there deep and then it's chicken wing dyno time. Very Wild. Like the Harding slot, only harder... yup. If you're really tiny, you might be able to squeeze in early and skip the crux. For most, there's an amazing flake on the face that helps you to go around the tight entrance. Once inside, pass a couple bolts in the squeeze and belay on huge ledge. (5.11++, 30m)\n\nP6 - Short face leads to the top of the summit pinnacle.\n\nDescent - One 30m rap from the huge ledge below the summit off a new single bolt.","protection":"Doubles to #3, 1#4, 1#5, 1#6 optional","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,39fd615b-bd45-5c02-aed2-c3d586ff519d,56b8905f-e412-5ec7-b699-917dd9f22b45,184d9803-5363-5fe8-addc-23f45ee77051","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP","Hamilton Lakes and Valhalla","Serpent's Tooth, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.58251,36.5515]},"bbox":[-118.5830697509436,36.55105033981814,-118.58195024905642,36.55194966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112129598","area_id":"GE2YA1NjX+it3CP0XudwUQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.5830697509436,36.55105033981814],[-118.58195024905642,36.55105033981814],[-118.58195024905642,36.55194966018187],[-118.5830697509436,36.55194966018187],[-118.5830697509436,36.55105033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:18.950Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:22.166Z"}
