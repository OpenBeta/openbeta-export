She for some reason took this seriously and started trying it. She did the v11 part (anger management extension) pretty easily. There was a weird lip traverse to get around one of the trees. Then you came to these two crimps with good feet. The next part is an overhanging prow. We started to try this in iso and could only do a couple parts. Analise got all the moves on this v10 part except for the main crux. The main crux involved bumping from a terrible crimp to a sloper sidepull and then coming into a sloper undercling. Then you would do the main crux move: you would come into a sloping pinch. I don’t know how but she held it as if she was doing a sign language “Q” (look it up). She didn’t link all the moves and the climb was forgotten for a bit. Today we went back to stoneface and  while I struggled on v5’s Analise was speaking sign language with the wall.\n\nAnalise’s send video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/deUiE29Cef4\n\nThe 360 degree traverse will likely be linked soon once we go back.","protection":"Pads","location":"Left of the thing"},"__v":0},{"_id":"jCZ+QUU0W4eDEoCjF494nQ==","name":"Reverse midnight lightning","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.27816,37.89666]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"120217652","mp_crag_id":"108147896","climb_id":"jCZ+QUU0W4eDEoCjF494nQ==","areaRef":"XJUqV/qGWyqhb8OqXgr8fA=="},"content":{"description":"To the right of the slab with a rock behind you.
