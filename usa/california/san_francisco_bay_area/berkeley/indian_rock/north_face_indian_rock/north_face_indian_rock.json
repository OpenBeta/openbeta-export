The \"manufactured\" tag comes from the fact that problem involves the stacked stone wall along the pathway just down from the Pit on the north side of Indian Rock.  This is clearly an artifically constructed structure, but don't let that stop you.  If it's any consolation, I didn't build the wall, nor was I the first climber to play on it.  It's been a few years since I last did this problem, so it's quite possible that the whole wall has been overgrown with ivy once again.  If so, it may be necessary to do some pruning to rediscover the holds.\n\nThe object is to traverse the wall from one end to the other.  With the many gaps and fissures between stones, this is a trivial exercise.  So we'll add some rules: everything on the wall is on-route for the feet, but you're only allowed to use six (6) handholds.  Furthermore, each handhold can only be used by one hand (three for the left, three for the right, no matching allowed).  The top of the wall and both ends are off-route for the hands.  The start and finish involve stable stances with a leg wrapped around the end of the wall.\n\nWhen I was introduced to the problem, it was the Eight Hold Traverse.  Over time, it became the Six Hold Traverse.  Further hold elimination seems unlikely, but consider it a challenge.  Beta hints: I faced out at least twice in my sequence, and it may be necessary to release one hold before you can grasp the next.  Like all good traverses, once you've mastered it in one direction, reverse it and run laps.","protection":"Pruning shears","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"iV14H4mxXNGga5HZEtm0yA==","name":"Indian Rock Traverse","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.27321,37.89229]},"left_right_index":15,"mp_id":"105735092","mp_crag_id":"120537691","climb_id":"iV14H4mxXNGga5HZEtm0yA==","areaRef":"8YllwyktUECgx/Sld1Ix/g=="},"content":{"description":"Start as low as you can on the main rock, pretty close to where the path forks and goes out of the park, or around the rock.  Go uphill, into the pit, and exit to the left of the roof problem.\n\nThere are several cruxes, and probably about 1,000 different variations to this route. The toughest section is probably bridging the gap near the cave, and the next 2 or 3 moves.\n\nHeight is misleading on this route:  Yes, you're only 5 feet off the ground, but the route itself is some 75 or so feet long! Go and go and go.  Topping out in the end should neither be scary nor require a crashpad.  If you've survived the rest of this route, you should be able to climb the final top out with one hand. Breaks are plentiful on this traverse, there a definitely a few sections where you wish there were a few more.\n\nYou can also reverse this route (starting at the bottom of the roof problem, instead of the top) and working downhill.
