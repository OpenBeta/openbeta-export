Climbing is tough for the first 3-4 moves, and then feet get techincal, but the climbing eases in difficulty.\n\nThe route is named as such because it represents the first time that my dog Senior (aka Stinkbomb) has returned to the rock, which was first attacked by drunkenmaster and Brian several weeks ago and that day Senior decided to find a nice piece of human shit to rub his face in. Then after I'd climbed it, Melissa was attempting the second ascent and ejected down the hillside after a hold broke and stopped 3 feet from the road where a road biker was timed so she would've ended up on the road about 5 feet in front of him when he was going about 40 miles an hour.  She was saved by a heel hook on a tree limb amongst her backflips as she rolled about 25 feet down.  I was climbing Stinkbomb at the time, and all I could see was a splotch of yellow tumbling down the hillside, and could hear a bunch of people saying \"oh shit!\"","protection":"A pad, and at least 3 spotters.
