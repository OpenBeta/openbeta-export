This is V5 in the Jim Thornburg book. There was a little crimp to the left of where I started, but it seemed a bit obscene to start there so I went with the obvious line (no topo in the book). While I feel like this is easier than V5 it is certainly worth doing. Let me know if anyone has more information on this route, I couldn't find specifics online before trying it.","protection":"1 Pad","location":"On the Trailside boulder in the middle of the face"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,915faeed-6c49-5845-83e9-8529c8e245f5,45cadcd0-158a-5265-b0e8-b82ee933c0cb,9103ab1b-4647-5346-a9bc-593cdd0611df,66a4c448-8cda-5a70-b133-d98140901100,39d4e8c6-ecde-5b47-8993-8a71699c6e8b","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Francisco Bay Area","Mount Tamalpais","Mount Tam Boulders","Lakeview Boulders","Trailside Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.59074,37.92846]},"bbox":[-122.59131007129,37.928010339818144,-122.59016992871003,37.92890966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114388450","area_id":"OdToxuzeW0eJk4pxaZxuiw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:13.146Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:40:40.558Z"}
