Unfourtunately, it's also the easiest way down.  There are no bolts up top.  There is no protection, though you might get a medium friend in under the undercling halfway up.\n\nThis is not a route for the faint of heart.\n\nClimbing starts on excellent rock with some interesting mantle and undercling moves. As you get near the top, climbing gets simpler, but the quality of rock degrades.\n\nWatch your step on the way down.  It's a LONG fall into the talus field below.","protection":"A pile of pads will help for the first 15 feet.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,915faeed-6c49-5845-83e9-8529c8e245f5,030b865c-f6b4-503d-aaf2-c3ce08d2ac60,75ec7e9f-4f67-583e-b60a-b4b96c7a6311,3e17dc9e-31ba-535c-9b2d-9a594a3f2e3e,6bb3ec45-34bd-501e-9747-21a851bb94cc","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Francisco Bay Area","Wine Country","Sonoma Coast State Park","Twin Coves","Southmost Black Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V-easy"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1417,38.45822]},"bbox":[-123.14227423326327,38.45777033981813,-123.14112576673674,38.45866966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105734366","area_id":"a7PsRTS9UB6XRyGoUbuUzA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.14227423326327,38.45777033981813],[-123.14112576673674,38.45777033981813],[-123.14112576673674,38.45866966018186],[-123.14227423326327,38.45866966018186],[-123.14227423326327,38.45777033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:45.900Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:44.975Z"}
