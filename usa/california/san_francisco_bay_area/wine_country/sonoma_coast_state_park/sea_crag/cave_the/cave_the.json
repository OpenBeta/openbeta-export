The start is fun, though just like the Sea Cave, I wonder why the climb continues up over the corner. It's about 5.1 up above the roof, unless it's wet.\n\nThis route may be wet, so plan accordingly.\n\nThere also seems to be a variation to this climb that starts in the cave, and comes up over the roof towards the first bolt.  My guess is that this alternate would also go at about a .12a, though I haven't climbed it.  At high tide or on a windy day, this alternate route will be soaked.\n\nIf you get to the first bolt, you're done. If you're on lead and you fall before the first bolt, have fun calling a helpicopter to get yourself out!  There's tons of jagged slippery rocks in the base of the climb, and it's about 15 feet to the first bolt.","protection":"3 bolts to a 2 bolt top anchor.  You can walk to the top anchors to set up a top rope, though bring a really long sling to reduce the horrid rope drag is recommended.\n\nEither stick clip the first bolt (which is 15' off the ground and past the cruxy start), or bring a stitch kit.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"mxZNVLzDVQe8t6jZM4Ek3w==","name":"The Sea Cave","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Jason Campbell","type":{"trad":true,"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.1641,38.47912]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105735083","mp_crag_id":"105734222","climb_id":"mxZNVLzDVQe8t6jZM4Ek3w==","areaRef":"F+B8uYt8XUSgovkiyAEnJA=="},"content":{"description":"This route ascends the overhanging western face of Cave Rock.
