The rock of the first crack and chimney are solid but the rock along the ridge is brittle, requiring caution (a canteloupe-sized handhold broke off at the crux on the first ascent). Rope drag can be problematic, especially at the crux, and can be reduced by setting up an intermediate belay at the summit of the First Musketeer, although the anchor is less than ideal.\n\nDescent: Downclimb the class 4 gully and chimney on the northwest (uphill) side of the gap between Third Musketeer and Tooly.","protection":"A set of cams including big #4 and #5 cams (I used five cams for protection and two more for the anchor), a runner (summit of First Musketeer) and two double runners (summit of Third Musketeer and summit of Tooly, the latter useful if top-roping Tooly 5.6).","location":"The Three Musketeers comprise the northeasternmost pinnacles of Looney Tunes.
