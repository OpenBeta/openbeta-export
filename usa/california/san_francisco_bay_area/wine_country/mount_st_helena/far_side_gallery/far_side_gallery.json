Make a few committing 5.9 moves over the bulge (a fall could result in a sprained or broken ankle) and continue up a 5.7 slab protected by a bolt. Unfortunately there is no anchor at the top of the slab, so continue scrambling up about 50 feet of class 4 boulders (or easy class 5 if you move right above the tree and go up an offwidth crack) to a single-bolt anchor (can be backed up by a cam) near the top of the formation.
