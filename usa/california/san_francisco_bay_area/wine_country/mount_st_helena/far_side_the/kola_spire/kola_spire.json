The route moves up and onto the left face of the spire.  Great holds and long reaches will get you into the exposed section on the extremely unstable looking vertical flake. Take care with clipping the 4th bolt; one wrong move and you could end up hanging in the tree below. Also be careful of the large loose block just above the main flake--a human could easily pull this down.","protection":"4 bolts, shares shuts with Kola","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"C6NRHXwBWrSuw65lb9zVdA==","name":"Kola","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Chris Summit","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.61885,38.65153]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105735548","mp_crag_id":"114780217","climb_id":"C6NRHXwBWrSuw65lb9zVdA==","areaRef":"6Nk7cDLqVACu44AZTxYwag=="},"content":{"description":"This steep slab route is on the highest spire at the Far Side.
