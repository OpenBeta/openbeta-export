Mostly big ledges to grab and step onto. I made it a bit more challenging by avoiding easy stuff, but then you’re grabbing iffier holds. Watch out as some of the rock breaks off - I punched myself pretty hard when one came off. Wear helmets for sure, and use belay glasses if possible (or sunglasses at least if the belayer must look up). No dangerous-sized rocks came off.\n\nNot sure who established the route or what its true name is.","protection":"2 bolts.

Use a 70m rope from those bolts and throw it down to the right side (when facing below from the bolts) of a tree. You will need to rap down with the rope to get it to the bottom. There is a short wall a bit below the anchor, then a class 4 scramble before the main drop.\n\nThis route will rub your rope.
