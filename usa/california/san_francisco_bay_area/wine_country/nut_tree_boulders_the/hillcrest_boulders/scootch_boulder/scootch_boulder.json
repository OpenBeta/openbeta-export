Unclear if this had a name so I made one up that went with the theme. If it already had one please let me know so I can change it. Start as shown in the topo/beta video, then keep traversing right through the start holds for Scooth'ems, ultimately making a big move out right to a small brick pinch and up (see picture for precise holds and sequence).

Traverse the entire boulder to the right staying at least 6 inches to a foot below the jugs near the lip of the boulder. This seemingly holdless variation to the traverse requires finding all the small, often sharp or bleak holds and dialing in the sequence before sending this super sustained enduro test piece. A good route to work on  when taking a break from working the near by Scotts traverse as it's a short step down in difficulty, but not endruance. Named after a small fire swept through the area a day or two after the FA.","protection":"Round up for the thistle that grows in the late spring.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,915faeed-6c49-5845-83e9-8529c8e245f5,030b865c-f6b4-503d-aaf2-c3ce08d2ac60,2e82a3d0-9e8f-5e81-b916-c2efe4bd278d,63d1e661-9c2e-5b33-b660-5bb5330c38d1,56ce913e-d5ac-5d4e-bad7-f27d997125e1","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Francisco Bay Area","Wine Country","Nut Tree Boulders, The","Hillcrest Boulders","Scootch Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"},{"count":2,"label":"V7"},{"count":1,"label":"V6-"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":2}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.9866,38.3936]},"bbox":[-121.98717371970397,38.393150339818135,-121.98602628029602,38.394049660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108309680","area_id":"Vs6RPtWsXU661/J9mXEl4Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:47.980Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:40:14.223Z"}
