Work up to the undercling set about 20 feet off the ground, and then keep to the arete to the top.\n\nThere is a possible variation that would head up and right from the undercling, avoiding the arete but moving up a slopey bulge using small chips that give traction in the soft sandstone of the bulge.\n\nI believe that the face just to the right of this climb was an existing route, but there was a small dead shrub at the top of this route that literally melted when I touched it, and also a small sized block that appeared to be a hold that pulled out, leaving a good sidepull hold.","protection":"Setting up a toprope for this route can be a pain in the butt. Use a huge sling and run it around the rock just behind the pillar on which the climb stands.

Castle Ridge 5.5R and Castle Rock Arete 5.6X.\n\nStart at the base of the obvious spine of rock that eventually leads up towards Castle Rock, the highest rock outcropping in Pine Canyon. Follow the ridge up, with some climbing at the beginning and various points along the ridge. Crux for me was towards the bottom on an insecure feeling slab move. You can climb off the ridge to the left at about half way next to some bolts and a tree. You also stop when the ridge ends just before Castle Rock Arete. But if you continue you are quickly vertical again, a bit steeper then the ridge, but not hard. At the top climb to the left on carved holds from the summit (Summit Route 5.2) to descend. A fun short adventure right in the Bay.","protection":"This is a solo, no decent gear for most of the route.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,915faeed-6c49-5845-83e9-8529c8e245f5,cf84f08e-e906-52ac-8386-b9c6f2a6188a,1b6d0908-e7a9-50b6-8d66-7ac9e54542c2,cd15447b-a9a0-53db-b2e8-66802a9d64c6","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Francisco Bay Area","Mount Diablo State Park","Pine Canyon","Castle Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.98688,37.88162]},"bbox":[-121.98744970853714,37.88117033981814,-121.98631029146286,37.882069660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107988847","area_id":"zRVEe6mgU9uy6GaAKp1kxg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.98744970853714,37.88117033981814],[-121.98631029146286,37.88117033981814],[-121.98631029146286,37.882069660181855],[-121.98744970853714,37.882069660181855],[-121.98744970853714,37.88117033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:08.661Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:08.301Z"}
