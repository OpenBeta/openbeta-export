The 8 bolts are clearly visible all the way to the top.  IF the bolts are good, (hard to tell how the integrity is in this soft sandstone), this route is well protected.  The rock is very loose and crumbly and basically you could come off at any time.  The trick to succeed on this route is NOT use the obvious larger holds but carefully select holds that are not flakes, not big, and whatever you do, don't pull on anything harder than you have to.  And be light on your feet!  Somehow, succeeding on this route is very rewarding in a strange way...","protection":"This route has 8 bolts with a two bolt anchor.  All of the bolts are quite new and seem to be the 3/8 inch version.  You can back up the anchors with a long sling around some small bush trunks.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"l3FwYVEkXpqzxLV2NAhM1g==","name":"Dingleberry Crack","yds":"5.8+","grades":{"yds":"5.8+","french":"5b"},"fa":"Chad Suchoski","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.98771,37.88072]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105806409","mp_crag_id":"107982548","climb_id":"l3FwYVEkXpqzxLV2NAhM1g==","areaRef":"fb+4kiZwXkGDIvNTxp8MTQ=="},"content":{"description":"This route starts on face moves then quickly moves to hand jams and stemming. The gear is solid but the rock on the face to the outside of the crack is not so much. Try and stay deep in the crack. The crux comes high while moving past a (questionable)piton and a diminishing crack to more face moves. Its a bit runnout above the pin. Feeling squirrelly, top rope it. Its a great lead, but a more convenient top rope.
