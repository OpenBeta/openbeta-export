After you move out of the corner, look for a far right foot hold to help with the mantel. When i put up this problem I made sure to knock off any loose rock i could get my hands on before making the FA but due to the loose nature of rock around the area id recommend you due your part to make sure nothing you grab is loose (specifically the jugs at the top).","protection":"","location":"go to the back of the rock near the creek and you'll see the obvious corner."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,915faeed-6c49-5845-83e9-8529c8e245f5,cf84f08e-e906-52ac-8386-b9c6f2a6188a,6265eccd-a324-5f1b-bb0a-b96d1b6005e2","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Francisco Bay Area","Mount Diablo State Park","Roadside Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0-"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.94091,37.86791]},"bbox":[-121.94147960251924,37.86746033981814,-121.9403403974808,37.868359660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116603117","area_id":"YmXszaMkXxu7CrltG2AF4g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:08.657Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:40:34.464Z"}
