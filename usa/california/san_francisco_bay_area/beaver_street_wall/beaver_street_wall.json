I've heard reference of this being in a guidebook at 5.11+, which seems plausible (after a few burns on it I was able to find a few foot-chips that made the crux much easier than my first go).\n\nAs with Dawn Juan, there is a short 5.10d/5.11- ish crux in the lower section.","protection":"Top rope only.
