There is a flake that juts out and points towards Angel Island at the base.  There are two small moons right next to each other right above this flake.  Use these moons as the starting hand holds, and use the flake as the starting foot hold. Start traversing counterclockwise (the next move should be to a downwards horn underneath an outcropping out the rock. Traverse until you come to a cavity in the rock. This should be at the other side of the outcropping of the rock.  Begin ascending.  Go above the out cropping where there should be an abundance of nice holds.  Harmony bears slightly left here, you're on the route if on your left there is a pretty nice horn and you have to come close to a hand-foot match to get to a pseudo-rail for a foot hold. finally on your right is a really nice bucket at the top of the rock. You'll have to search for this bucket with your hand for a little bit, but once you find it you'll fall in love with it. Mantle and top out. You should be at the highest part of Turtle Rock.  Why did I name this Harmony? As soon as you go over the outcropping, there is an intense moment of pure bliss and peace.  When I first sent this problem, at this moment, it seemed as though I was no longer a separate entity from the rock, but rather a new part of it.  I rarely find this kind of genuine and infinite focus and oneness with anything other than on Harmony.  It is certainly not the most difficult or technical of bouldering problems I have ever done, but it is by far and away the most spiritually inspiring problem I have ever done (hence my obsession with Turtle Rock).","protection":"A crash pad is all you need, it is a little high, but the higher parts are the easier parts of the problem","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"x+sFYjUHVu6WcJZFoHwQQw==","name":"Gold Rush","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.49157,37.91104]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"114388236","mp_crag_id":"105734162","climb_id":"x+sFYjUHVu6WcJZFoHwQQw==","areaRef":"2jM+ppmQUNuaOO0v0Uflhg=="},"content":{"description":"Climb up polished slopers and edges to the top","protection":"Pad","location":"Right side of the arch of the mini cave"},"__v":0},{"_id":"uJ646297X9i4I4uvnrfLhA==","name":"Fools Gold","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.49157,37.91104]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"117014780","mp_crag_id":"105734162","climb_id":"uJ646297X9i4I4uvnrfLhA==","areaRef":"2jM+ppmQUNuaOO0v0Uflhg=="},"content":{"description":"Low stand start and climb the semi highball line.
