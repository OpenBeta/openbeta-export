Make your way up the face without using the sides/aretes and with bad feet down low.\n\nA super obvious face and good moves using this start/finish. Fast approach and great landing.\n\nRoute notes/nuances below:\n\nMaybe other ways to climb this face, but no public details or recent ticks, so this is likely the only line that still goes as a moderate.\n\nAn older book calls the face \"Direct Center V6\", but a more centered line either not possible now, or not V6, or just overly simple description (opinion). A right start/line may also be possible but would climb differently, more awkward start, and unsure of beta that works.\n\nIt seems possible to start with the left hand even further away from the arete. Maybe a little harder? For me seemed scrunched.\n\nNote on breaks: Near the top there is an obvious orange patch that suggests a break in recent years - no clue on whether it was used. Seems like it could have made a higher, more central top out possible?","protection":"one pad is fine","location":"The face of the arrowhead boulder.
