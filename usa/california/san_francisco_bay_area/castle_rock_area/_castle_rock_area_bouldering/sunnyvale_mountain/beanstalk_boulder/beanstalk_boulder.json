Make your way up through a pinch, and a helpful knee bar. Then go left through the two horn features (one lower and one higher). Top out just right of the upper horn feature.\n\nHolds for Heavens Ring to the left are off.\n\nOriginally climbed and graded as if the big sloper above the knee bar moves is off. I think a line straight up from the start using that sloper (and maybe some holds to the right) would be good, and probably hard, but I never fully cleaned it or tried it that way. The line is intended to get to and through the obvious horn holds in the middle of the face.\n\nTall boulder - thus the R rating. One dynamic throw from about 15 feet up seems to be the only scary move, and not more than V3.\n\n* I asked some prominent CR climbers who are still engaged in the community (and awesome, always willing to help), and they didn’t have info on this boulder. Also, fwiw, this boulder is next to the newer John Nicholas trail, which only opened in 2014. Before this maybe some bushwhacking to find and get to this - and further back in time some of this was gated and not accessible (from what I gather). That said, the CR area has been climbed for 50+ years, so you never know. If someone uncovers some history on this, lmk!","protection":"Ground is soft, A couple pads fine.
