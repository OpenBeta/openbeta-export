Descend a gnarly climbers' trail along Mount Doom's sunny west face. The ideal belay spot is an obvious series of boulders. From there, the climb is about 70 feet  high. The first 20 feet are easy, but unprotected scalloped sandstone slabs, 5.4 or so. Gain a series of classic CRSP  pockets and tie off a runner in a cave if you wish. After another 20 feet or so, you reach the \"big ledge\" of Morris's  guidebook. Aim for a small bush on the ledge. A vertical crack left of the bush will accept a medium nut. A couple moves of 5.6 get you to a large step. The underside of this step will take medium gear; I placed a medium hex and a medium nut. The crux of the climb is the next couple moves. Take the path of least resistance to overcome the ledge. The anchor  is 10 feet of class 4 climbing away. There are six bolts in plain sight: two rusty 1/4\" spinners, two decent 3/8\" bolts, and two brand new 3/8\" bolts, each with a rap ring.\n\nCopied from my Castle Rock page:\n\nsepstanford.edu/sep/morgan/â€¦","protection":"Leave the cams at home.
