A drop knee-layback deal to a (PG-13 if on lead) dubious reach. Second Crux is just below the two bolt anchor with a sandy hand-jam traverse lacking any feet placement, much easier than the first crux. I'd highly recommend TRing it before you try freeing it; it's a stout .11a if you fudge the movement with a nasty ground fall.","protection":"Most commonly Top Roped off of two shiny new anchors. If leading it, make sure to bring at least 2 cams in the 2-3 in. range for the roof and a few small nuts for the lower 1/2 of the climb (i think i used two #5 BD nuts, one .75 piece, one 1 in piece, and one 2 in piece).","location":"From the climbers trail it will be the first (and quite obvious) line that you see.
