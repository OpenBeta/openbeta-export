Once on the toe of the ridge weave your way up as it becomes narrower and more defined.  Eventually you will be on rock and climbing up and over boulders and sometimes quite narrow ridge sections as you gain 2000 ft to the summit.  Near the top you will intersect the southeast ridge at which point you turn right and climb up a large boulder field to the summit.  Awesome views in all directions.","protection":"your favorite pair of hiking shoes","location":"Approach:  From Bench Lake X-country southwest through open forest until you reach the toe of the Northeast ridge.  Gain the ridge by way of class 2 slopes.\n\nDescent:  Retrace the route or for a class 2 option descend the Southeast Slope and head over to Arrow Pass â€“ this is not the first pass you encounter on the descent but the second pass that is further east.  Further descend class 2 slopes and pass the small lake on its western shore.  Cross the outlet creek and head northeast back to Bench Lake."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,7497b2b0-4fd8-5134-a476-4e016be6582b,ddb9bea4-f200-504a-a49f-e8d1cef25c24","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","10 - Taboose, Sawmill & Baxter Passes","Arrow Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.49149,36.92825]},"bbox":[-118.49205250517758,36.92780033981814,-118.49092749482242,36.92869966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114076820","area_id":"3bm+pPIAUEqkn+jRzvJcJA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:44.015Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:20.123Z"}
