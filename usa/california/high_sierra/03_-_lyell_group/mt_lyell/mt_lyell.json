The East Arete proper can also be gained from either the glacier north of, or the cwm south of Lyell, both of which are considerably easier. There is also a way to reach the East Col from the ridge directly east (gained from Middle Marie Lake), this is also 4th class.\n\nUse\n\nRush Creek trail\n\n.\n\nRoute Approach\n\nAfter wading across the outlet of Lower Marie Lake, hike easily along its west shore and over the creek that drains Middle Marie Lake. Scramble up scree/talus/slabs on the east slope of the peaklet to the east of the outlet of Upper Marie Lake. Easily cross the outlet of Upper Marie Lake then head up and across the top edge of the permanent snowfield ahead. Cross this and on the other side traverse a ledge system to a short gully which leads to the easy scree slope heading up to the crest of the South East Ridge.\n\nThe Climb\n\nCarefully traverse this wild and airy Class 3 ridge, some loose blocks, until it becomes a talus slope, up this and when it levels off (before it becomes a steep rock ridge) cross (involving a possible snowfield traverse) to the notch which constitutes the East Col of Lyell.\n\nPass through the notch and onto the glacier and walk up this until it's possible to gain access to the East Arete, about where it stops being level and steepens up. Head up to and climb the ridge direct for a little while (4th Class) until you spot a large duck on the right of the arete. Pass this on its left and climb ever steepening Class 3 rock (more than one way to go) through a notch and up to the summit.\n\nThe arete direct is Class 5.\n\nThe Descent\n\nCarefully descend the route - this is least risky way off and back to Lower Marie Lake.","protection":"Solo, ice-axe extremely useful.","location":"Start from Lower Marie Lake."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,9e3d9453-b0f5-5774-8a79-174f42bcca6e,c27e23b7-8f22-5090-bec9-8786814d335d","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","03 - Lyell Group","Mt.
