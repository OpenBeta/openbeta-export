First section of the ridge drops in elevations and the second half takes you back up and to the summit of Mt Johnson.\n\nFrom the summit of Trapezoid Peak hike down toward the ridge (see drawn in photo) on easy 2nd class terrain until it becomes a ridge. For maximum fun stay on the crest of the ridge as much as possible all the way the the summit of Mt Johnson. There will be the small deviation here and there but for the most part it is pretty easy going.\n\nNOTE: I think that if you were to climb to the left (south) of the ridge most of the way and cut across to the southeast face of Mt Johnson at the end that it would be more like 3rd class - though I haven't done it that way myself.
