Or small diameter rope and a few nuts/slings. Crampons and Ice Axe seasonal.","location":"Approach from camp at Hungry Packer Lake, follow the broad ridge north of the lake, first through small trees then rock steps and boulders, and Alpine terrain to a prominent notch on the high col north of the peak, at about 12,700 feet. The route is the broken ridge right of the shallow gully which runs almost to the summit. Near the start of the climb the approach snow can be fairly steep ice in late season of a good snow year.\n\nI did not go the the notch but started the route lower down where the shallow gully met the snow - seemed like an easier start and cut short the slogging.\n\nWithout the snow it's a monstrous talus slog - so early season is recommended.\n\nDescent is by way of the South/East slope at Class 3 into the basin south east of the peak, stay high so as to pass over the low point of the long broad East Ridge and back to your approach route."},"__v":0},{"_id":"kkdhKQV1VxS3Y4hOBrKAVA==","name":"North Face - North Ridge","yds":"4th","grades":{"yds":"4th","french":"1"},"fa":"who knows","type":{"trad":true,"ice":true,"snow":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.66143,37.15028]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"114170844","mp_crag_id":"110944855","climb_id":"kkdhKQV1VxS3Y4hOBrKAVA==","areaRef":"z+JoU4gCUd+3xkmXqIiRzw=="},"content":{"description":"This route comes with a longer approach so I did it as a casual 3 day trip. Great campsites above Hungry Packer and at Topsy Turvy on the way out. Thought I was doing the NW RIdge, and though I am still not totally convinced of what is what, I fell like the route I did was the North Ridge. I kid you not, one of the best routes I've ever done in the High Sierra. Little bit of everything on a classic peak. Only wish it was longer. Time of year is important here. The alpine flavor means this is definitely a spring time route. The first half of the route in the approach gully is most likely not something you want to do in July. This is a May route for sure!!","protection":"Did this route by myself","location":"Same approach from Sabrina as all the other routes.
