Traverse hard left into a hidden, secondary couloir. Depending on the time of year and snowpack this part could be easy mixed climbing or pure rock. Expect mostly class-4 with a move or two of easy 5th. Rated 5.7 in R.J. Secor's book, there is no 5.7 climbing required anywhere on this route. Maybe the FA party took a more difficult variation near the top? From the notch, class-4+ climbing up and left along an exposed slabby ramp leads to the summit of the West Spire.","protection":"depending on conditions and comfort level a few ice screws, pickets, and a light rock rack could be useful.","location":"Obvious line. If you left any gear near the base, descend the cl-4 West Ridge towards Mt Wallace and down scree slopes back into the bowl. Otherwise, descend the cl-4 South Ridge and head skiers left/east towards Echo Col (the pass is not obvious - it’s the notch in the black rock towards the saddle). Cl-3 rock and snow slopes lead down to Echo Lake. Stay high on benches above the east side of Echo Lake until close to the outlet."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,ff0ed5c9-37cd-5472-9bc6-289e1196a3a2,3cbcef35-3945-5223-a87f-5ff6532f8138","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","08 - Bishop Pass & Evolution","Clyde Spires"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.65043,37.13996]},"bbox":[-118.6509940755539,37.139510339818145,-118.6498659244461,37.14040966018188],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117525590","area_id":"PLzvNTlFUiOof1/2Uy+BOA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:36.650Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:32.382Z"}
