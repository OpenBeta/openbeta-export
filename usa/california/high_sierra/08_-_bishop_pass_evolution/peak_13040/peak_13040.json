Expect physical and blue-collar crack climbing with a really cool crux pitch which pulls over multiple roofs. We linked P1 & P2, and combined the final 3 pitches into 2 long ones making for a 5 pitch route. It's kind of a choose-your-own adventure deal after P4.

We did not go to the true summit - it looks like a rather long and involved ridgeline getting over there from the top of the route. We descended the ridge to the right (North) by downclimbing and making a couple short rappels from slung blocks along the way to get into the chute on the right side of the wall.
