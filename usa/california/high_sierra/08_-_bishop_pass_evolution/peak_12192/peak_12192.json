You will see what looks to be about 5.6 climbing to get onto the ridge proper (I didn't go this way so can't say for sure) and to the left (east) will be a gully. Take the gully down about 50' feet until you can cut back right, in the direction of the ridge. Go maybe 20' and then head back up to the crest of the ridge as soon as possible.\n\nOnce back on top you are basically following the crest all the way with maybe a few small deviation. Soon after the ridge starts to head down (for the second half) it will turn to class 2-3 down to the low point before heading back up (3rd) until a couple hundred feet before the summit (4th).\n\nI didn't find a summit register when I was up there.\n\nThis is a great option if linking Hurd with Trapezoid, Johnson etc. and is at least as good as Hurd's NE Ridge and Trapezoid's North Ridge IMO.\n\nDESCENT: Â You can descend either the NW Ridge (3rd) or the south ridge (2nd) to the saddle between 12,192' and the start of Trapezoid Peak's North Ridge route.","protection":"Solo or light alpine rack and rope.","location":"Ascend Hurd Peak by any route you like."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,ff0ed5c9-37cd-5472-9bc6-289e1196a3a2,372df611-7c1c-5c0f-bc88-71241a0d7efb","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","08 - Bishop Pass & Evolution","Peak 12,192"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"},{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.56839,37.13551]},"bbox":[-118.56895404237615,37.13506033981814,-118.56782595762385,37.13595966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110945475","area_id":"Ny32EXwcXA+8iHEkGg1++w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.56895404237615,37.13506033981814],[-118.56782595762385,37.13506033981814],[-118.56782595762385,37.13595966018186],[-118.56895404237615,37.13595966018186],[-118.56895404237615,37.13506033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:34.528Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:40.925Z"}
