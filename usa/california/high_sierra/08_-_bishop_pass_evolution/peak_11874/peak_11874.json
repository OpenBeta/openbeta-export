Ascend about 150 feet of easy slabs (3rd/4th class). Above the slabs, switchback up scree, talus, and pine trees to the saddle south of the summit. From the saddle, follow the ridge to north/right through trees and over boulders until above tree line.\n\nAt this point you are near the south summit. Skirt the summit on the right/east side (4th/low 5th) and continue traversing across the small saddle above a scree/talus gulley. From here, a few low 5th class moves take you to the right/east side of the main summit platform.\n\nAscend the final 10-15 foot summit block on its east side via a shallow, flared handcrack. The crack disappears about 4 or 5 feet from the top of the block. A spicy, unprotectable 5.6 mantle move puts you on top. The downclimb feels quite exposed. If you are not confident on the mantle up, it would be best not to attempt the block as the downclimb is not to be taken lightly.","protection":"I soloed this route and felt quite comfortable in a good pair of approach shoes.  However, depending on snowpack, an ice axe might be needed.  As for protection on the route, the 5th class sections are short so a short/thin line (100 feet would be plenty) and 5 or 6 cams (BD 0.4 - #2 or #3) and a couple slings should do it.","location":"From Blue Lake, follow the trail to Donkey Lake, then onward to Baboon Lake. When the Baboon Lake trail turns sharply left and steeply downhill into the cirque/basin, turn uphill/right/west and begin ascending 150 feet of easy slabs (3rd/4th class)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,ff0ed5c9-37cd-5472-9bc6-289e1196a3a2,570e0ed9-2ea7-5d8f-bbd6-e0d716ed6436","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","08 - Bishop Pass & Evolution","Peak 11,874"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.62872,37.17458]},"bbox":[-118.62928433391903,37.17413033981814,-118.62815566608097,37.17502966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108319735","area_id":"Vw4O2S6nXY+71uDXFu1kNg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:34.528Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:29.643Z"}
