Follow it until it peters out (wonderful views of North Pal) then work across the Glacier towards Glacier Notch - climb the Glacier Notch couloir (loose in low snow). About 1.5 hours from Sam Mack Meadow.\n\nHike across (north east) to the base of the South West Ridge and scramble up it via ledges to the right of the crest.
