There's a shattered wide chimney at the start which as some loose rock, climb this and follow the ramp up and rightwards, with some high exposure, for a few pitches. Route finding is a challenge towards the end of the ramp, find the path of least resistance until the right ridge of the face can be followed leftwards to the top of the face.\n\nFrom here there's a towered ridge which leads to the summit, which will require more pitches/simul-climbing.\n\nDescent from the summit is via the Class 3 East Ridge.\n\nIf pressed for time one can descend a gully between the top of the face and the towered ridge westwards to a steep drop off, where a 100' rappel gains less technical ground.","protection":"Standard trad rack of nuts and cams, no need to double up.","location":"Follow the faint Jigsaw Pass Trail, the route starts on the left side of the face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,c6e36f00-8d84-5a2b-beaa-92d7a3061787,5a12ef12-3eeb-5e2f-8ff6-da89197980ec","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","09 - Palisades & Surrounding Peaks","Two Eagle Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.5223,37.13032]},"bbox":[-118.52286400369042,37.12987033981814,-118.52173599630957,37.13076966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111029909","area_id":"WhLvEj7rXi+P9tqJGXmA7A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.52286400369042,37.12987033981814],[-118.52173599630957,37.12987033981814],[-118.52173599630957,37.13076966018186],[-118.52286400369042,37.13076966018186],[-118.52286400369042,37.12987033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:36.104Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:43.811Z"}
