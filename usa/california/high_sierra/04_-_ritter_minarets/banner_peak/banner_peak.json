Good ledges can be found for almost all belays.\n\nGain the ridge by climbing a 4th class chute on the south side a little ways uphill from the toe of the ridge. Follow the chute through a narrow bit (this can be avoided by climbing some low 5th class rock on the right wall) and up some reddish orange rock to the ridge.\n\nClimb the ridge for 3 - 4 pitches of easy 5th class to a steep headwall. There seem to be several ways to go here, but the easiest is to traverse right around the headwall (staying below fixed gear and old tat) to the chute right of the ridge.\n\nClimb this chute for 30 - 40 meters until you can gain the arete that forms the right wall of the chute. Up the crest of this on some steep, fun rock (5.7) to where it rejoins the main ridge.\n\nFrom here you've got many options. 4 more pitches of right-trending, wandery climbing with big ledges gets you to a class 2 ramp leading to the summit ridge. Once there turn south (toward Ritter) and scramble to the top.","protection":"Alpine rock rack to a #3 Camalot.","location":"Start at the saddle between Banner and Peak 11440.\n\nTo descend head down the southwest slope (class 2) to the Ritter-Banner Saddle.
