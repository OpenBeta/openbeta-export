Loose in spots like most Sierra high mountain backcountry walls. This climb does not see many ascents. When Fred and I climbed it in the 90's we were the first entry in the new register - which was four years old. There are outstanding views north.\n\nApproach West from East Lake up Ouzel Creek, with wonderful views of Ericsson Crags in particular. It's a long, long approach, about 3000ft in 3 miles. The first 3 pitches have loose blocks - so take care.\n\nP1 (5.7) Climb the 1st chimney right of the central pillar.\n\nP2 (5.8) Another chimney, cracks in the left wall, do not go deep (5.7) then The Black Chimney has a 5.8 exit move and is sparse on protection (crux) - pretty commiting. Can be wet. Once out of the chimney head up and tackle an overhang (also 5.8), careful with loose holds, to a welcome ledge and bomber hexes.\n\nP3 - P4 (5.4) Easier climbing leads right and up slabs with more than one way to go.\n\nP5 (5.4) Easy and up to a ledge which is traversed left to a belay. Snow, perhaps on the left.\n\nP6 (5.6) A right-facing corner then step left up a 3\" crack.\n\nP7 (5.7) Cracks and ledges, almost to the summit ridge.\n\nP8 (5.7) Probably the best pitch. Traverse right to a short corner, up this then right again. Step around in a very exposed position, then up past some loose spikes and through a small notch on the summit ridge between two large notches.\n\nDescend down the East Ridge.","protection":"Standard rack - some long slings, the route tends to wander, ice axe.","location":"Start just right of the central pillar - snowline dependent."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,fad6caa2-322c-5f30-8810-02c3d56372ed,e8a9ea2e-7831-5327-b15b-dbd55646f029","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","11 - Great Western & Kings/Kern Divide","Mt.
