Any serious issues could just be passed by dropping off the South ridge down on to the eastern face.","location":"From the what can be considered the saddle of the SW Face route (where the pine trees ascend highest on the western side of the Whaleback) it's just shy of a half mile with almost continuous class 4 to the summit. The ridge is guarded by small fins sticking up in places. Most crux's can be passed on climbers right (east side), however I did pass one notable mini-fin on the western side.\n\nOne section in particular (about the half way point) could be considered a small tower (false summit) is pretty tricky to keep 4th.

It is definitely trickier than the south ridge. Most of the scrambling is class 3-4 until progress is impeded by gendarmes.
