Doable in a very long day from Mineral King. A backpacking trip over Kaweah GapÂ would be an enjoyable 3 day trip. The chute is quite obvious from the base lake and the route contains quite a bit of loose rock, since the Kaweahs are comprised of mostly metamorphic rock. A classic, remote summit, with views of the entire central Sierra.","protection":"A helmet and expert scrambling skills. Novice parties may want to rope up in a few sections.","location":"A clean line of a gully on the SW face, visible from the SW base lake just below 11,600'.\n\nSome research online and on Summit Post will provide some good beta."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,fad6caa2-322c-5f30-8810-02c3d56372ed,86dbd6b1-c600-5c84-8cbf-052318572d22","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","11 - Great Western & Kings/Kern Divide","Black Kaweah, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.516,36.545]},"bbox":[-118.51655970387394,36.544550339818144,-118.51544029612604,36.545449660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105812493","area_id":"htvWscYAXISMvwUjGFctIg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:44.015Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:39.683Z"}
