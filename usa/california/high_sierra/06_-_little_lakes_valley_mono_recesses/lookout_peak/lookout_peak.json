Scramble up a steep gully to the left of a creek, then scree to a notch, in early season snow can now be followed up to the col at the start of the South Ridge.\n\nClimb to the top of the first tower/peaklet, the crux is the steep rock before the top of this - and the easiest way lies to the left. Traverse the knife edge on the west side for a short distance, then gain a shoulder, it's an easy hike to the summit from there.","protection":"Solo - ice axe and crampons in early season.","location":"Approached from Long Lake, follow the west shoreline until you see a creek coming down a steep gully, there is scree at the top of it just before a notch."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,b9b4527b-a37a-552a-973e-94485cd95eb8,1dc7cc39-8c2d-561b-954a-4f7523443522","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","06 - Little Lakes Valley & Mono Recesses","Lookout Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.76694,37.41117]},"bbox":[-118.76750611146369,37.41072033981814,-118.76637388853632,37.411619660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113217878","area_id":"HcfMOYwtVhuVSk91I0Q1Ig==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.76750611146369,37.41072033981814],[-118.76637388853632,37.41072033981814],[-118.76637388853632,37.411619660181856],[-118.76750611146369,37.411619660181856],[-118.76750611146369,37.41072033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:36.102Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:21.306Z"}
