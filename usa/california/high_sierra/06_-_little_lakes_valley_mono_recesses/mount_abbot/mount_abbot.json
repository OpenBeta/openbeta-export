Climb moderate snow up the couloir until about halfway when a ledge system to the right allows you to escape and scramble up to the crest of the ridge. Follow the ridge south, it becomes knife edged and exposed in places, then relents and become easier across the summit slope to the top.\n\nBest done in early season after a good cold night. Later on suncups appear on the glacier and make travel a tad tiresome, especially upon the descent. Nice and alpine with snow on the summit slope.\n\nDescend by the same route.","protection":"Helmet, ice axe and crampons.","location":"Wide couloir on the right side of the east face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,b9b4527b-a37a-552a-973e-94485cd95eb8,8fbb8ca9-9b71-533e-957f-797c556bfd1b","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","06 - Little Lakes Valley & Mono Recesses","Mount Abbot"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.78485,37.38632]},"bbox":[-118.78541592378099,37.38587033981814,-118.78428407621902,37.38676966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111011175","area_id":"j7uMqZtxUz6Vf3l8VWv9Gw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:36.102Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:11.113Z"}
