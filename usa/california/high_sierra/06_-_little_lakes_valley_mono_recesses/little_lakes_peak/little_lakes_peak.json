See the ridge rising up ahead, and head S to start some scrambling on granite in 100 yards. The more sustained climbing starts around GPS lat long (N37.4025 W118.7467) - (altitude 11450ft/3490m).\n\nclimb\n\n: Overall navigation is simple: keep following the ridge going SSE until it meets the SW ridge about 150 yards from the summit, then E up to the top.\n\n- - . .\n\nSee route on Map\n\n. . - -\n\nThere are about eight \"gendarmes\" -- local high points that stick up from the ridge which can either be climbed up-over-and-down or bypassed around one side.\n\nMost of them can be climbed directly up their S end and descended on their N end. Some of them required class 4\n\ndown\n\n-climbing to get down off their N end. Generally not convenient to set up a rappel to get down.\n\nBut one of the earlier big granite gendarme or tower (around N37.3985 W118.7454) seems like it's more difficult than 5.6 directly up its South end for a couple of exposed moves or perhaps a longer sequence of 20-25 ft.\n\nHowever, in 2018 discovered there is a fixed rope with knot loops hanging down over this sequence (not present in 2017). Perhaps this could be used for protection (or aid).\n\n. . This South end could be bypassed by a descending traverse on its East (left) side (dramatic exposure, with possible loose rock) then up a narrow gully (loose rock for sure, with exposure) to regain the crest of the ridge -- and optionally \"tag\" the top of the gendarme by returning north along the ridge.\n\n. . Or if this seems too dangerous or difficult, could try instead scrambling around below the right (west) side of this gendarme and around the next ridge crest section - (but these sections are some of the most dramatic and interesting of the route).\n\nescape: Higher up on the ridge (around N37.3965 W118.7445, alt 12330ft/3760m) two steep talus gullies meet the ridge, so it might be possible to quit early and descend NE from there. But the fun interesting climbing continues to the summit.\n\ndescent\n\n: The \"normal\" descent would be down the South face to reach the trail a bit E of Morgan Pass (about 1670 vertical ft / 500m of talus+scree over a distance of 0.6 mile/1km), then NW + N on the maintained Morgan Pass trail about 3.5mile/6km to parking.\n\nFor additional fun interesting climbing (like 850-1000ft/260-300m length) - but mostly down-ward: From the summit descend\n\nthe NE Ridge climbing route\n\nto the col / notch (N37.3985 W118.7389, alt 12415ft/3785m) between this peak and the Mt Morgan SW ridge.\n\n- - . .\n\nSee route on Map\n\n. . - -\n\nThen NW down a steep talus gully (vertical 750ft/230m over 0.2mi/300m distance), then gentler about 0.4mi/.65km to meet approach route, roughly NW down through open forest to the maintained trail. Total about 3mi/5km from col back to parking.\n\n- - . .\n\nSee off-trail bushwhacking route on Map\n\n. . - -\n\nFor even more climbing and a bigger view: After descending the NE ridge, climb to the summit of Mt Morgan by its\n\nSW Ridge climbing route\n\n(additional 1375 vertical ft/420m up from the col), and choose a descent route from there starting NW then various options.\n\nOr go back down the NNW Ridge climbing route. Likely the moves will feel rather different in the opposite direction.
