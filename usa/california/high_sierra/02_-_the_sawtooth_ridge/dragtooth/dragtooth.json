Good offwidth skills aren't required for the crux, as stems and face features and liebacks can be used to get past the offwidth section. Build a belay on the ledge above the main corner.\n\nPitch 5 (100', 5.9): from the belay ledge make an exposed and slightly downward hand traverse to the lightning bolt crack splitting the headwall.  at the top of the crack, build a belay, or continue up another 100ft of 4th class slabs to a series of nice flat bivy areas and belay there instead.\n\nContinue up the 5.easy terrain (300ft vertical) to the summit ridge, and work your way along the exposed ridge to the summit (1000+ft horizontal).","protection":"Standard rack with double set of cams to 4\" (Two #4 Camalots are particularly useful).","location":"From Mono Village at the west edge of Twin Lakes, hike south along the Horse Creek trail up switchbacks past Horsetail Falls as for\n\nMatterhorn Peak\n\n.
