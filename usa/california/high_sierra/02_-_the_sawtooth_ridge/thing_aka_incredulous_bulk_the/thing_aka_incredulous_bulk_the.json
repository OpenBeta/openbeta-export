Here's how we climbed it.\n\nPitch 1: Steep splitter thin hands! Sweet! 5.11- or maybe more like 5.10, I dunno. Keep going past a short crumbly fingers section (5.10-). Belay on big ledges.\n\nPitch 2: Long wandering low-angle pitch, 5.7. Generally trend up and right to a ledge belay under some big stacked kinda spooky flakes, just left of the big arete.\n\nPitch 3: Head up the balancy thin groove (5.10-, small gear) then left out a short hand crack roof/undercling. Continue up hands to a stance belay below a couple splitter cracks.\n\nPitch 4: Climb the splitter hand crack on the left, then keep going straight up. Careful of a couple loose blocks. Belay or link into the next pitch. 5.9\n\nPitch 5: Up then step right to a brief offwidth which gains the ridge (5.9). 4th class to the top.\n\nAt the summit proper, there is a little 5.8 boulder problem to get onto the very cool and exposed summit block.\n\nTo descend, do one rap off the backside to the east into the notch. Climb over a gendarme (4th/low 5th but loose, be careful) to gain the sandy plateau. Head right (towards the Hulk), then ski down dirt slopes back to the base.","protection":"Doubles to #3 and one #4.","location":"The start is towards the right side of the main face of the \"Bulk\" in a small alcove -- see photo."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,d1d2f080-cf5d-57de-8d8e-5dd04f51716d,8a70d43c-c078-5cb9-9f89-13e0baf45c14","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","02 - The Sawtooth Ridge","Thing aka Incredulous Bulk, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.41662,38.12969]},"bbox":[-119.4171916393426,38.129240339818125,-119.4160483606574,38.13013966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117739081","area_id":"inDUPMB4XLmfiRPguvRcFA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.4171916393426,38.129240339818125],[-119.4160483606574,38.129240339818125],[-119.4160483606574,38.13013966018186],[-119.4171916393426,38.13013966018186],[-119.4171916393426,38.129240339818125]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:46.372Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:33.133Z"}
