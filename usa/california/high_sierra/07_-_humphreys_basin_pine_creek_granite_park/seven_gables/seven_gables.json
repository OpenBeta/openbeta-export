We were pleasantly surprised by the generally good rock quality.\n\n1. 30m 5.6 An approach pitch. Climb up a wide dike to a low angled chossy area.\n\n2. 40+m 5.7+ Step out left and follow flakes and edges up the left wall of the corner/ramp. Eventually, trend right and belay at a small stance in the corner with a good anchor near some flakes. This is just above a triangle ledge in the corner with no anchor.\n\n3. 35m 5.8 Move out left around the bulge on good holds. Climb a right-facing corner to a headwall, then step around to the left again, trending left and up to a decent-sized ledge in a blocky area with plants.\n\n4. 55m 5.7 Climb up a V groove for a minute then move right to regain the crest. Continue up moderate ground before eventually accessing a sandy ledge system on the left (gully) side.\n\n5. 45m 5.9+ Climb a set of steep cracks. Above this continue up on the crest, past a fun section of 5.8 crack and face to a belay on a blocky ledge below a steep wall.\n\n6. 30m 5.9+ Climb a pair of cracks (fingers and OW) to a roof. Step right and follow a finger-to-hand crack to the arete. Climb easier terrain until you can walk into a chossy notch. Belay here.\n\n7. 30m 5.5 You're trying to bypass the small tower above you. Pass through the notch, scramble down a bit, along, and back up again until you're on a ledge system.\n\n8. 30m 5.5-5.7 Ascend moderate but loose ground to the right, back to the ridge crest. Belay on a rocky ledge below some reddish rock.\n\n9. 50m 5.8 Climb a corner just right of the prow. Belay on a ledge under an offwidth with some blocks in it.\n\n10. 20m 5.7 Traverse left, following a crack onto the prow. Then continue up to the top.","protection":"Stoppers. Double set of cams from 0.3 to 3, one each 0.2 and 4. Its likely you'll encounter snow on the approach and possibly descent, plan accordingly.","location":"The summit area of Seven Gables is divided by a couloir on the east. This route climbs the buttress that defines the right side of that couloir. Start in an area of more orange rock."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7a68eb3f-1d6f-5bdf-863a-b1eeea8dad89,a9f6b0cd-2103-5a4d-947a-433294383c55,3f1b072c-6115-5bf5-8430-5bbc8fae88f2","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Sierra","07 - Humphreys Basin, Pine Creek & Granite Park","Seven Gables"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.83383,37.31155]},"bbox":[-118.8343953604619,37.31110033981813,-118.8332646395381,37.31199966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117722016","area_id":"PxsHLGEVW/WEMFu8j66I8g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.8343953604619,37.31110033981813],[-118.8332646395381,37.31110033981813],[-118.8332646395381,37.31199966018185],[-118.8343953604619,37.31199966018185],[-118.8343953604619,37.31110033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:34.042Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:40.582Z"}
