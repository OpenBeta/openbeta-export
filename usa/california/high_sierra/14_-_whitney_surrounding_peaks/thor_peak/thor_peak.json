A 10' class 3-4 chimney must be overcome to get to P1. P1 is marked with a fixed piton and stopper right off the deck. Make the crux 5.4 chimney move and gain easier ground heading up and right. Many options exist between class 3 and easy 5th. Choose your own adventure. You are aiming for a small red pinnacle which is passed behind from the left. Some easy but very exposed slab moves out right lead to left-leaning ramps/cracks, marked with the occasional fixed angle-piton. Once on the ridge, head west up class 2 talus to the summit of Thor Peak. I descended the north-east slope into the N Fork of Lone Pine Creek. If you do this, you will need to carry all your stuff.
