Jackie Florine once called this route \"Sporty.\" It's got some crack climb, a left-facing corner, a chimney, and some bolts.\n\nP1: 135 ft. Layback/fists in a right facing corner. Crux of the first pitch: reach left, there's really good holds, bombers. Throw your foot up to the lip and then crank up.\n\nP2: Short chimney. Make your body into a human wedgie. Piton available 20ft up. Possible to climb this with a backpack on.\n\nP3: 75ft, Giant Corner 5.10. Layback on the underside of a large flake.\n\nP4: Flake continues, and becomes thinner and more vertical. Belay station looks almost identical to the previous, so don't be confused if you feel like you're climbing in circles. Bolts.\n\nP5: Pendulum pitch! Lower out and swing left to a flake.\n\nP6: #8 metolius needed for this pitch. Don't drop it! Fingers to cupped hands. Great romantic lunch spot at the belay\n\nP7: 75ft, bolts. Don't go right! Crux pitch, still has some loose rock. From here, there is no turning back:\n\nthe only way down is up. **Climb it, or you die.**\n\nBelay ledge is a great spot for a bivy.\n\nP8: 100 ft. Start up the crack to the right of the belay. Splitter hands.\n\nP9: 160 ft. Shallow, right leaning, right facing corner. Mostly fingers, but bring gear to fists. Don't be lured into bad stopper placements. FA party blew gear here.\n\nP10: Similar to previous, but bolted. Pull on the bolt.\n\nP11: 5.10R. Killer fingers!\n\nP12: Do a sick deadpoint to a jug, and finish on the unprotected 5.4 slab.\n\nFinish the route on a 4th class scamble.\n\nTo descend: 2 raps, then walk off via Death Gully","protection":"Standard rack, Metolius gear only.
