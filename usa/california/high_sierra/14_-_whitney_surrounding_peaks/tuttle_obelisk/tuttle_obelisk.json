Pat Brennan listed this route as one of his favorites in all the Sierra. What's not to like?\n\nFrom the AAJ:\n\nIn June Brent Norum and I established the second route on this striking pillar. Starting a short distance right of the Rowell-Jones route, ascend a right-slanting ramp for 200 feet to the base of a large corner. Two crack pitches lead to a huge ledge. From here ascend the right of three possibilities: a curving, quarter-moon crack. Above this, the original route is joined. NCCS III, F9.\n\nAlan Bartlett, Buff Alpine Club\n\nThe last pitch of the original route follows a splitter leading directly up to the base of the summit block. A wild hand traverse beneath the summit block lands you on its backside. The final 20' summit block has no pro and no anchor. Solo up the chimney and make an exposed step across the gap to get on top of the tiny perch in the sky.\n\nFor those seeking something harder, a direct variation P1 starts around the corner to the right of the ramp, following twin cracks in a corner @ 5.10+ (Bob Cable & Eric Tipton 1998)\n\nFrom the ledge just below the summit, head west for 50-100' and locate a rap sling on a chockstone. One 30M rappel to the north will get you into the gully; follow the easy gully back around to the base.","protection":"Doubles to 3\", single 4\"","location":"First locate the Rowell-Jones route - the ugly bush-choked chimney & dihedral system that runs from bottom to top.
