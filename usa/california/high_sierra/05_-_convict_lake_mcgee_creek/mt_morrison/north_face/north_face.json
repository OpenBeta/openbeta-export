From the top of the North Buttress route, it continues on for two more pitches to the true top of the north buttress. The lower pitches on route are clean, committing, and often deceptively hard. The climbing itself on these lower pitches is aesthetic, adventurous, and some of the most memorable on the face. Higher up, the route becomes looser but much easier as it joins the north buttress.\n\nPitch 1 - Climb up the large red ramp below the north face. Find a place to belay below a large dihedral with a huge yellow spot a couple hundred feet up the face. The first pitch starts from here and climbs up the remaining red rock and transitions on to clean grey rock. When possible, traverse left onto a welcome ledge. This is the crux pitch of the route and the most run-out as well. It is a very serious and committing lead. It would be difficult to safely lower off once committed to the grey rock.\n\nPitch 2 - Run out slab leading up and right off the belay leads to a series of dihedrals. Climb around a corner into the one on the right which looks substantially easier than the others. Belay at the top of the dihedral on a small ledge below a short chimney.\n\nPitch 3 - A short chimney leads to a traverse left into the large dihedral with the huge yellow spot that is visible from the start of the route. Climb this a short ways before traversing left on an exposed slab out of the dihedral towards a ledge for the belay.\n\nPitch 4 - Continue left over large loose blocks to a short fun hand crack. Broken climbing from here for a full pitch leads to a ledge just right of a gully of red and yellow rock.\n\nPitch 5 - Continue straight up the arete immediately right of the north buttress from the ledge. If comfortable, it is advisable to simul-climb from the start of this pitch to the start of pitch 8.\n\nPitch 6 - More broken climbing up the arete.\n\nPitch 7 - More broken climbing up the arete joins up with the north buttress.\n\nPitch 8 - Steep and exciting climbing up the right side of a reddish dihedral leads to another large ledge.\n\nPitch 9 - Easy climbing up another headwall towards the obvious red chimney. Belay just before the chimney to avoid rockfall on the next pitch.\n\nPitch 10 - Follow the red chimney to the notch on top. This pitch has a lot of large dangerous blocks. Caution is required.\n\nPitch 11 - From the top of the red chimney, climb a fun crack up the right face. Pass the large flake on the left into a an easy wide crack. Belay on ledge.\n\nPitch 12 - A short very easy pitch leads to the top of the buttress proper and probably one of the best \"summits\" on Morrison.\n\nBy stretching a 60m rope to its very end, it is almost possible to link pitches 11 and 12. The result of linking them is finishing this pitch just short of the top and leaves a bit of exposed and loose 3rd class to go to where you can start to descend.\n\nFrom the top of the buttress a short rappel or 4th class downclimbing leads to easier scrambling for 300' to the summit.","protection":"The rack should consist of doubles in cams from .3-#2, single #3, and a set of micro nuts.

It takes the longest, straightest line up its namesake feature. If there was one route to do on the face, it would probably be this one. It runs the full course for classic Morrison climbing: run out face climbing, fun splitter cracks, steep jugs, knife edge ridge climbing, razor sharp flakes, and scree fields. Finding and following the route is easy: start at the very toe of the buttress and climb until you run out of rock.\n\nPitch 1\n\n- Starting at the toe of the buttress, scramble up a hundred feet or so to a large ledge. An obvious right facing corner marks the start. Climb up this and the slab after to a right arching feature. Follow this to a short steep section which leads to a nice ledge. With a 60m rope, about 10' of easy simul-climbing is required to reach a good belay.\n\nPitch 2\n\n- Climbing up and right from the ledge around the corner, leads to a dihedral with a wide crack where the left half is light colored rock and the right is dark. After climbing this for about forty feet, traverse left where possible across dark rock to the light colored rock. Climbing from here continues up obvious crack and corner systems. Set up the semi-hanging belay near the top of the crack system in a hand sized crack.\n\nPitch 3\n\n- Stemming and a bit of traversing leads left from the crack across more dark rock into the light colored rock again. Follow this light rock up to a large obvious ledge. An old piton here and the surrounding cracks make a good place to belay.\n\nPitch 4\n\n- A very short pitch of about 50' up to obvious double cracks. Belay on top of these at the ledge.\n\nThis pitch could be eliminated with a 70m rope if the first three pitches were stretched. The belays would be just after the ledge on the first pitch, after the traverse out of the handcrack onto the light rock on the second pitch, and at the top of pitch 4.\n\nPitch 5\n\n- This pitch is the crux of the route both physically and mentally and although the grade is not overwhelming should be taken seriously. Start by climbing a short pillar feature. The pillar flexes if cams are placed behind the upper half. Slab to an arete leads to a step left into a steep dihedral. Once in the dihedral, move right onto an airy arete for a couple moves before moving back into the security of the dihedral. The pitch finished off on a sloping ledge directly above that final dihedral.\n\nPitch 6\n\n- Fun face climbing up a very featured slab with the same lichen. A pin will be passed about half way up the slab.\n\nPitch 7\n\n- The crest of the buttress narrows dramatically to a knife edge. Continue along the crest.\n\nPitch 8\n\n- Broken climbing along the crest of the buttress. At the end of the pitch, there is a ledge for two. It is the only comfortable bivy site on the route, though others may be found on nearly every pitch above this. If comfortable, it is advisable to simul-climb from the start of this pitch to the start of pitch 12.\n\nPitch 9\n\n- Follow the crest of the buttress.\n\nPitch 10\n\n- At a tower along the crest, traverse left into a fun crack in a shallow dihedral which leads back to the crest.\n\nPitch 11\n\n- Another pitch along the crest of the buttress leads to the base of a short headwall.\n\nPitch 12\n\n- Steep and exciting climbing up the right side of a reddish dihedral leads to another large ledge.\n\nPitch 13\n\n- Easy climbing up another headwall towards the obvious red chimney.
