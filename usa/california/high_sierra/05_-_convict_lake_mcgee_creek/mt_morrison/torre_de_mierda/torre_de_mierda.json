It takes a fine line right up a buttress splitting the north face.\n\nThe first four pitches are straightforward and very fun. The rock is more solid here than elsewhere on the peak and in the area and the protection generally better as well. That said, as with all routes in the area: caution must be exercised. The route stays on the crest of the buttress, occasionally dipping slightly to one side or the other.\n\nPitches three and four are on a spectacular knife-edge arete with great exposure to either side. What is more unusual is the easiest climbing is on positive incut holds along the very crest.\n\nAfter the knife-edge arete, the climbing drops into third class scrambling to the summit. Depending on where the belays are, it takes between four and five pitches to complete the technical climbing.","protection":"The rack should consist of doubles in cams from .4-#2, with a single #3.","location":"The route starts atop a white slab of chossy rock.\n\nTo descend, third class downclimbing to the south into the notch brings you to an easy gully.

Pitches 3 and 4 are classic and really fun. If the whole route were like them it would easily be a 3 star climb, but as it stands, they offer a nice break from meandering loose alpine climbing.\n\nPitch 1\n\n- Start atop a blocky ledge and climb a broken face trending left to an overhang (5.8). Continue up a red ramp to where it ends. 60m\n\nPitch 2\n\n- A wandering pitch over easy terrain. Start by moving off of the red ramp onto the face following the path of least resistance and generally aiming towards the dihedral. The pitch ends on a tallus covered ledge below a corner leading into the dihedral. Huge amounts of rope drag were encountered on this pitch; it may be worth breaking into two short pitches. 60m\n\nPitch 3\n\n- A short pitch up a gorgeous corner crack to a ledge below the dihedral. 30m\n\nPitch 4\n\n- The Dihedral! Great climbing up the obvious dihedral (5.8). Belay at the top of the dihedral in the chimney to mitigate rope drag for the next pitch. A stellar pitch! 35m\n\nPitch 5\n\n- Two blocky and loose chimneys seperated by a tallus covered ledge. Easy climbing, but lots of very large loose blocks encountered. Caution is required! 30m","protection":"The rack should consist of doubles in cams from .5-#2 and a single #3.","location":"The route goes up the southern side of Torre De Mierda's east buttress.
