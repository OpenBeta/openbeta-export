Pull up to opposing slopers, a really sharp crimp, then to better holds following the crack line up and left. Tops out from the jug at the top of the crack line, virtually the same topout as Paul Rocks.\n\nNo harder than Paul Rocks, which IMHO is V3.\n\nConfirmed prior to FA with Paul Dusatko, FAist for the whole boulder. He saw this line as well but given his lack of inspiration for the two lines he established, indicated that he left it undone. Also confirmed with Rob Mulligan who knew of no ascent for the line. Lastly, the thing was pure choss and spider webs when I first noticed it.","protection":"None","location":"On the face to the right of Paul Rocks, starting at the low base of the boulder going downhill.
