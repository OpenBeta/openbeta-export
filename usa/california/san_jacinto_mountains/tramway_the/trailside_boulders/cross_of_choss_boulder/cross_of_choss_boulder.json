Crux is topping out the beach on top. The rock crumbles under your hands, but with the right technique and enough desperation, one can top it out and feel the elation of the Smackdown.\n\nEven after enlisting a small army of day laborers to clean the climb, rock still crumbles under your hands and feet at the top. But the climb still flows well and has some fun moves. Top it out. Do it right. Love life. Climb hard.\n\nNote: We heard the boulder may have been named \"Samurai X\" by another group. But there were no samurais in site, and the cracks form a \"T\", not an X. We suspect the boulder had an earthly shift at some point and was an \"X\", but after the shift, the cracks form a \"T\".","protection":"Pad.
