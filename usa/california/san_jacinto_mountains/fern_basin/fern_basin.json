This is my first project I have put up on here. Hope ya'll like it! This problem is a nice, mostly slopey traverse. The crux is the starting move, moving from the large slopey hold to the smaller sloper-crimp. Fairly easy climb, good for v2 to v3\n\ngym\n\nclimbers. In the picture the the green mark is the starting hold, the yellow is the other hand holds, and the red are the foot holds.","protection":"Crash pad is a good option but isn't need since you are only like a foot off the ground during the side step (traverse) part of the climb before topping out.","location":"In Fern Basin campground.
