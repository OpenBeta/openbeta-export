You start with both hands matched on a decent rail very low to the ground. You are basically horizontal at this point. The first move is to a second rail which is also pretty good. You then match this rail and either rock up to launch to a good hold up and left, or setup for a throw up and right. Both methods are about the same difficulty.","protection":"Pad","location":"See photo"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,7197701e-a308-5315-afe9-b29ace8a8565,005f4021-0897-597e-a58c-30d119d48735,9dbb6d71-c3b9-5a99-bd57-ebb613a7a8e9","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Jacinto Mountains","South Ridge Boulders","Shorty Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.69667,33.73493]},"bbox":[-116.69721070669459,33.73448033981814,-116.69612929330542,33.73537966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108441838","area_id":"nbttccO5Wpm9V+u2E6eo6Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.69721070669459,33.73448033981814],[-116.69612929330542,33.73448033981814],[-116.69612929330542,33.73537966018187],[-116.69721070669459,33.73537966018187],[-116.69721070669459,33.73448033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:15.509Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:18.710Z"}
