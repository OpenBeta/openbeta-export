At first sight, this looks fairly easy, but the challenge is the moisture of the rock. Starts off as a short traverse and just a few holds before you can either mantel up or continue slightly across and up before you top out at a large middle hold. Plenty of foothold options for balance. Possible to continue up after that middle hold. Depending on the tide, the water and sand is your crash pad. You can wear shoes if you don't mind them getting wet. Feel free to check out the spot and add beta!","protection":"Water/sand is your crash pad. Having a spotter never hurts!","location":"This is in the heart of the Treasure Island, Laguna Beach; just north of the Google/Apple map point. Just South of Shreve Dr. off the Pacific Coast Highway. Park on the PCH or in the neighborhood/parking north of the highway. Walk down by The Loft at Montage hotel area. Walk along the beach boardwalk. Make sure you're walking just North of Goff Cove and Mosaic Bar & Grille. Slightly North/West of that, you'll see stairs down to the beach right next to some park benches and a circular grass picnic area. Walk down to the small beach area Cove. In the shallow area of the cove and cliff where some people jump off is the route/problem."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,5da0e075-8ec5-5ad3-8136-49a5d4dacaa5,e0599b22-693c-56e2-af54-c7f1d58a320d,f6d44250-9d66-5e65-a671-fed8354c0009,d18b7f77-b880-5d46-8f8d-ff07ad42bbb6","pathTokens":["USA","California","Los Angeles Basin","Beaches","Laguna Beach","Treasure Island"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.7591,33.51432]},"bbox":[-117.75963932394787,33.51387033981813,-117.75856067605216,33.514769660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119467031","area_id":"0Yt/d7iAXUaPjf8HrUK7tg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:24.904Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:15:57.271Z"}
