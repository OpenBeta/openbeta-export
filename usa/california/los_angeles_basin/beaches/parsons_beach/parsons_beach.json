This 20 foot climb is easily done without protection due to the soft sand below. During high tide your feet might get wet while starting the route.  The rock quality is very good considering the erosive effects of the ocean/wind.  The route starts below a visible \"X\" formed by two cracks.  Continue directly up this face.\n\nYou can descend Mere Bere by jumping off the nose that faces the beach. Check for rocks under the sand.","protection":"No protection is needed as the sand makes for a natural crash pad.  However, it's possible to top rope the route.
