Climb up the easy ramp starting as low as possible and climb past 1 bolt straight up to a scoop to top out.","protection":"This is hard to protect we used to large boulders behind the climb, slung them, and clipped in a static rope. We pre clipped the top rope on the ground. Jeff stood on top of 'another fun crack' behind and I stood on the large boulder in front. Pulling the system tight we leap frogged it up and over. Luckily it was the right length on the first try!\n\nyou can still do this but now there are 2 bolts. there is one bolt for safety and one at the top to lower off of. I left an oval biner for lowering, there is no need to build an anchor and top rope this. maybe one day another bolt will get added for a more proper anchor.","location":"Very First large boulder you see on the trail.
