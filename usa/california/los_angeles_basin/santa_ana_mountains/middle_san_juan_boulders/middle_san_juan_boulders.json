The crux would be getting the right hand to the right side after throwing left hand to the left side of the arete off of the match start. Power moves short lived after hitting a block that will lead to the higher part of the arête. Good feet work will save you on the top out. Starting high with just hugging the arête would be around v1.\n\nFUN FACT:  Before i actually sent it , the jug was a lot bigger with a similar horn feature on the top of the jug as the bottom portion. Now it’s just an edge and a horn on the bottom. While resting from working it my friend Casey who is double my size pulled on the flake, flew off and rolled down the hill. Pretty epic situation inspired me to send it next go with the newly formed hold. Boulder has been cleaned and ready to climb!","protection":"","location":"The boulder is visible from the pullout where the coordinates of the Middle San Juan Boulders are.
