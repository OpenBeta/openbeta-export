Probably not worth making the 20 minute hike to solely climb this thing. However, it does make a great spot on the way down from the flag to hang out beneath the shade and have a fairly fun ‘n mellow climb.... Or If you’re local and looking for a nice day out in the hills..... Start as low as you can on crimps. Several variations if you look at it hard enough. We’ve removed all the loose rock (wasn’t much).","protection":"Pad (if you’re daring, but don’t really need one)","location":"Take the Bell View Trail until the boulder is directly left and up a slight hill.
