Nowhere else at Texas Canyon do you find tiny inclusions and xenoliths this solid, \"sticky,\" and sharp. Very reminiscent of gritstone that way. Use the incut holds left of the 1st bolt to get established on the wall and work up the sloping footholds to a right slanting sidepull and a hard pull to a three-finger pocket. Work through the pocket and stand in the pocket to clip the 3rd bolt. Continue up the face on amazingly sharp and solid xenoliths to the anchor. You'll definitely feel the burn in your fingertips on \"Let It Bleed.\" While it might feel contrived to avoid grabbing the rounded arete, trust the friction and gun for the three-finger pocket.","protection":"3 bolts & chain anchor, shared with \"Rhinestone Cowboy.\"","location":"Ten feet left of \"Rhinestone Cowboy.\""},"__v":0},{"_id":"cZPXauLBW6mQkysbPjZuCw==","name":"Fricken Chicken","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.40158,34.51406]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"111836528","mp_crag_id":"111351075","climb_id":"cZPXauLBW6mQkysbPjZuCw==","areaRef":"tmA8M+AgWTWaiiaq6UzTbQ=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the face to a good pocket and the 1st bolt.
