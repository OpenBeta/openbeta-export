The low angle front seems like an obvious (if easy) feature to climb and is probably somewhere in the 5.2-5.6 range. The rock is a bit lose so top-roping may be a better option than leading.\n\nIt's possible to set a top rope anchor using trad gear by scrambling to the top around the back side. There are no bolts at the top, so it's necessary to down scramble after climbing it to clean your anchor.\n\nIf you know the FA or the name, let me know and I'll change it.","protection":"Trad gear needed for anchor.
