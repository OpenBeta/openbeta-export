If you go in August (like I did), it's super hot and you need to bring a LOT of water. The entrance station has water available during business hours though, and the rangers are very helpful (thanks Tina!). Beware of two things in this area: Sandstone and thunderstorms. Some hand or footholds WILL crumble when you go to use them, so always test each hold first before putting your weight on it. Also, be careful to watch the horizon for storms if you're climbing in the afternoon. My partner and I were run off the route halfway through because of a storm that charged in very quick.\n\nThe park REQUIRES you to top rope because of how brittle the rock is here. You must walk around the back of the large famous rocks and up to the top to sling it for top roping.\n\nThe beginning of the route is almost a walk up, but there are some interesting bits of overhang as you go up. There's also a large ledge less than half way up where you'll see some raven roosts (do not disturb these please).\n\nAlso, I made up the route name for this site, but I'm sure it has another name elsewhere (i just couldn't find it). If you know it, please correct it and add more info! I just wanted to at least put one route on the page.\n\nEnjoy the beautiful red rocks!","protection":"No anchors at top, just a V-shaped boulder that you can sling or run the rope around.","location":"2 minute walk from the far parking lot. It's the most famous group of rocks, so it's hard to miss because it's just next to the road. The route is just directly below the V-shaped rock at the very top of these rocks. You go straight up finding holds along the way (these will always change because of the sandstone)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"98WqUtkRXmqDwOcJs6x5yQ==","name":"Random Rules","yds":"V0","grades":{"yds":"V0","font":"4","vscale":"V0"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.32131,34.48871]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118900055","mp_crag_id":"108706557","climb_id":"98WqUtkRXmqDwOcJs6x5yQ==","areaRef":"Vgx8O5ycXL+8DcdExs+J6A=="},"content":{"description":"Start matched on a good hueco.
