Scramble up to the first railroad spike and then traverse right with good hand holds until you see the obvious second railroad spike above you.\n\nGoing up yields a railroad spike and a bolt. Once you pass both you'll gain a nice depression/pocket which makes for a good resting stance. Place a piece and traverse back left where the rock type changes. As you traverse to it you will find small solution pockets to place a small 00 metloius micro cam or similar.\n\nClimb up past the old Charlet Moser Piton to a 2 bolt anchor. The second pitch is class 3/4 and ends at a bush. New webbing and a rapide are recommended for descent if you leave the first pitch anchor.","protection":"Small cams up to a red BD #1. Specific pieces very helpful to the route include green .75 BD cam for a pocket at the first traverse, medium offset (metolius red/orange) for a pocket at the nice stance, then a 00 grey metolius cam for a solution pocket during the traverse.\n\nTricams would be wonderful for this climb and add a lot of security.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,5da0e075-8ec5-5ad3-8136-49a5d4dacaa5,06388dc0-3fe7-57b9-8f0d-6aced6b7cc69,e5907f7e-70f5-5d22-863b-49aeb4aa7564,fd72dac6-43a7-57ea-aed1-81faeac19f6d","pathTokens":["USA","California","Los Angeles Basin","Angeles National Forest","Fish Canyon Narrows","PianoBox Prospect"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.59998,34.63156]},"bbox":[-118.60052648439596,34.631110339818136,-118.59943351560405,34.632009660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112242442","area_id":"/XLaxkOnV+qu0YH66sGfbQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:05.725Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:13:00.837Z"}
