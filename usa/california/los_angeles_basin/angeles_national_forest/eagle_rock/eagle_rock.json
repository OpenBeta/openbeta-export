(From Left to Right): It starts at the beginning of Far Far Left and continues all the way to the ledge under the far right tree. (I think of the traverse as an out-and-back that requires me to do the sequences from both directions.) All of the rock fair game for footholds, just don't touch the dirt. You could bring up boulder pads to cover the uneven sections, but most falls are safe. You shouldn't be more than a 5 feet off the ground even in the highest sections.\n\nI did laps on this early in the Pandemic, and although it's not powerful, it was a nice way to get mileage and practice footwork.","protection":"None or bouldering pad.

You can start from either side, just beyond the tree on far right or far left of the traverse. Starting from the left, use the same starting hold is Far Far Left, and just set off on the traverse.
