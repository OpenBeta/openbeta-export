Strictly avoiding the arête itself and the 2 inch ledge at waist level, climb a few moves of 5.10 until you can make a long reach with the left hand for a very large, obvious horn high on the arête. Palm the horn with your left hand, then reach directly for the top with your right. Edit—for people who don’t know what an “eliminate” boulder problem is, it means if a problem is rated 5.10+ then you do not use any holds, hand holds or foot holds, that would reduce the rating (make it easier). On ‘Son of Hera’ for example, there’s a huge pocket for the right foot down low, so that’s off-route. Capiche?
