It's a puzzler, requiring precise footwork, good finger skin, and subtle body English.\n\nThe lefthand arete is listed as a v1.  It's junk.\n\nResist the urge to scrub the hell out of this boulder.  Some of the rock around the problem is a little flaky, but the holds you actually use are super solid.  It's a cool looking boulder and brushing too hard could create ugly scars.\n\nThe v7 rating comes from James March's guide, subsequently copied into the \"5 star\" guidebook.  Craig Fry's book calls it B1+ Thin Face.","protection":"n/a","location":"Finding the boulder is easy, finding the holds is not."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,5da0e075-8ec5-5ad3-8136-49a5d4dacaa5,06388dc0-3fe7-57b9-8f0d-6aced6b7cc69,d60bf957-f630-52e6-b798-18b3b731f9cb,021307d8-e71a-5c56-83e8-e744c450477a,3f946663-376d-55a7-9f46-2492843b3909","pathTokens":["USA","California","Los Angeles Basin","Angeles National Forest","Horse Flats","Main Area","Papa Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.01591,34.34139]},"bbox":[-118.01645458651724,34.34094033981814,-118.0153654134828,34.34183966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112784429","area_id":"P5RmYzdtVaefRiSShDs5CQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.01645458651724,34.34094033981814],[-118.0153654134828,34.34094033981814],[-118.0153654134828,34.34183966018186],[-118.01645458651724,34.34183966018186],[-118.01645458651724,34.34094033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:07.199Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:45.863Z"}
