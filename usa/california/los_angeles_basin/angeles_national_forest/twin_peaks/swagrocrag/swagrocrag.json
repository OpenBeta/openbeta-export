Start at the base and follow a mellow 5.5 zig zag crack up for about 40 feet up to a slab. Follow 3 bolts up the blank slab and top out on a big ledge on top of the tower with a bolted anchor. From the top of the tower clip the anchor as your first piece and make an airy traverse out right for about 10 feet until you reach a crack. Make sure you back clean the first 2 cams in the crack so your follower isn't looking at a bad swing. Follow the cracks up until you merge into the cave section of Fish Taco.

The rock quality is superb! It's like climbing at Tahquitz back in the day, as there are some loose rocks, but nothing's gonna kill ya (unless you're stupid).\n\nThe route starts up a cool slanting crack on the southwest side of the formation. It traverses left for about 100ft or so best guess to a sort of a ledge above that really neat looking pine tree. It's smart to belay from here so communication isn't tiring. Next pitch goes up these two cool finger cracks to some really good holds and lower-angle terrain. It's a cool ridge scramble from there. Belay is best closest to the hillside, so the second can walk off easy.\n\nThis route was a lot of fun.
