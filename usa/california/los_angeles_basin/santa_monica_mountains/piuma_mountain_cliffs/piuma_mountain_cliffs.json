The wall looks as if it’s sediment with rocks in. You’ll have to edge your way up . The wall itself is pretty solid considering the quality of the surrounding rock. Most of your handholds are soft crimps slowly rubbing away with  bomber little coin sized  rocks sticking out.","protection":"The anchor consists of bolts with hangers, not rigged for rappel . No rings","location":"Walk down the path from the road . The path immediately curves left within the first 10 seconds of walking and then the path opens up with many routes. Continue straight out in the direction of the adjacent mountain. You’ll go down a rock that drops off about 3 feet and you find what looks like a long peninsula of rock extending outward with the number  “730” graffitied on it. Go  about 110 degrees to the left toward the ravine . Near a small pokey looking plant at the top there will be two tan hangars with the bolted route going down into the ravine. You can walk down to the left or rap off."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,5da0e075-8ec5-5ad3-8136-49a5d4dacaa5,d4bc238a-a074-5487-8f25-be77c3e82fed,c9537159-5b3b-588f-9469-c2ac64a2dfda","pathTokens":["USA","California","Los Angeles Basin","Santa Monica Mountains","Piuma Mountain Cliffs"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.66047,34.06908]},"bbox":[-118.66101283002598,34.06863033981814,-118.65992716997403,34.06952966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114396591","area_id":"yVNxWVs7WI+UacKsZKLf2g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:12.354Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:52.804Z"}
