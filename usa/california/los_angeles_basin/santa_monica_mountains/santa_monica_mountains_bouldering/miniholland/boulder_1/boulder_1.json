If you're familiar with whomever first climbed this decades ago please feel free to submit corrections. I have taken their rating as is but as with most book grades I'm sure there will be disagreement.\n\nWhile not as clean as going straight up the corner, this line is relatively prominent and is one of the more engaging lines on the roadside boulder (aka Boulder 1). The crux, as far as I can tell, is getting over to the face from the overhang.\n\nThe rock appears to have been painted at some point, presumably to cover graffiti, and this makes some of the holds a bit slippery. This gives the feet a similar feel to some of the painted rock at Stoney.\n\nThe end of the climb is vert/slab and should be relatively comfortable aside from the slipperiness.\n\nAgain, feel free to submit the name and any corrections necessary. I understand the community here can be very particular about things but this is line is second only to the roadside traverse as far as I can tell.","protection":"Bring a pad or two just in case.","location":"This line goes up the left-hand (when viewed with your back to the road) arête of the roadside boulder. The climb tops out on the face out a couple feet left of the arête. As the climb is a sit start, the starting holds are going to be whatever is comfortable to reach seated on the corner. There are two large jugs that most climbs should be able to reach on the right-hand side of the line, for example."},"__v":0},{"_id":"d4MNPOOMU8ChMKwVdhfmYA==","name":"Eye Sockets","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.8457,34.102]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"112919969","mp_crag_id":"112914544","climb_id":"d4MNPOOMU8ChMKwVdhfmYA==","areaRef":"Ffb9M9lWUaKUS1Ymb8lQfA=="},"content":{"description":"One of the coolest routes here, Eye Sockets ascends up just left of the arête in the overhanging area on Boulder 1.
