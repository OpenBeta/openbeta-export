Stepping to the right in a couple locations (and back left near the top) keeps the grade easier.  Once past the first bolt or two, the route is lower angle and more slabby.\n\nRappel/lower back to the staging area, or, a top rope of the unknown bolted route to the left can be accomplished by lowering the climber directly back to the base of that route, rather than attempting to walk straight over to it from the bottom of this route (no trail, very loose and steep).\n\nTake care with loose rock both on the initial part of the route, and, at the belay area and don't stand below on the trail if a party is already occupying the route.  There's no room up there at the belay anyhow (for more than 2 people).\n\nThis route would be a very poor candidate for siege top roping with a large group (just too much loose rock and too little area to belay/stand).\n\nA fun route to warm up on prior to heading to the main Tick Rock crag.","protection":"6 lead bolts lead to a two bolt anchor with rappel rings.","location":"Located on the right side of Suicide Rock, at the right staging area at the end of the right-hand fork in the steep, loose trail.
