After climbing to the left for 4 large jugs you then throw your hands up to some crimps. From there you throw to a hold not visible from the angle of your body unless you pull yourself up a fair bit. The topout from there is pretty easy. The name comes from the fact that birds like to build nests into he second gold of the boulder.
