Lots of opportunities to cross your limbs and work your feet. Crux move is right in the middle on the obvious sloper rail. Ends at the cave entrance or as far out as you'd like to venture.\n\nThis climbs great from right to left but I'm sure is un the other way as well. Enjoy!\n\n4/20/2017 EDIT - Went back yesterday to give the problem a go from left to right and it had decent flow. Right to Left is cleaner but if you wanted a solid work-out you could do the whole loop :)","protection":"A crash pad or two for some high foot moves. There are a few small boulders in the fall zone but nothing to stress about. Entire climb is very close to the ground.","location":"About 5 minutes walking up the very obvious and beaten dirt path from street or lot parking in Griffith Park on Canyon Drive.
