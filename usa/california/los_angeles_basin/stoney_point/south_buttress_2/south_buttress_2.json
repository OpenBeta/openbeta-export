Typical crimpy, delicate Stoney Point climbing. Similar to Beethoven's Wall, but with more exposure.

Direct start under the bolted line is a bit harder IMO."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,5da0e075-8ec5-5ad3-8136-49a5d4dacaa5,bb845c0e-2b05-5860-afde-fc190f1a806e,127e9b8c-0e5d-56e8-bbdc-499a2cddea07","pathTokens":["USA","California","Los Angeles Basin","Stoney Point","South Buttress 2"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.60373,34.27052]},"bbox":[-118.60427412710479,34.270070339818126,-118.60318587289518,34.270969660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105963232","area_id":"En6bjA5dVui73EmaLN3qBw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.60427412710479,34.270070339818126],[-118.60318587289518,34.270070339818126],[-118.60318587289518,34.270969660181855],[-118.60427412710479,34.270969660181855],[-118.60427412710479,34.270070339818126]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:33.218Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:07.174Z"}
