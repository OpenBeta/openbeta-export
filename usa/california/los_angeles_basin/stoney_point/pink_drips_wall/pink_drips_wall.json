Up then step left onto the pink drips - up the middle of the face in a great position, with lots of fun moves to a good rest spot just below the top. Now trend right to a big flake, onto this then worrying stuff to finish.\n\nVery similar to the steep face climbing to be found at Red Rocks (e.g. Tuna and Chips Wall).","protection":"Top rope. Anchor using the three glue-in bolts, they're close to the edge, you can set up a three medium cam anchor in a crack at the back, secure a static line, tie in to it and then walk with confidence to the edge to set up the anchor. This can also be used to back up (!) the bolt anchor, plus it you rig it correctly you can use it to hold on to until you're over the edge for the rappel.","location":"From the ledge - at a rock pedestal."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,5da0e075-8ec5-5ad3-8136-49a5d4dacaa5,bb845c0e-2b05-5860-afde-fc190f1a806e,49e3bbb6-507d-5ee7-b046-0bc13d94ea17","pathTokens":["USA","California","Los Angeles Basin","Stoney Point","Pink Drips Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.60373,34.27052]},"bbox":[-118.60427412710479,34.270070339818126,-118.60318587289518,34.270969660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105958119","area_id":"SeO7tlB9XuewRgvBPZTqFw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.60427412710479,34.270070339818126],[-118.60318587289518,34.270070339818126],[-118.60318587289518,34.270969660181855],[-118.60427412710479,34.270969660181855],[-118.60427412710479,34.270070339818126]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:32.772Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:06.344Z"}
