A top rope anchor with two bolts and double rings was installed by John Knight in Nov 2004 and the route was christened \"Poltergeist.\"  The location of the new bolted anchor can be accessed from the top of Ghost Upstairs via a short third class traverse with no bushes to trample and no loose rock.\n\nRock is solid and sound on the arête, but a little loose 10' to either side of the line shown in the photo.
