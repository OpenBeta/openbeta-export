Great bouldery sequences, and just enough rock between bolts to make you think twice about pulling out that slack to clip.\n\nPygmallion Effect is easily the most sustained route around San Luis Obispo. Most local hard sections are over pretty quick, but this one keeps you fighting for it for about 70 feet.\n\nIt's partner to the left is pretty similar in style - less than vertical, a little dirty, and very sustained. The only difference on this one is that clipping is downright scary. And the moves are harder. Tiny holds, slopey feet facing every way but the right way, and a giant slab looming underneath you ready to send you to the ER if you blow a clip or your belayer looks away.\n\nYou might be able to pull hard on small holds, but unless you are a magician with your feet this thing is just aching to spit you off. Keep Composure.","protection":"All bolts, optional 1\" piece at the top to protect some easy climbing at the top.\n\nThe big fear isn't so much the fall, but going for a ride to the low angle slab down and climber's right.
