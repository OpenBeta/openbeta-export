From here the route goes up and right to a good jug and then left to another jug, at this point you are halfway up the route and have reached the crux. The crux is a reachy move to a right hand crimp, work your left foot up and get your left hand to a bomber side pull. After that, the route continues straight up on good incut crimps and pockets with fun movement. You end up topping out the boulder on the right side of the giant flake at the top. Would recommend to TR the middle and upper section before going for the send. Overall a really enjoyable route and a great addition to the unloved Potato Boulder.","protection":"3-5 pads","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"W7irh1UkXU6wmSR46m/gbg==","name":"Sisyphus Direct","yds":"V7","grades":{"yds":"V7","font":"7A+","vscale":"V7"},"fa":"???","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.69421,35.30485]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119536847","mp_crag_id":"105737130","climb_id":"W7irh1UkXU6wmSR46m/gbg==","areaRef":"bBYYdJL0XJWHCkf6E/MQXw=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the same jug hold as the original line, climb a few moves into the left facing jug, then take the direct exit going straight up the boulder as opposed to trending left as in the original line.\n\nRipped off a fat undercling jug 20-25ft off the deck while on TR-solo back in August this year (video in comments). This could've resulted in a pretty catastrophic fall over the sloped landing and a sizeable rock doming one of my spotters if I chose to go ground up before cleaning the route. I'd highly advise cleaning leaves and choss off the top section if you're trying this right after the rainy season as the top of this boulder tends to get pretty rotten after it hasn't been climbed in a while. There are bolts at the top to set up an anchor which you'll need long slings for.

It's namesake comes from the first move at the start, in which you start on a nasty side pull and dyno up to a bomber hold with your right hand.  After the first ten feet of pumpy moves, the rest of the climb is real technical, with tiny ledges and crimpers.  Also this rock is really sharp, so be prepared for some sensitive/bloody fingers after climbing this.","protection":"Two bolts above this route that can be used to set up a TR.
