The start is pretty spanned with a hidden good foot under the boulder. Bump right hand in to a vertical crimp sidepull then pull off a huge committing bump with your right hand to a baseball sized sloper hole a couple feet higher. From there, figure out some delicate beta into the start of Slot (V6) and finish up the same topout. Beta for the stand start may change depending on which hand you can get into the good part of the slot hold. According to Joe, this route is supposed to be a slight eliminate because you avoid the jug shelf to the left of the left starting side pull for the sit-start; the route flows better without it anyways.\n\nBurly, delicate and perhaps a tad height dependent. Regardless, it's a super great route for those who climb the grade.","protection":"2-3 pads","location":"Left of the tree.
