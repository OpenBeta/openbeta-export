All routes start on a sandy ledge that is 40 feet below the summit and about 20 feet below the parking area.\n\nClimbing the right side of the face up weathered pockets goes at about 5.2. The arete that forms the left side of the face is 5.4-5.6 depending upon whether you climb straight up or layback the arete. Climbing up the center of the face is the hardest and most engaging line at 5.9. The challenge of this variation is discerning which holds will hold body weight.","protection":"Top rope by slinging the summit block and clipping a single bolt.
