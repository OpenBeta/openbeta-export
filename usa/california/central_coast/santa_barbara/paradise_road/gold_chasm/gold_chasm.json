From here, you can lower off a questionable bolt anchor, or you may continue diagonally up and left via strenuous finger-locks (5.11). The rock on the second section doesn't see a lot of ascents and is therefore on the chossy side, but increased traffic and (perhaps) a motivated bloke with a brush could turn this route into a classic pitch.","protection":"Hands to fingers. Bring doubles in the finger size if continuing past the first anchor. NOTE: there are bolts for the second section of the climb, but they are fairly old and rusted. If you intend to clip them, I recommend placing your own gear as well to back them up.","location":"You can't miss this line; it's the obvious left-facing corner system."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,c984beae-48b7-53e5-aaab-47e52901d46c,ed25ebdd-13ac-501e-9b4f-eb02356d9035,185521c9-c2d2-51dd-b694-018c069e4b56,1733c194-4339-555a-99ac-a46ca1624325","pathTokens":["USA","California","Central Coast","Santa Barbara","Paradise Road","Gold Chasm"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a/b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.76404,34.55551]},"bbox":[-119.76458598435232,34.555060339818134,-119.76349401564767,34.555959660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105990753","area_id":"FzPBlEM5VVqZrKRsoWJDJQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.76458598435232,34.555060339818134],[-119.76349401564767,34.555060339818134],[-119.76349401564767,34.555959660181855],[-119.76458598435232,34.555959660181855],[-119.76458598435232,34.555060339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:39.462Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:36.895Z"}
