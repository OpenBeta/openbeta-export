The Yowie is a problem that I tried a lot but never quite had the temps (or perhaps the cojones) necessary to send.\n\nStart as for Yeti (or lower) but when you reach the hueco right in the middle of the wall, rather than blast out left to the first jug on Yeti blast straight up to a cool sloper with a patina thumb catch. There are a couple sequences that will take you up to the slopey lip (both of which are much more technical than you'd expect, then use some fancy footwork and sloper magic to pull over the top. The upper jugs on Yeti  and Sasquatch are off.\n\nMy guess is around V7 but depending on how tough the last move is it could be harder. Would warrant 4 stars if it wasn't an eliminate but either way the moves are rad and the problem proud.","protection":"Pad (or 3)","location":"Start as for Yeti but head straight up after the hueco rather than out left."},"__v":0},{"_id":"hNngFOO8XoqmByfQR5i9YA==","name":"Yeti variation","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.8617,34.49764]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"119973731","mp_crag_id":"106767681","climb_id":"hNngFOO8XoqmByfQR5i9YA==","areaRef":"ugAYDMIdWXuwrRjs5O0aEQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the first holds on the right and move left to finish on Yeti.","protection":"Crash Pads","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"RBnnUSEqVTuNqn9hFe8dUQ==","name":"Yeti Direct","yds":"V7","grades":{"yds":"V7","font":"7A+","vscale":"V7"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.8617,34.49764]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107631790","mp_crag_id":"106767681","climb_id":"RBnnUSEqVTuNqn9hFe8dUQ==","areaRef":"ugAYDMIdWXuwrRjs5O0aEQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start with high with left hand in crimp side pull.
