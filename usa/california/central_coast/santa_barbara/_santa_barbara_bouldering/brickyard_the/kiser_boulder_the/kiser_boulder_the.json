There's a couple ways to go about it (some harder than others). Once you hit the dish blast up to the big (but slopey) rail where you can cop a handjam.\n\nAt this point you probably want to center your chi for the couple moves to come because although they're easy, you don't want to blow it...the fall from here would not be pleasant. When your ready to go a couple steep, flaring (but surprisingly good) hand jams lead to a pretty good jug to top out.\n\nA great problem that throws a lot at you.","protection":"A pad...or three","location":"The only route on the Kiser Boulder.
