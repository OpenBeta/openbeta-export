Once established on the nice edge at about 10 feet the difficulty eases somewhat. However, at this point the climbing changes from hard pulls on bad edges/pinches to balancy squeezing on mediocre slopers.

I'm really proud of this one.\n\nStory:\n\nIt was hot. Very hot. Bernd and I couldn't muster the enthusiasm to climb anything with edges, so we decided to get creative. For the last five years I had been scoping out massive boulders that intersect, an occurrence which typically creates flaring hands-to-offwidth cracks of a gritty, desperate nature. On the backside of the Charlotte's Web boulder, just such a discovery languished in undiscovered glory. Some digging, scrubbing, taping, suffering, and lots of laughing resulted in a truly burly and surprisingly technical off width roof problem.\n\nBeta:\n\nJugs and toe-jamming at the beginning, followed by hand-jams and side pulls. As you emerge from the cave, vicious arm-barring awaits. Once you figure out what to do with your feet, top the sucker out. Then vomit your lunch.\n\nI have really no idea how hard to rate this thing, because it requires such a unique set of skills. I said V5/6, but that could be a sandbag. Or not. Go with friends and long sleeves. You'll need the company of both to enjoy this rig.","protection":"No pad!
