Start with left hand on vertical crimp and right hand on sloping edge. The idea is to start with your whole body in the cave. Do a desperate and shoulder-wrenching move to a pinch at the edge of the cave. Figure out transition to crimp-rail without swinging off the rock, and top out boulder via highball slab. Amazing stone, amazing position, amazing moves. Did I say I like this problem?\n\nYou can start the problem on the right-hand edge of the cave as well using some crimps and heelhooks. It makes the problem significantly easier, but no less quality.","protection":"Good assortment of paddage.","location":"On the First Come First Served boulder at the upper right corner of hillside.
