Not in Oceans 11 or the Steve Edwards book, so correct me if its already been sent.\n\nWorth doing. Left hand start on small pocket just to the right of the crack closet to the road. Right hand start on large jug pocket below the next crack to the right. Aim for the two crimp/gaston features above your left hand and top out straight up or trend left, both rad.","protection":"depends on your style but probably just some shorts and a t-shirt.","location":"Located on the south face of the cracked boulder between the two V0 crack climbs."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,c984beae-48b7-53e5-aaab-47e52901d46c,ed25ebdd-13ac-501e-9b4f-eb02356d9035,23df14e7-05e6-58d5-aad7-75a368e4ba4a,89748a2a-d33d-5d45-90eb-49566b17438e,7f0c2f40-d04c-5187-995f-391185bd7091","pathTokens":["USA","California","Central Coast","Santa Barbara","* Santa Barbara Bouldering","Painted Cave","Cracked Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.78938,34.49892]},"bbox":[-119.78992561347873,34.49847033981814,-119.78883438652126,34.49936966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110224269","area_id":"fwwvQNBMUYeZXzkRhb1wkQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:31.449Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:04.665Z"}
