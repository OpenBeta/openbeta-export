Do you throw for the pocket? Mantle out right? I always believed the problem went for the pocket.\n\nWhich is rather hard, as in harder than V5.\n\nIn my opinion, throwing out left to the pocket, letting go of the sloping crimp with your right hand, catching the swing, then topping out the boulder amounts to a stellar V7 or V8. Things also feel reach-dependent, which might affect my perspective. Whatever grade you give it, I posted V5 since that's what Ocean's Eleven and the old Edwards bouldering guide says.","protection":"Pad.","location":"To the right of the big oak tree, on the side of the boulder facing the road.
