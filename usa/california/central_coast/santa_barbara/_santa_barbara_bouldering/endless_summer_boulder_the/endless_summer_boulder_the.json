The sit-start begins on obvious low crimp-rail. Crank some burliness right off the deck, figure out your feet, and try to turn the bulge and gain the slab. Once you attain the layback rail, fire to the top of the boulder, and, with your butt dangling fifteen feet in the air, press out a classic mantle!\n\nKeep in mind: when there's a healthy stream you can't properly sit-start the problemÂ—that is, you can't without placing your pad in a pool of rushing water. Get this sucker while the getting is good. You never know when the next rainstorm will fill the creek!","protection":"Lots of pads. We had four when we did it.
