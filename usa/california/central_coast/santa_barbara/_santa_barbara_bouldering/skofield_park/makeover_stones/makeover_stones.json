For as long as I have climbed at Skofield (20 years now), this problem eluded me, and many others. I could never figure out where or what it was. And even when I thought I found it, the moves seemed well-nigh impossible. Turns out it isn’t impossible, just weirdly reachy and dynamic.\n\nStart with left hand on cool pinch, and right hand on terrible pockets. Low left cheater stone is ON for the start (as per the old Edwards guide). Fire up and right to sloped crimp, and the game is on. Don’t cheat by bailing on to the jug of Press On Nails—finish direct, which is burly and honest.\n\nThis problem was rated V6 originally. I can’t for the life of me understand why. unless someone can show me some secret beta, I’m sticking to my grade. It’s quite hard.

Unsure about grade. The few strong climbers who have tried it have either walked away in frustration, or just gave it hell and found themselves at the top, bewildered and ecstatic—and still unsure about how hard it is.\n\nBegin with right foot in little pocket near the ground, right hand on tiny edge, and left on chalky ramp.
