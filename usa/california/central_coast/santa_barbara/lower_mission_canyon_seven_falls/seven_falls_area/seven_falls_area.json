Leviticus isn't THE most difficult climb on the central coast from a grade perspective, but it is certainly one of the most technically challenging. At 5.12d, it doesn't give an inch, and touts one of the more memorableand painfulcruxes for miles in all directions. If you can link through the bottom three bolts of this vicious and powerful line, you will likely have some shredded skin on at least one of your digits. And then the pump starts...\n\nWithout giving too much away, here's the breakdown:\n\n1) tie in, get nervous\n\n2) perform a stupid hard finger-lock boulder problem (V7 or V8)\n\n3) Grunt in pain\n\n4) Transition in to lie-back section of route\n\n5) Don't get tired before you get to the anchors","protection":"Six bolts to open shuts.","location":"Steep face on right side of creek before you get to the actual Seven Falls area (for those not \"in-the-know\", I'm talking about the swimming holes).
