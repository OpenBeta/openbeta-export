The reality is, this is a short climb and doesn't need protection with the right person at the helm. That said, it's advisable that you do bring and place gear.\n\nLost Hands has perhaps Santa Barbara's greatest section of #2 crack. The route starts in a magnificent splitter crack and then trends left as the crack zags. Transferring from the lower crack to the upper section involves smearing with very solid hands and proves to be a thrill. The jams are fantastic and the moves are very natural from bottom to top. Fair warning though, the top 4-5 feet reveal lower rock quality.","protection":"#1-3 and a standard nut set. Gear anchor at the top or sling the dying little shrub.","location":"This route stands just Northeast of the Land of the Lost main wall. It's secluded in an alcove.
