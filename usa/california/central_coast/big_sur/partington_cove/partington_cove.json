The start is a simple two handed start, up to a positive crimp on the right, and then out left to the base of the first arête. The first crux is a static right hand move to a small crimp on the adjacent face of the first arête. The second crux will be laybacking the crack in between the arêtes, working hand over hand to the top; be careful with your feet placement. There is no way to top out. The last move is a single hand touch to the slanted rock face above both arêtes.","protection":"","location":"Take the trail head at Partington Cove off Highway 1 (you can park along the highway). Walk down the dirt path and you will arrive at a crossroads. Go straight at the crossroad toward the beach, do not go left to cross a wooden bridge (if you've found yourself in a wooden tunnel you've gone the wrong way). Going straight at the crossroads will lead you past a warning sign about surf of unusual size and force. Follow this path down to a rocky beach. Looking at the water, the boulder will be to the right of the beach, almost at the waters edge. High-tide may prevent access to the start, but at midday, the tide was not an issue. The start is an arrowhead shaped horn hold about 3 feet above the ground. The route moves left around an arête and up a crack between two arêtes. Make sure to bring a crash pad or two. The surrounding ground is large boulders and rocks, would hurt very badly to fall without protection."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ZPFAizvqVramN1L7OLi0rw==","name":"Black rock hole","yds":"V0","grades":{"yds":"V0","font":"4","vscale":"V0"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.6968,36.174]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"107101661","mp_crag_id":"107101605","climb_id":"ZPFAizvqVramN1L7OLi0rw==","areaRef":"JlRVeeJSWXaxmy+9cKAoEA=="},"content":{"description":"At the end of the crack/flake wall there is a black boulder.
