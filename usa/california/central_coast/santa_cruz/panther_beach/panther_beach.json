This climb will usually be out of the surf, except in extreme cases, when you probably shouldn't be climbing in the area anyways!\n\nAt the base, you will find a large foothold about a foot off the ground, and there will also be a large pocket to serve as a starting hand.  Climb the white sparsely pocketed face up to the sandstone horn 25-30 feet off the ground.  Ther are several grips at the top that are only sandstone, as the white wall nearly disappears at the top of the route. Climbing is balancy the entire way, without letting up for most of the route.  There are very few good holds on the way up, though there are some good rests if you look. The climb becomes scarily balancy at the top.\n\nYou're done when you can grasp the horn, but DON'T dino to it, I personally wouldn't even hang from it.  This is sandstone, and I really don't think that it could withstand too many people jumping to it.  There are several ways to get up to the horn without jumping.\n\nFinally, once you've gotten to the horn, descend off the sandstone to the left.\n\nThis gets an vs rating despite the fact that the whole climb is over sand.  Without a perfect landing from a fall in the last commiting section in the route (feet about 15-18 feet off the ground), you WILL hurt yourself.  If you fall really wrong, you are going to need some hosptalization.","protection":"Sand is good, crashpads on sand are better.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"ap13aj+PXee/7KFQ0HRrnQ==","name":"Welcome to Panther Beach","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.1699,36.9924]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"116609748","mp_crag_id":"105733953","climb_id":"ap13aj+PXee/7KFQ0HRrnQ==","areaRef":"XHBeePqnVr+b/19a9NJwwQ=="},"content":{"description":"Comp style start to a traverse to a hang and drop matched on a crimp or drop off when you feel like it.
