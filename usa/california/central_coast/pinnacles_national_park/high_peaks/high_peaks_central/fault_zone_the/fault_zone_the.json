Descend a ways, and then begin ascending again, then turn right down what looks like a deer trail.  If you start heading up some steps cut into the rock  accompanied by handrails, you've gone too far.\n\nThe junction is 2 miles from the Bear Gulch parking lot, with about 1200' elevation gain.\n\nThere will be a steep, left-leaning crack heading up the buttress to a black water streak -- this is\n\nCondor 70\n\n(5.10a R).
