Medium to large cams can be used to protect the chimney to the first anchor.\n\nAbove the optional belay is low grade (5.1-5.2) slab with no bolts for about 30 feet to the summit. It's a bit run out but a #2 BD C4 can be placed in a pocket about 15 feet up if desired.","location":"Approach: hike north from the junction of the High Peaks trail and the Juniper Canyon trail about 0.4 miles (there is an outhouse at this junction, which is about 2 miles and 1200' elevation gain from the Bear Gulch parking lot). The trail will dip down, and then climb back up steeply, up some steps cut into the rock and a railing.
