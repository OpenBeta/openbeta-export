Start right off the High Peaks Trail and scramble up to the notch between South and North Fingers.   Climb a bit down into the notch and spot a wide crack on the pinnacle's north face.  Because of rope drag, some parties choose to belay in the notch.  There is a bolt and a boulder which can be slung for anchors.\n\nBy chimney between the South and North fingers you can gain the wall.  Further up, find four bolts, unfortunately placed after the first ascent, which protect the final few feet to the summit.\n\nRappel from two bolts and chain 95' back to the base of the climb.","protection":"Quick draws for the four bolts. Those wishing to protect the wide crack should bring large cams from a #3-#5 Camalot. A few slings and quick draws for the anchor in the notch.","location":"The east face of South Finger."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,c984beae-48b7-53e5-aaab-47e52901d46c,da25b985-1c4e-503d-9c4f-5713cbb30c43,138a1881-b289-597c-8d8b-b5fa32837914,af5d6fdf-7d94-512c-a0a6-9f3d8aea540c,52e0ecdf-9a18-5b2d-9e6c-8be374643301","pathTokens":["USA","California","Central Coast","Pinnacles National Park","High Peaks","High Peaks Central","South Finger"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.19777,36.48512]},"bbox":[-121.19832927096445,36.484670339818145,-121.19721072903556,36.48556966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119059470","area_id":"UuDs35oYWy2ebIvjdGQzAQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:30.849Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:15.119Z"}
