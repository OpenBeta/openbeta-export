With some leans and fresh hand holds you'll get to the next cam placement which is a little noticeable (there was nowhere else to protect) pocket that opened between some mossy crack. change position again and continue higher. you can utilize that two and a half after you've figured out how to apply pressure to the flake thats flexing under your weight(suggest-ably stay off the damn thing, by distributing your weight to the right, others wanna climb too before you start breaking things). after you pass the first forty feet you've survived the crux. I personally thought the crux to be after the first 10 and before 33 feet.\n\nThere is a tree at the top of the route that you can run the rope around and rappel off of.\n\nrated 3 stars for : oh my god I'm alive!\n\nPS I wouldn't normally have given any climb such safety rating, but having dealt with the fact that the crack you're protecting also happens to be the seemingly wobbly flake, I figure give people a heads up. I didn't want to fall. I don't think anyone does, but It may deserve an R/X rating.","protection":"I truly carried a full rack of Helium Cams and a purple BD 1/3 inch. I got by without using my 3.5 inch. I suggest Double 1/4 inch cam, double 1/3 inch cam, 2.5 inch cam,1 inch cam, 4 inch cam, with obvious draws with runners. there are not bolts. Use tree at the top out of the crack line to Simul-rappel down the wall and fight out of the bushes below.","location":"walk from either the side road pull off or the bear gulch parking/ employee housing.

It was actually pretty fun trying to figure out the challenging moves in the beginning and putting it all together.\n\nTraverse the wall as far to either side as you can without climbing on moss or getting too weird. Hardest moves are on the right, so traversing right to left makes sense. That's how we did it.
