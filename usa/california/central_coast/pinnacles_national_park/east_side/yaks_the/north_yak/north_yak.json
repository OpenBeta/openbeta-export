It is a decent Pinnacles style  face climb. The moves between the first three bolts are thin and difficult and then the climbing eases up.  The final moves to the anchor are lichen covered and there is some loose and hollow rock that should be avoided.\n\nCool flat grassy summit. Makes you wish you had some lawn chairs, cooler, and hibachi.","protection":"7 bolts of which 5 have been rebolted.  New 3 bolt anchor with quicklinks.","location":"One of the most entertaining aspects of this climb is the  4th class approach.  In between the North Yak and Yak Wall is a gully that is filled with chockstones.  Start up the gulley and go underneath the first chockstone. Continue another ten feet or so until you see a tunnel like opening. Chimney up the tunnel and take care not to dislodge rocks  on your partner.  From here continue up and left climbing over a boulder to a final tunnel up to the base of the climb."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,c984beae-48b7-53e5-aaab-47e52901d46c,da25b985-1c4e-503d-9c4f-5713cbb30c43,89cc6f6c-0b8b-5659-8314-51fc17f23ec5,f0af970e-c4f3-590f-a1bc-a26c7b9d162a,909f82fb-455d-54d8-827e-8b9ea24b95e1","pathTokens":["USA","California","Central Coast","Pinnacles National Park","East Side","Yaks, The","North Yak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.18155,36.47044]},"bbox":[-121.18210916502902,36.46999033981814,-121.18099083497096,36.47088966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120118986","area_id":"kJ+C+0VdVNiCfoueokuV4Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.18210916502902,36.46999033981814],[-121.18099083497096,36.46999033981814],[-121.18099083497096,36.47088966018187],[-121.18210916502902,36.47088966018187],[-121.18210916502902,36.46999033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:29.513Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:21.839Z"}
