A fun route if you're looking for something different, though most people would agree that Machete Direct and Son Of Dawn Wall are more appealing.\n\nThe normal way to gain the first pitch is to walk along the wall past Corona and Dos Equis: walk south towards Son Of Dawn Wall, and then follow a climber's trail from the base of SODW, up a fourth class ramp to gain a short bolt ladder.\n\nTo add a little more climbing, we climbed \"Beyond Destiny\" (5.7R) which starts just 10 feet right of Corona. From the top of Beyond Destiny, its an easy and safe 40 ft walk straight towards the wall, you will find West Face's initial bolt ladder way back in the corner.\n\nPitch 1: Climb the super easy bolt ladder, and then follow main wall up and left. The bolt ladder is only 4 bolts, but its actually really easy to climb up a little higher and reach the second bolt. After the bolt ladder climb up and left along easiest path but DO NOT climb into pink rock! Stay about 10-15 feet below it. Shortly after the bolt ladder you will see a two-bolt anchor up in said pink rock, don't go up there, the anchor you want is roughly 30 more feet left, following the easiest path. STAY OUT OF THE PINK ROCK.\n\nFrom the anchor,  you can unrope and \"3rd Class\" along the ramp allllllll the way over to the beginning of Machete Direct's fifth pitch. Wee!\n\nWhen walking north along the narrow ramp from the pitch 1 anchor, you will pass the bases of several bolt ladders. They are (from south to north) Los Banditos, Rock Around the Clock, Bills Bad Bolts, Daedalus, and finally Machete Direct Pitch 5. Note that Los Banditos is not in Young's 2007 book as it was established later.\n\nThe third class gets very narrow and loose, and gravel abounds, providing more a sense of 4th class.\n\nMy partner and I were happy to rope up again at the base of Daedalus's bolt ladder., using the first bolt as an anchor... a brown tricam also works in a pocket if you want backup... I took the rope over to the Machete Direct Bolt ladder from there. From Daedalus to Machete Direct I used up about 50 of my 60 meters of rope. No meaningful protection for traverse, but its nice to put at least SOMETHING between you and the ground.\n\nNOTE: The anchor you want is about 30 feet down the slab from  the start of the bolt ladder. A good way to tell where you are, is if you can SAFELY scramble down a few feet away from the bolt ladder, look up and Middle Tower should be directly over head. The bolt ladder goes up for about three or four aid moves, before free climbing up and left into the giant dihedral/flare that leads up along the base of middle tower.\n\nFrom there, follow directions for pitches 5 and 6 of Machete Direct.\n\nThe \"R\" rating comes from multiple opportunities to really change your life if your pro blows out of the shitty rock its in... and for the very sketchy traverse between the first official pitch and the final bolt ladder: the catwalk gets very narrow for a bit, and the bulging headwall forces you to crouch and scramble over a large chunk of rock about the size of a refrigerator that has visible tunnels eroding through the base of it, you could probably send the whole thing off the wall with a good kick... best be careful about how you interact with it.","protection":"We brought 10 draws, which was nice for extending cams.\n\nA few single and double length runners...\n\nA light rack of cams from 0.3 to 3 inches.\n\nUse those cams where you can! Dont hold back, i think my .75, my 1, and my 2 never left the rack but they certainly could have. Pro is sparse and shitty so dont worry about running out of cams.","location":"The easiest way to find the start is to climb \"Beyond Destiny\", which starts just 10 feet right of Corona. Beyond destiny is a surprisingly long, and moderately fun 5.7 with bolts that can be supplimented by gear (which you should already have if youre doing West Face). The bolts for Beyond Desinty go up and slightly right until you reach a bulge above a horizontal crack, and from there go straight up. Dont do what I did and completely forget about the cams hanging off your harness, which makes for a very very spice move to pull over the bulge while already being 15 feet above your bolt... 7 or 8 bolts total, I forget. Buy Brad Young's book!\n\nThe original way to gain the start is to hike past Corona, heading south to reach Son Of Dawn Wall, and then following a fourth class ramp from there, up and left.\n\nThe bolt ladder is way at the back of the overhanging headwall, right where it meets the main face of Machete Ridge."},"__v":0},{"_id":"jM68WsBsUyOfdQZwuy4H4A==","name":"Sons of the West","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Mark K.

This climb is suitable for a solid 5.9 climber with some aid experience. You will be much more comfortable (and efficient) if you can pull off a couple of reasonably well protected 5.10b free moves. The aid portions are short but often require you to step out of your aiders and make a few free moves. The second pitch is only 5.7 but is pretty runout (3 bolts in 130).\n\nRetreat: It is possible to retreat with 2 ropes by rapping the route but you risk knocking rocks down onto the trail below. At the top of Pitches 3 and 4 you can bail out right by heading toward the Badman Mezzanine. Two ropes make it easiest to bail but it is possible to escape with only 1 rope. If you only have one rope, be sure to study the Badman Mezzanine topo carefully or you will rap off the end of your rope!\n\nP1: 80 (direct start) - The original start chimneyed up the tree and worked its way along the ledge to the start of the aid portion (5.8/A1). The preferred start is the direct start. Two bolts protect the moves up to the aid section (5.10a/A1). The moves to the first two bolts are around 5.9. Bring a stick clip if the move up the first bolt spooks you. The crux of this pitch is between bolts 2 and 3. There is a mandatory free move off the last bolt before you reach the anchor. I found it a bit spicy after being in the security of the aiders to switch to free. Youll need six or seven draws (I always bring an extra in case I drop one!) to protect the direct start. Bring many long slings if you do the original start.\n\nP2: 130 - Three bolts protect about runout 5.7 climbing. Im glad I didnt have to lead this pitch!\n\nP3: 130 - Two old bolts are supplemented with small to medium cams on this fun 5.2 pitch.\n\nP4: 140  Six bolts on mixed free/aid climbing (5.9/A1 or 5.10b). Youll need to make a couple free moves between the bolts if you plan to aid the 5.10b section. The upper section in the waterstreak is super fun and only a tiny bit runout (5.7PG). This was my favorite pitch.\n\nP5: 120  Seven bolts supplemented with cams protect this mixed free/aid pitch (5.8/A1). There is a bit of 5.8 free climbing above the aid moves. Bring long slings for the cams in the gully. There are several very large and very loose chockstones in the gully. The crux on this pitch is NOT stepping on the loose rock. About 10 below the anchor, there is a bolt out right that protects one 5.7 move. Note  the Brad Young topo is NOT correct in this location.\n\nP6: 160  Two (or three?) bolts protect fun, easy moves under a HUG corner. One recently replaced bolt protects a 5.6/5.7 move above the anchor. The rest of the climb to the top is around 5.3. Watch out for pigeons exiting the crack!\n\nOptional P7: 80  Two bolts protect climbing up to the top of the Middle Tower. Rappel back to the top of P6 after summiting the tower to do the Standard Machete Descent.\n\nDescent:\n\nRap off the backside of Machete Ridge into the gulley. Then rappel 3-4 anchors (all bolted on the right) within the gulley until it opens up. Stay right on a Class 2 trail this whole time and avoid any of the cliffs to the left.\n\nOnce the gulley opens up walk right on a faint trail across a 4th class traverse above slab until you find trail again descending right down a dirt path through trees.\n\nOnce the dirt trail disappears and you find yourself among huge boulders go left. Look for a metal rail in the shape of an upside down \"U\". This brings you into 'the caves' trail. Walk left through 'the caves' until you reach stream bed. Retrace your approach trail to parking lot.\n\nOptional Pitches: From the top of Pitch 6 you can reverse the Machete Traverse and add 3 more pitches. P1: 5.2  Work your way westerly (unprotected) up and over a small tower to the base of the rappels. There is one bolt and ring at the top of the tower to protect the easy downclimbing. P2: 5.3 - Fourth class your way into a gully protected by two bolts. Belay at a pine tree. P3: 5.5  Move the belay up past a manzanita then do a boulder move down a short wall (7 or so). Belay (unprotected) as your leader works up to a single bolt then traverses under a headwall (on the leaders right). One bolt protects a 5.5 move to the top of a waterstreak. From the anchor, rap down The Hideout then 4th class your way to mother earth.
