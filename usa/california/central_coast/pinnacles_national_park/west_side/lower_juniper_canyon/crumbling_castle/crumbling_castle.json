Supposedly cams have been placed to protect these moves, but good luck finding placements.\n\nRappel 75' from bolts and chains.\n\nDave Hammack, George Larimore, Bob Smith and Alice Ann Dayton during the first ascent of this pinnacle in 1952 climbed the upper portion of the route.  Hempel and Roper added the direct start.","protection":"A couple of quickdraws for the bolts and something for the two bolt anchor.","location":"This route starts on the east face near its southern edge.  Spot the bolt on the face above."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,c984beae-48b7-53e5-aaab-47e52901d46c,da25b985-1c4e-503d-9c4f-5713cbb30c43,eec9de57-40f7-5e17-a855-54b8faf87e5a,1c52fa38-74cf-59cd-b0bb-9720e59f4be6,9db1c35a-8d47-5be2-92ae-69a4eb366931","pathTokens":["USA","California","Central Coast","Pinnacles National Park","West Side","Lower Juniper Canyon","Crumbling Castle"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.20153,36.48474]},"bbox":[-121.20208926822127,36.48429033981812,-121.20097073177875,36.48518966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119059624","area_id":"nbHDWo1HW+KSrmmk6zZpMQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.20208926822127,36.48429033981812],[-121.20097073177875,36.48429033981812],[-121.20097073177875,36.48518966018186],[-121.20208926822127,36.48518966018186],[-121.20208926822127,36.48429033981812]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:30.193Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:22.729Z"}
