It's not a horrible idea to place a chalk bag in the cave, as this is a fantastic location for a quick break. Continue right through the Hidden Middle (V0) problem's start. Once you reach the crack between the middle boulder and Devil's Dick (V2-), you get another break; if you're about 2-3' off the ground you can jam and stand without hands.
