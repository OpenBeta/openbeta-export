This is the crux of the climb, as it is dirty, and the move to get out and up is awkward. Once up there, you will work your way left past a great looking crack on the face, and out to the left under a triangular roof with some fun and interesting moves. Trend right again through some small easy overhangs to reach the anchors at the top. The anchors reside under a small pointy rock that juts out from the top.\n\nDescent: Rap or lower off the bolts, or walk off to the right. No rings/chains right now on the anchors.","protection":"Gear to 3\"","location":"The bottom is just scrambly/chossy boulders.
