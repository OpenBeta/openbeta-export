Keeping left in the crack/corner will keep it more interesting, while stemming and using the face holds and opposing walls on the right will keep it more towards a 5.8.\n\nThe crux is probably down low, and the only protection on the lower part of the climb is a couple of pockets for cams, and the first one is fairly high up after a pretty interesting start, hence the PG-13 rating.\n\nI thought it was a fun and interesting climb. We did some cleaning, but more is in order, and I think it will clean up nice.\n\nPretty good opportunities to build a gear anchor at the top if you'd like to top rope it first. you can go up and around either left or right with a bit of scrambling to get to the top. We'd like to put some anchor bolts at the top of these. They are fun climbs with a nice little belay area at the bottom.","protection":"gear to 3\"","location":"Deep into the corner right above the small cave."},"__v":0},{"_id":"NBkcGBCBX/akfcB84Ptsxw==","name":"Albino Peacock","yds":"5.8-","grades":{"yds":"5.8-","french":"5b"},"fa":"6/4/2020","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.17197,39.89568]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"118985995","mp_crag_id":"118985974","climb_id":"NBkcGBCBX/akfcB84Ptsxw==","areaRef":"jK4yz9eBWfCDbabN9pWQSg=="},"content":{"description":"starts with a hand crack in the corner with a few face features to the right and eventually works its way into an off width/squeeze chimney to the top.
