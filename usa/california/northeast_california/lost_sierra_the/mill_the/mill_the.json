No protection exists for this route.  To descend, down climb the chimney.  If you are lucky, you may spot a bat or two in the back end of the cave.  If you wish to find a way to the top side of the crag, this is an easy way up.  A short 4th class scramble exists above the chimney before the hiking commences.","protection":"No Pro, don't fall","location":"See Crag Map in \"photos\""},"__v":0},{"_id":"fENfzYF6UDSTg3dyT4vrFw==","name":"Bad Mamajama","yds":"5.10-","grades":{"yds":"5.10-","french":"6a"},"fa":"Katie Carpenter","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.72595,40.1927]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"109319043","mp_crag_id":"109318878","climb_id":"fENfzYF6UDSTg3dyT4vrFw==","areaRef":"KeO/apj3UKGHVg3urmMw5w=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the left corner crack over a couple of bulges to the anchors above.","protection":"Gear to 2","location":"See Crag Map in \"photos\""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,1a8ca51c-5dce-508c-9059-0720ba2e4f13,f0d8c351-ea97-539f-9454-9b7909ee9334,29e3bf6a-98f7-50a1-8756-0deeae6330e7","pathTokens":["USA","California","Northeast California","Lost Sierra, The","Mill, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":3,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":3,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.3"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":17,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":10,"advanced":5,"expert":1}},"sport":{"total":7,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":13,"advanced":11,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.72595,40.1927]},"bbox":[-121.72653865424722,40.192250339818145,-121.7253613457528,40.193149660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109318878","area_id":"KeO/apj3UKGHVg3urmMw5w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":26,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:23.022Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:05.645Z"}
