Pull some shrubs from the crack and pray your footholds don't break until you pull onto the ledge with a single bolt.\n\nHere you are rewarded with a fantastic finger crack with perfect locks to a ledge.

If you touch one of these and send the pile trundling down you may kill your belayer. The anchor is indeed old but looked solid enough to rap from.\n\nA smarter, and more enjoyable way to climb this route would be to skip the choss and traverse right to the tiny bubbles anchor.","protection":"Wide gear to 5.
