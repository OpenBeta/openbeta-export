Shasta Area Rock Climbing\" that has proven more than useful. This route was one of the best I had done in the area. It was exposed, scenic, a mix of shade and sun. And some of the scariest rock I have climbed on(though nothing blew out or fell so that was nice)\n\nthe route starts out with a few exposed moves on pretty solid rock, which was nice because the first placement was 15 feet up. shortly after that you get to a belay next to a small tree. next pitch works up a large slab and through some loose rock to a good area for a cam nest. next is the no reverse traverse which felt about 5.6 or 5.5 which came as a surprise because most guide books said 5.0(perhaps we were off route)the next pitch was on a giant flake that at the top started to flex. with some more climbing and chimneying you gain a nice ledge. next pitch starts off straight forward but moves into a well protected crux that felt about 5.9 the next pitch is a simple but long route to the castle dome summit","protection":"a full alpine rack to 4\" was fully utilized. there were no bolt anchors but the crux had two closely spaced bolts for good protection","location":"the route can be found by approaching castle dome via the dome trail. once at the dome head north down a narrow  gully about 400-500 feet long. descend the gully to the end where it drops off suddenly and you will see a dike on your right just opposite of a big tree. that is the start of the first pitch. Descend via the SE \"walk-off\" don't be ashamed to rope up for descent as the exposure can be quite interesting."},"__v":0},{"_id":"KJ1YM1AeXtue18hagzQ9vA==","name":"North Face - Castle Dome","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Lincoln Freese, 1977","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.32717,41.17479]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105735386","mp_crag_id":"105734306","climb_id":"KJ1YM1AeXtue18hagzQ9vA==","areaRef":"0cjuPCMTXpW2N7Tq1nx79w=="},"content":{"description":"From the castle dome obsevation deck (recognizable because of the poles pounded into the rock), West Ridge and North Face are dirctly across you on the back of the dome.  West Ridge ascends the opposite face and North Face faces a little further left than the dect.\n\nTo reach the start of both climbs (same first pitch) hike down right of the observation deck, then down the gully beneath the deck until you reach a fir tree with a sling around it.  The climbs begin by ascending the dike dirctly across from the tree.\n\nP1 (5.8) - Up the dike for 15 feet then up and right on the not-steep slab just east of the actual west ridge.  Belay at the small trees.\n\nP2 (5.9) - Continue up the slab and then to the left-facing dihedral.  Pro is good in the dihedral's crack. Belay from the tree a little left of the dihedral's top.  Be careful not to knock rocks down from the belay - they end up at the first belay spot.\n\nP3 (5.7) - There are two options for this pitch.  The 5.7 option involves moving straight left on a ledge to the next set of small trees, then up an easy face to another ledge.\n\n(5.9?) - It is also possible to directly ascend the off-width-looking cracks directly above the second belay station.  More work though.\n\nP4 (5.9) - If you took the 5.7 pitch, you need to traverse right on the somewhat narrow ledge to the dihedrals, then up them to the numerous spires atop them, where you set up an easy belay.  If your P3 was the off-width, you need not traverse right much at all.\n\nP5 (5.9) - Follow two big flakes upwards, then traverse across a nearly vertical face to a comfortable ledge from where you belay.\n\nP6 (5.8 C0 or 5.10) - Proceed up and left following a flake from the belay ledge.  When the flake ends you'll find 3 bolts on the face.  The upper two bolts are for the pendulum.  Regardless of how you chose to get across the nearly blank face, you wind up left of it on another flake.  Follow this to a ledge with a bush on it.  Stay low to avoid the bush and proceed further left on the ledge until you find a ~5.4 ramp up and to the right.  Belay from the tree above the left side of the pendulum.\n\nP7 (5.9) - Start climbing directly above the tree and head up and slightly right until you intersect a dike going up and left.  The crux is near the top, then you're done!","protection":"A standard rack will pretty easily take you to the top of the climb.  Mostly cracks until the 6th pitch where you can pendulum across a nearly blank face, or you can free at at '10.b' (not so sure I agree).  The 2 bolts from which you pendulum are only 1/4 inch, so that's a little unnerving.  Further, it may be best not to place any pro on lead after you complete the pendulum.  You'll belay from the tree above the finish of the pendulum and the climbing up to the tree is only 5.5 or so.\n\nThe 7th pitch might be a little harder to protect because it ascends a dike and there are no constant cracks and no bolts.  Fortunately, the crux of the 7th pitch is well-protected.\n\nTo descend, walk off the back-left and there are stairs down the dome.  If you don't see the stairs, look for an easier way (or go for it...).","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"q9AJJT4HXqyk6EnosMuv5A==","name":"The Dike Route (aka East Face)","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"John Bald et al.","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.32717,41.17479]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105736315","mp_crag_id":"105734306","climb_id":"q9AJJT4HXqyk6EnosMuv5A==","areaRef":"0cjuPCMTXpW2N7Tq1nx79w=="},"content":{"description":"The route climbs on or near a dike for 1100 feet of well featured face climbing.
