Easy slab past old bolt to cluster of poorish cams under 1st roof, this is probably the mental crux. Then slab to second roof and red camelot to hardish move past a bolt (replaced) to pull onto dyke proper. One more old bolt to 2bolt belay (replaced)..  needs a 60m rope.\n\n3rd pitch starts off good on the dyke, Then steps round R into a dirty gully to loose all exposure. Not particularly inspiring and feels pointlessly dangerous, with many good stances to drill, but no bolts and dirty/sandy. Not like a Tuolume R which is way awesome! a 5.10 leader might whitey :)\n\nOnly 3 bits of gear that will hold. Purple Camelot off the belay, RP3 at the Crux step right and a green alien.\n\n4th pitch shite. Step L on chossy wall/chimney. Apparently a bolt somewhere??\n\nBest to bail after pitch 2 IMO! Bolts are home made and rubbish! I replaced pitch 2+3 anchors with fixe ss 10mm and crux bolt pitch2.\n\nUK E3+ 5c for those interested.","protection":"I rebolted all anchors with fixe ss 3.5x 3/8ths and replaced the crux bolt on pitch 2 passing the 2nd roof to gain the dyke","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"/rSFyQATVl2wj/m3n6nYbg==","name":"Golden Opportunity","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.33692,41.17689]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"113003854","mp_crag_id":"105734405","climb_id":"/rSFyQATVl2wj/m3n6nYbg==","areaRef":"vBamGq9IVQSCwk+e49+bag=="},"content":{"description":"Good alternative for initial pitches of Cosmic Wall.\n\nStart on the climber's right hand side of The Ogre, approximately at the level of P1 of Cosmic.
