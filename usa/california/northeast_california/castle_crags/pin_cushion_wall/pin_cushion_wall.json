It is further left than the picture in the guidebook would indicate, and the first bolt is about 20 feet off the deck.\n\nThe first pitch is less-than-vertical face climbing on good granite.\n\nThe second pitch is a one move wonder that involves getting over a steep bulge with rock on three sides.\n\nWalking off is very simple.  Head back and right and you'll find a little climbers trail that leads you back to Newspaper Ledge and down.","protection":"Three bolts to a two bolt anchor above the first pitch (~140 ft).  You can (and probably should) supplement the bolts with slings, cams and/or nuts.\n\nOne way to get off the rock once you've finished the first pitch (and the only part mentioned in the guide book) is to continue upwards (one ~5.8+ move) using the obvious crack for pro.  Placements are quite nice.\n\nIf you don't want to continue upwards, you could bring up two ropes and rap off.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,1a8ca51c-5dce-508c-9059-0720ba2e4f13,cba43ca5-30d4-5f49-9611-7e0d3da26b51,696ad51d-c1e4-5e48-9d39-09ffd0bb727e","pathTokens":["USA","California","Northeast California","Castle Crags","Pin Cushion Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.32705,41.17]},"bbox":[-122.32764734890831,41.169550339818144,-122.32645265109171,41.170449660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105734309","area_id":"aWrVHcHkXkidOQn/0Ltyfg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-122.32764734890831,41.169550339818144],[-122.32645265109171,41.169550339818144],[-122.32645265109171,41.170449660181866],[-122.32764734890831,41.170449660181866],[-122.32764734890831,41.169550339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:05.710Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:05.180Z"}
