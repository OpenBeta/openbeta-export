Side pulls and small dishes will get you to some big reaches you'll have to pull through to gain the lower angle part of the boulder about 10 fet off the ground. Delicate footwork on a seemingly holdless face will give way to a horrizontal crack. Once you reach the crack, you'll have to do a lock off while toeing in on the crack to reach up to a less than stellar hold. Pull up delicately and stand on the crack before reaching better holds at the top. Sketchy! You can always bail off to the left if things get too puckery.","protection":"Nothings going to save you if you blow the top.","location":"Far Right arete and face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,1a8ca51c-5dce-508c-9059-0720ba2e4f13,9806ec01-abae-5415-9c82-0dfa4c2c92cd,9c10ca47-0713-52a8-ac83-6c0fa1ee1a54,f1f24cf6-fc47-5dd3-b883-4bd740977ac0,46e665cc-893f-5d19-8928-0d3f15e22621","pathTokens":["USA","California","Northeast California","Doyle Area","West Face, The","Pinkland","Fear Machine Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"V2"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.01703,40.00565]},"bbox":[-120.01761703825616,40.00520033981814,-120.01644296174383,40.00609966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118041559","area_id":"RuZlzIk/XRmJKA0/FeImIQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-120.01761703825616,40.00520033981814],[-120.01644296174383,40.00520033981814],[-120.01644296174383,40.00609966018186],[-120.01761703825616,40.00609966018186],[-120.01761703825616,40.00520033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:23.640Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:16.132Z"}
