This joins Casaval at about 9,800 ft. Follow this ridge to the base of Misery Hill and then to the top.\n\nDescent via West Face Gully or Avalanche Gulch is the easiest choice for parties doing this without setting up a base camp. Otherwise, descend back down the route (this is the safer choice during high avalanche danger as well)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,1a8ca51c-5dce-508c-9059-0720ba2e4f13,a842060d-cebb-503d-925b-8cdb8414dfd0,70d3eb13-4c5d-53fc-ae5c-7a8d7379939f","pathTokens":["USA","California","Northeast California","Mount Shasta Area","Mt.
