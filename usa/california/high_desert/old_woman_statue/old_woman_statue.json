Locate a two bolt anchor and belay the second from this anchor. Directly above this set of anchors is an A1 bolt laddder. There are 12 bolts in all, mostly 1/4\" thread bolts and buttonheads, with the occasional 3/8\" to keep it safe yet sporty. Climb this bolt ladder to the summit (30'), where a two bolt anchor with rap chains are located. Fix the line to the anchors for the second to jug. Near the anchor is a pile of rocks that secures the summit register (courtesy of Greg Vernon, placed in Feb 2000). A single rope rappel WILL make it back down to the notch, at the base of the route.\n\nAs a side note, this location seems to channel most of the wind passing over the ridge and can be a very chilly location when climbing in the winter and early spring (bring warm clothes!!).","protection":"Key equipment:\n\n- small to medium nuts\n\n- cams to 1\"\n\n- 24 oval carabiners\n\n- two sets of etriers\n\n- a set of jumars\n\n- (1) 60 meter rope\n\n- And a cool head!","location":"As described for the approach to the notch of Old Woman Statue, scramble up 3rd class terrain via chockstone in a large crack and onto short ledges around the norhtwestern shoulder of Old Woman's base. Scramble to a notch above. The notch is ideal location for the intial belay and start of The North Face. Next to the notch is a near vertical left-facing corner crack (roughly 30'). This is the start of the route, which eventually leads to the summit."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,28adfed8-aba2-59bd-9d58-e3e1cf22b6f8,fd36f00f-d9b4-5857-8668-057203611e71","pathTokens":["USA","California","High Desert","Old Woman Statue"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1649,34.5216]},"bbox":[-115.16544576199209,34.52115033981814,-115.16435423800792,34.522049660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106088113","area_id":"/TbwD9m0WFeGaAVyA2EecQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:33.577Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:28.255Z"}
