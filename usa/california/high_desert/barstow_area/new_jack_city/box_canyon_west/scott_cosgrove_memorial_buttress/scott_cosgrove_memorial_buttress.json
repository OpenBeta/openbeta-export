A pure power endurance route on mostly positive holds. No tricks or gimmicks like other hard routes at New Jack. The route is sustained at the V4 to V5 level with a few semi-rests along the way. The hardest single move is probably clipping and moving past the 3rd bolt. However, the upper half of the route has a couple distinct boulder problems thrown in back-to-back and finishes with some small sequential holds that turn on the pump-factor and provide for the redpoint crux.","protection":"All fixed chain draws, including the anchor.
