Â The route then has three possible variations.\n\nLeft features a rather uncomfortable offwidth crack feature.\n\nMiddle features a likely 5.10B move through a relatively featureless face. Approach the small car sized boulder miraculously still attached to the face with caution.\n\nRight features some juggier face climbing, a likely escape for those who cant climb the intended line.\n\nAfter completing either variation, the face begins to slightly level out with a pick your own adventure scramble to the top.\n\nBolted anchor chains at the top.","protection":"Fixed Chain Anchors, 60m rope or more recommended, but a 50m may work if the belayer stands uphill a ways.","location":"Depending on approach, the route is located on the left side (East) of the Lion's Den when facing it from below.
