Crux can be well-protected and is about 50 feet off the deck, both sides of the dihedral force you to make several friction moves before you get back to some jugs. Finish up with some grimy offwidth climbing or stem by using the bulge left of the dihedral.","protection":"Protection is as good as you make it, and would highly recommend 2 size 4, 5, and 6 Camalots along with a standard rack, as the offwidth can be extremely runout if you don’t have the larger cam sizes. Anchor is one of two chock boulders, one on the left and a smaller one on the route.","location":"Scramble up the low 5th class climbing to a large ledge for you and your belayer, about 25 feet.
