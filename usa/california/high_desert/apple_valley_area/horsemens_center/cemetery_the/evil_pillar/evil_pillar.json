This is a very fun easy moderate that climbs mostly on plates.  Start just left of the lesser block in front of Evil Pillar, scrambling up to the right to a ledge between the rocks.  From there, follow the bolt line up past large plates, veering slightly left after the last bolt.  The crux is a delicate section at the second bolt, the one spot where one has to make a couple moves without benefit of the plates.  Even so, probably easier than the listed rating.
