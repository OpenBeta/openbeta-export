You could bring a rope and a few pieces of pro but the rock is loose and can break.  Test your holds!  Not a lot of options to set up a rappel above the 4th class section either.","location":"This peak is 1/2 mile NE of Dove. Approach as for Dove but once you are below Dove's west face continue NE over a small rise and head for the small cave at the base of North Castle's west face.  There is a decent use trail in this area if you can find it."},"__v":0},{"_id":"d62BKiNXViiUDOB+EU6yPw==","name":"Dove Benchmark","yds":"Easy 5th","grades":{"yds":"Easy 5th","french":"1+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.1615,35.3695]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106156367","mp_crag_id":"106156364","climb_id":"d62BKiNXViiUDOB+EU6yPw==","areaRef":"G3sIiPq2WkaLfz26AYTeuA=="},"content":{"description":"This is not a destination rock climb. Any normal person would not complete this approach in order to climb 30 feet of junk rock. But the setting is truly sublime and the views from the peak are incredible.\n\nClimb the open book for 30 feet. Belay at a fixed sling anchor. Scramble another fifty feet to the summit.\n\nApparently there used to be a USGS benchmark labeled \"Dove\" on this summit. It's gone now, replaced by a reference mark labeled \"NQ 2\".\n\nRappel 30 feet from the anchor.","protection":"The rock quality is pretty poor so any protection placed is questionable. The route is short enough that only a few pieces are useful. Gear: single rack #0.75 - #3 cams and a set of nuts. One 60 foot (20 meter) rope for rappel.","location":"From the parking area on the dirt road where the Wilderness Area boundary is marked by a barricade, continue following the northbound jeep track on foot. Follow the track to a saddle from which point the crags are clearly visible. Continue following the wandering track until you get as close as your going to get to the west side of the crags. Leave the trail and travel cross country up the western gully between the crags to the south side of Dove.\n\nOnce at the saddle, third class your way up the crag until you get to the summit block.
