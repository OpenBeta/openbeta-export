It may be worth checking with the rangers in the gift shop that it's OK to do this, though a ranger was supportive of our efforts!\n\nSuspect there are other routes up the same crag which could be done with a bit of tweaking of the same anchor.","protection":"Easy walk to the top of the crag. Bring a long static line to build an anchor from a tree (about 30 foot away) and a big obvious boulder.","location":"There are two paths from the car park to Glacier Point itself - one high, and then a lower disabled route.
