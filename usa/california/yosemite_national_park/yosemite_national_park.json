It is home to some of the most iconic climbs in the world, including The Nose and the Dawn Wall on El Capitan.\n\n## The Nose\n\nAs a climber, you likely already know that Lynn Hill's ascent of The Nose on El Capitan in Yosemite National Park in 1993 was a groundbreaking achievement in climbing. She made history by climbing sections of the route that had previously been considered impossible without aid gear. Her achievement inspired a new generation of climbers and cemented her place as one of the greatest climbers of all time.\n\n## Moderate Climbs\n\nYosemite is also home to a variety of moderate climbs, including Swan Slab and The Grack. These climbs offer a more accessible and less challenging experience for climbers who are not yet ready for the more difficult routes in the park.\n\n## Camp 4\n\nCamp 4 is the historic campground that has been a hub for climbers since the 1950s. This is where many famous climbers, including Royal Robbins, Yvon Chouinard, and Lynn Hill, started their climbing careers. Camp 4 is a great place to meet other climbers and find partners for climbs.\n\n## Speed Records\n\nSpeed climbing is also a popular pursuit in Yosemite Valley, with climbers attempting to set records on the park's most iconic routes. In 2017, Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell set a new speed record on The Nose, climbing the route in an astonishing 1 hour and 58 minutes.\n\n## Tulumne Meadows\n\nTulumne Meadows is another popular area in Yosemite for climbers, with a range of trad and sport climbs available. This area is known for its high-altitude climbs and stunning alpine scenery.\n\n## Bears\n\nIn addition to its incredible climbs, Yosemite is also known for its population of black bears. Climbers must take precautions to avoid attracting bears by storing food and other scented items in bear-proof containers and not cooking or eating in or near climbing areas. Climbers should also be prepared to encounter bears on the approach or descent of climbs and know how to respond in case of an encounter.\n\n*created by ChatGPT*"},"density":0.026701859188313668,"totalClimbs":2387,"__v":3,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:33.577Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:11:24.683Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"63ee79098da152d5a9ac13a0","prevHistoryId":"63ee78fd8da152d5a9ac1386","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"updatedBy":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw=="}
