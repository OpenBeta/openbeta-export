You will use face climbing, possibly a mantel, fingerlocks/ringlocks, awesome handjams and fists. Start on the large flake near the middle of the wall and work your way on it via a strenuous mantel or a long reach up and left. The lip on the flake is intermittent, so work out your sequence! Then follow the finger crack above to where it meets a horizontal crack. Another finger crack continues up, slightly further right - you gain that with a semi-blind reach. Follow the new finger crack till it meets a horizontal hand crack above. Now make a long traverse right with your hands in a sumptious hand crack (a little dirty, but good) and good feet. You will meet a short, vertical hand crack directly below the anchor, which widens near the top.","protection":"On toprope, there is big pendulum potential on this route. The swing is \"clean\", but could be unnerving for some. If there are two of you, get your belayer to pay out a bunch of slack if you swing out to dampen the swing. If there are more than two, tie into the middle of the rope and set up a second belay with your rope end off to the left to stop the swing.\n\nIf leading, bring protection between 0.5\"-3\".","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"07KAuNTbVMS+n3T98/S1FQ==","name":"Finger Crack","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.80446,37.9221]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"110648065","mp_crag_id":"107751681","climb_id":"07KAuNTbVMS+n3T98/S1FQ==","areaRef":"4hD3cQBGWs2JUV2hzQ8Sww=="},"content":{"description":"Steep finger crack - start off the ground isnt too bad with some bigger pockets you can really sink your fingers into but quickly steepens and feet become more precarious.
