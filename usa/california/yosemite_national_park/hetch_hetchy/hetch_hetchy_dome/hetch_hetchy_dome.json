Once you make it through this, a small ledge allows a rest before the thin, technical, well protected crux of stemming and face climbing. Awesome position and climbing!\n\nP. 16...It's not over! I recalled belaying at the optional belay (see topo). This is also the rap descent\n\nP. 17, 18 wander up and right.\n\nAt the summit, walk west (left) to the first of the raps. Rap the route. Or walk off.","protection":"Apparently pro to 6\", though Sean and I didn't bring anything bigger than a 4.\n\nA handful of alpine slings.\n\nA half dozen or so draws.\n\nAn 80m allows you to rap the route (maybe even a 70m).","location":"The start is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAs you hike out to the route, keep an eye out for the large dihedral system of pitches 3-6. The route starts down and right of this (see topo).\n\nThe excellent topo is provided by Chris Williams and Jim Treggiari, without which, this route may have faded to obscurity.
