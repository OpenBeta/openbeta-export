All anchors bolted\n\nP1 - 11c (did something break?) - Head up the bolted line in the space between the \"inverted\" flake. Cool knob climbing with a move I couldn't pull getting past the 3rd bolt. Unlike the rest of the route, you can pull through this crux. At the 4th bolt, go left into the chimney. Wild and hard. There's another bolt in the chimney and then bust out of the flake/roof at the apex, really wild. Good and engaging climbing to the anchor. 11 bolts\n\nP2 - 11b - This one actually felt true to the grade. Head up then straight right friction (crux) climbing past two bolts. Then head up into a shallow corner that is harder than it looks. Easy climbing up and left to the anchor. 8 bolts\n\nP3 - 11a (yeah right) - 2 bolts gets you to a flake/thin crack and then up to an arete. Clip a bolt above the roof and then move left into a chimney. Up this for 15ft. til you can reach back right around the arete and clip another bolt. Hard moves lead around then up the arete. Getting to the next bolt is hard/far and the fall is kinda weird. Crazy and sustained arete moves to the anchor. I think the chimney is part of \"capital punishment\" and i'm sure you can take it to the top if you want\n\nP4 - Easy to the top","protection":"All bolted but take a thin fingers size piece for P3 if you want (recommended)","location":"For the most fun, find the top of the route which is in a nice flat spot (10 min. walk) and rap in. I'm pretty sure a single 70m can make it. You'll probably want to take your shoes in case you have to bail and walk out (a real possibility for most I would think).\n\nOtherwise, follow the approach directions to the base of the cliff. The first pitch is in the very peculiar flake thing."},"__v":0},{"_id":"Oo0qu48zWwidW08Hp6Sibw==","name":"Hobknob","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"George Meyers, Merrill Wilson (Oct '86)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.72059,37.71881]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"110302898","mp_crag_id":"106613455","climb_id":"Oo0qu48zWwidW08Hp6Sibw==","areaRef":"6jMptec0U+aGlNtg7qS41g=="},"content":{"description":"Bolted face just to the right of Corn Corner. The bolts have been recently replaced and are in good shape. The rock is somewhat flaky and the climb isn't very sustained, but if you like knob climbs it's worth doing.\n\nP1 - Scramble up to a little shelf above a pine tree and place some pro in a thin crack. Wander out right to a bolt then back left through a little bulge. Either belay at a bolted anchor or link with the next pitch.\n\nP2 - Follow bolts up the face with big knobs and belay at a large ledge with bushes/trees. You can rap from here, or walk off to the right if you're planning on returning to the base of the wall for another climb. The upper pitches aren't very good and are only worth it if you're climbing back up to the road.\n\nP3&4 - Either climb up the dirty crack above the ledge (5.7) or solo easy knobs off to the left (5.6 R/X). Soon the angle kicks back to 4th class. The belay options aren't great, either traverse over to trees in the gully to the right, or simul to the top. Watch out because the slab has a lot of loose sand and lichen on it.","protection":"Pro to 2\", mostly bolt protected.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"1yLl39NMWcCWvdUheKXP6g==","name":"Corn Corner","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Bob Ashworth et al, 1970's","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.72059,37.71881]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106613468","mp_crag_id":"106613455","climb_id":"1yLl39NMWcCWvdUheKXP6g==","areaRef":"6jMptec0U+aGlNtg7qS41g=="},"content":{"description":"This is a good corner climb with some loose rock at the bottom and some hollow sections in the middle.
