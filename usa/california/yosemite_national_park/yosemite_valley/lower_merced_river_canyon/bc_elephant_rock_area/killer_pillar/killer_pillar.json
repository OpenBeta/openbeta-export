It's also quite an excellent climb by it's own merits. It climbs the face on the left side of the Pillar and gets shade most of the day, including afternoon when the rest of the routes have gone into the sun. Good for running laps on at the end of the day.\n\nThe only fault with the route is the bolt line sometimes feels a bit forced, with easier climbing off to the left. It also doesn't feel quite as exposed as the other Pillar routes since it stands above a gully, rather than slabs.
