It will test your crack technique at all sizes from thin hands to squeeze chimney and requires a bit of a hefty rack if you want to sew it up.\n\nPitch 1 starts just to the right of the 11c thin crack/seam \"Rocket In My Pocket\". For the first 30ft you have two options. A squeeze chimney on the left, or a hand crack and knobs just to the right. Neither way is difficult. This will lead to the base of a 5.7 offwidth.

Monkey through the tree and follow easy cracks up and left to a large ledge.\n\nPitch 2 we did as a real rope-stretcher. Again there are a couple different ways to start. The goal is to reach the obvious arching thin-hands splitter on the face just above. A direct approach is somewhat difficult and perhaps not that well protected. I chose to climb up a corner around to the right and then downclimb an easy ramp back down to the left. I did all this without placing pro so I could flip the rope around the corner and had my second follow up the direct start.\n\nThe thin hand crack is the crux, and how cruxy it is will depend on the size of your hands. It's over quickly in any case. Follow a left facing corner until you near the roof and then traverse over to the right (try to traverse low). A hanging belay could perhaps be established below the roof if you want to reduce rope drag. Above the roof is a nice splitter that quickly widens from hands to offwidth (10a/b) and then squeeze chimney. There is a nice bolted belay at a stance out on the arete to the right, near the top of the chimney. This gives you the cleanest rappel. Otherwise continue all the way to the top of Steppin' Out (which will make it a 70m pitch if you start from the big ledge atop \"pitch 1\").\n\nTo descend, rappel with two ropes. It is possible to rappel Steppin' Out with one 70m if you stop at a sort of bogus anchor at a dying tree just below the roof.

One that for some reason has hidden itself, escaping the eye for decades.  A line that reveals itself only when it chooses.  Dream easy is one such line.\n\nThe climb consists of vertical cracks connected by sections of knobs, and face while maintaining a moderate grade. Most parties will face their greatest difficulties on the face sections leaving the security of a crack system for the insecure edges of a granite face.  Or, some may have difficulty with the short chimney on pitch one.  Those who are able to pull through their own personal cruxes and continue upward will be rewarded with an enjoyable four pitch climb that gains good elevation, and ends up a headwall.\n\nPitch 1) Ascend a short section of knobs without pro (5.8) until a left slanting ledge system is reached.  Climb this ledge and head straight into a short yet ominous chimney.  Easy stemming with good pro will lead you up the chimney until further upward progress is seemingly impossible.  The trick here is to not get stuck deep inside the chimney.  Back out to the edge of the chimney and find a huge jug up and left.  Use this jug to exit the chimney (5.7) and mantle the chock stones that make up the stance for the belay at the bottom of the second pitch.  Belay on gear 2-4 inches.\n\nPitch 2) Stem and mantle a chock stone directly off the belay and continue up the left slanting ledge system.  Keep your eyes out for a small dike angling up and to the right out on the face.  Traverse this dike passing a bolt.  When the dike ends, connect together thin face moves up toward a tree (5.8).  Traverse the top of a wide flake to the right crossing the top anchors of Duck for Cover.  When the flake runs out, climb a low angle face past two bolts (5.8) to a rounded horn and a gear belay.\n\nPitch 3) Climb straight up a nice hand crack (5.7).  Before the crack peters out, switch cracks to the left by using knobs (5.7).  Gain the discontinuous crack and climb up past shaky gear to a lower angle section of high quality crack.  Follow this wonderful section of hand jams as the crack angles up and to the right.  Belay at a small stance from bolts.\n\nPitch 4) The money pitch.  From the belay, step right and into a crack system with intermittent sections of hummock.  Climb up this section until a passage to the right seems possible.  Climb a little higher to find pro, then down climb and traverse the easy, low angle, high quality face.  Gain the crack out right and climb up until good pro is found.  Make a thin move left (5.8) and climb the steep, clean crack up into the headwall.  An excellent lieback (5.8) past a bulge will lead you to the left and the bolted anchor.\n\nDecent:  From the top of pitch 4, make a double rope rappel back to the top of pitch 3.  From the top of pitch 3, make a double rope rappel down a steep section to the top of a chimney.  From the top of the chimney, rappel off bots with two ropes to the ground.

Starting from the Direct route is probably the more classic option.\n\nThe chimney is straightforward for the most part. You can follow the inside of the Reed's Direct crack for a ways, but eventually you need to traverse left because the top of the chimney is capped by a bunch of chockstones.

Good climb to do during Fall and Winter months. If it has not rained or snowed for over a week, there is a good chance the route will be easily climbable. Since it is only seven pitches, it does not require an alpine start. The protection is adequate and quality of climbing is really good. The 11c crux could be easily aided with a few tiny cams. A nice addition to the area.\n\nPitch 1: 150 ft 5.10c: The super classic Lunatic Fringe. Climb a right leaning hand-crack for about 25 feet and continue up to double cracks. Do a reachy transition from left to right (crux for many) and continue up. It varies from thin to perfect hands and after a wide pod becomes thin for a few moves. Fortunately the thin sections are not very sustained and there are good stances to place gear. As the crack narrows down make a step left to a jug.\n\nPitch 2: 80 ft 5.10c: From a bolted belay step left into a thin crack and stem/jam through most difficulties. Thank yourself for bringing a 0 and 00 C3 piece, or something else that fits. Delicate moves take you to a flexing thank god jug. Few more cruxy moves bring you to easier ground. This pitch is pretty fun and delicate. Easier face climbing take you up and left, past a tree, to another bolted belay.\n\nPitch 3: 160 ft 5.9: Step left and around a corner to a right leaning handcrack in a corner. It is not long and you pass a big grassy ledge before reaching another system. Great crack in a corner on the left, and another good looking one just to the right. I took the left crack and loved it. Continue past another ledge and up a short chimney with a crack in the back.\n\nPitch 4: 170 ft 5.10c: Make a few committing moves to the top of a good knob and clip a first bolt. Continue up clipping a few more till holds disappear for a few moves (crux). Friction up and left to an arête and pass a roof. I traversed the roof from left to right. Continue up easier knobs and do a few more difficult moves till you reach the belay (bolted).\n\nPitch 5: 180ft 5.10b: From the belay step right and up an arete. You can either sling the knobs for pro or place gear in a right facing corner around. Sling a knob above the roof and figure out the sequence to the top of this knob (crux). Don't knock your sling off the knob in the process, like I did. Easier climbing takes you past a few more knobs and a piton. Clip another bolt before an easier roof and climb pretty much straight up a sea of knobs to another bolted belay.\n\nPitch 6: 130 ft 5.11c: Climb up from the belay towards a left leaning underling. Traverse under it and get into a chimney. Stem out of the flare to pass a roof into a traversing edge. Crank through this not so juggy section and onto a good ledge. Shake out and prepare yourself for first knuckle jamming, stemming and lie backing up a left facing corner (crux). FFA was done with it wet and it was rated 5.11c. Seemed like a 5.11b when dry. Thin gear is really nice to have here. After you are done with the crux continue left under an overhang. Watch your feet and don't slip on the munge.\n\nPitch 7: 90 ft 510.d/5.11a. From the belay climb over an overhang and establish yourself on a knob from which you can clip the first bolt. Mantle to the top of the bolt and clip another one. Last cruxy move will put you above the difficulties. Make a small traverse left to a pod and mantle up to easy slab. Don't fall here and hike up to a tree with rap slings. If you intend on going to the top bring some more webbing to back up the slings that by now been roughed up by the animals. Or at least back up the anchor for the first (hopefully heavier) person to rappel. Enjoy the views from the top of Reed's and get down in time to buy some beer, or prune juice.\n\nDESCENT: Two 60 M ropes. Rappell the route. Webbing on top of the formation might be damaged by animals, so bringing some extra might be nice.","protection":"Standard rack up to BD #2. 0 and 00 C3s are useful.
