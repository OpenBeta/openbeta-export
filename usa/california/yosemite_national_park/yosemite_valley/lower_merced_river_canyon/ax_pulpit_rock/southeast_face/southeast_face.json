Head up the steep gully until you see a zig-zag crack about 15 feet downhill from a cedar tree. The route starts here. Climb the crack for approximately 25 feet until you reach the bottom of a left-leaning dihedral. Don't climb this dihedral. Instead, traverse right on edges, then face climb up through flakes and edges into an alcove below an eye-shaped roof. 5.9.\n\nPitch 2) Climb straight up into an overhang and traverse a clean, splitter, finger crack to the left. Pull the roof crack (.9) and climb up to a large ledge with a tree on it.\n\nPitch 3) From the tree, pull edges (.7) to gain a slab that takes you to the top.\n\nThis climb could be done in one pitch but the rope drag would be bad on the final slab.

It's not quite as good as The Sermon, but is perhaps the next best route to the summit.\n\nOn the right end of the east face you will see a super obvious arching jam crack near the arete. This beautiful splitter is gained via a traverse in from the left. Start the same as Original Sin (10c steep groove), but about 20 ft up, traverse 15ft across the face to the right to get under the crack. Be mindful of how you place and extend your gear for the traverse or you'll pay with major rope drag later on. After another body-length of face climbing you gain the handcrack which passes through a small roof, then turns from fists to offwidth as it arches to the left. There are a couple slung chockstones, but you'll also want a couple larger cams for this section. Belay on a large ledge.\n\nThe second pitch moves to the left and up a short steep corner (5.6) with juggy flakes.
