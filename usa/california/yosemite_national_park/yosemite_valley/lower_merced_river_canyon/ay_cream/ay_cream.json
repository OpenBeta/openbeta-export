While it's definitely shorter, I thought it was just as burly. Just past Cream is another large corner system with a splitter up the face to the right of this. The climb starts with hand jams and widens to squeeze chimney. The crux is a 4.5\" in section below the ledge in the middle. I'm pretty sure it's best done as a lieback. Above the ledge the crack is wider and much more difficult to protect with conventional gear. There are a couple places for a super tipped-out #6 Camalot in constrictions, but you will need big bros or valley giants to adequately protect the upper 40' of the climb. Larger people will feel especially exposed at an \"S-curve\" high on the route.

Imagine\n\nChingando\n\n, but 20 degrees steeper. It's also probably among the easiest of the 5.11 wide cracks if you are looking to break into the grade.\n\nThis will be the first obvious climb you come to as you traverse the base of the cliff from the \"Eastern Square Cleft\" approach gully. It is on the steep right-hand face of a large open book. Blocky 5th class climbing leads to a stance at the bottom of the splitter. The crux comes at you pretty quick on a section that is gently overhanging. Higher up you will pass a small roof and the angle lessens. Conserve your gear because the climb is longer than it looks. I found the route fairly secure but burly and sustained the whole way, with almost no climbing easier than 5.9. Also consider bringing extra webbing for the anchor. The bolts are new but the webbing connecting the rap rings could use replacing. There's a chance a 70m rope might get you down, but I'm not sure.","protection":"I brought three #4 Camalots, two #5 Camalots, and two #6 Camalots and placed all of it, plus a couple hand sized pieces at the start.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,14a34046-d4ba-5064-b505-92d1514f96b6,5a18b040-38fa-5e98-a429-0348e1eae84f","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Lower Merced River Canyon","Ay.
