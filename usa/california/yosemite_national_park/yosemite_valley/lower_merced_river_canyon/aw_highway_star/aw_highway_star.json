Start on either side of the triangular flake (left side is easy but sparse pro) up to a finger crack. Work left and crank through a small roof (crux). Continue up splitter hand crack (have those gold camalots ready!), make a fun move right, and continue up to the top. Belay from tree.\n\nWalk off left.\n\nIf not up for leading, it would be easy to rig a top-rope off a tree by scrambling up and left from the base of the route.\n\nThere is also a fun 10b variation that can be led or top-roped. From the base, climb the left side of the triangular flake, traversing left and then back right around a flake resembling the state of Texas. After working back to the right, join up with the main route. If top-roping, a directional is recommended to prevent a big swing from the left end of the \"Texas flake\".","protection":"Single rack to 3\" (blue Camalot), plus extras in the 2\" (gold Camalot) range.","location":"See area description."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,14a34046-d4ba-5064-b505-92d1514f96b6,04e1fddf-c481-5780-be26-2d7ee9be0b67","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Lower Merced River Canyon","Aw.
