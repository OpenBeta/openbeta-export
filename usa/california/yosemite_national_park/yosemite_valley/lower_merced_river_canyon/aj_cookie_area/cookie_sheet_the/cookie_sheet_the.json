It is possibly the longest on the wall, reaching the highest point on the slab over on the right side.

The second pitch is hard for 20 ft right off the belay and has a tenuous clip at the first bolt. Have your belayer hanging out to the left so you don't fall on their head if you blow it. After that it's more cruising up to another anchor.

This intermediate anchor also allows you to rap with one rope, or set up a toprope on the first 90'.\n\nI found the climb to be pretty sustained and one of the harder ones we did at the Cookie Sheet.
