After the no hands continue up to an overhanging off-fingers splitter (5.11) that will test your endurance to the bolted belay.

Not well known because it was not in the \"select\" guides but as good as any in the Park.

Patiently work in some wires then fire some thin locks to where the crack opens up a bit. Sustained but lowish angle fingers from there to a fixed anchor (bolts). Modern sticky shoes that work in thin cracks make this easier than the original 5.10d rating, imo.\n\nA perfect splitter as good as any in the park and must do on the Yose fingers circuit.
