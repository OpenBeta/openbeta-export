Despite some early seasonal wetness on the second pitch of Maxine's Wall (5.8) this route takes a not at first obvious line with remarkably high quality climbing. Not quite SoY/Serenity quality but still very good and all the pitches except one have some 5.10 climbing for a sustained moderate. Where it needs bolts its pretty tightly bolted but a standard rack is needed for long crack sections too or for the occasional mid-pitch piece. A modern \"Sprad\" route (Type I Fun) and worthy alternative if Serenity Crack or Sons of Yesterday is the usual cluster.\n\nIt also completes a memorial for the indigenous people of Yosemite, the Awahneechee, for whom the buttress is named. Routes on Awahnee Buttress including Sons of Yesterday (Sons of Chief Tenaya Memorial Route), Daughter's Direct, Mother of the Future and Tenaya's Tears are all commentaries on the fate of the original inhabitants of the magnificent Valley of the Yosemite whose former home is now our playground.\n\nThe pitches break down as follows:\n\n1. Sustained 5.10 edging. Basically a better pro'd pitch similar to the first pitch of Fire Fingers. PG13 to clip second bolt and the belayer needs maximum attention here. Belay at Maxine's anchors. Might be the sustained crux but can be avoided by doing the first pitch of Maxine's. 7 bolts.\n\n2. Follow Maxine's second pitch up a seasonally (winter/spring) wet corner (5.8+). Belay at two bolts to the right of the main crack or alternatively, build a gear anchor at the tree below to reduce the cluster at the traverse and make the traverse moves more continuous. This pitch can be linked with the first. Easy to get around the wet if needed and the route gets much better the remaining pitches.\n\n3. Hard slab moves right at the bolted anchor then another well protected hard and thin step across (5.10c) right above the wet streak to \"Mini-Wheat\" an amazing thin flake offering solid small cam pro. At the top of the flake clip a bolt to protect the second then easy climbing up ramps to the right and belay from bolts.\n\n4. Continue in the crack above the belay going straight up when bolts appear (5.9+) to avoid some ugly wide under \"The Ear\". Then continue up a wild arete (save a yellow totem or similar for a crack to protect the end of the arete, 5.10b/c). Rejoin the main corner for some nice stone to the \"Bivy Ledge\". This pitch is called \"Auricle Overpass\".\n\n5. Step right off of the Bivy Ledge clipping bolts. Crux at the second bolt (scrunchy 5.10) reaching right then fun stemming/lay-backing up parallel cracks to a 5.9+ reach up to a crucial lock. One green camalot or similar for pro and easy climbing to the belay. Belay at bolts before a face traverse to the White Corner. \"Changing Corners Lite\". 6 bolts.\n\n6. Friction off the belay (5.10a) to gain the immaculate \"White Corner\" (5.9). Pro can be found (small cams) in a flake to the right before the corner opens up to classic splitter. Belay from Â bolts to the left of the main corner at a ledge or continue on linking 6 and 7. This pitch is PG13 at present right off the belay but only runout on the easier ground. Still, don't fall as a nasty flake below comes into play.\n\n7. Continue up a thin corner/flake to the right of the larger corner (5.10b) to \"Block Ledge\" with bolted anchors. Above this is acres of munge and remains an ongoing project.\n\nRappel the route with 2 ropes (some rappels are mandatory 130') to the top of the third pitch then go straight down using Permanent Wave's anchor to reach the ground in 2 more rappels finishing to the left and right above the Awahnee Cascade stream bed. Walk back around to the base of the route or 3rd Class some easy 5th class chimney moves (careful) up corners directly West to the Serenity ledge system if you left gear there.","protection":"Standard rack. 7 QD/Alpine draws plus wires and doubles on cams to gold Camalot. 2 ropes to rappel as one rap is 40m.","location":"From the Awahnee Hotel parking lot follow the climbers trail and scramble 3rd Class to the ledges at the base of Serenity Crack.
