Unlike most of the nearby routes, Mid-Life Crisis is actually reasonably bolted for someone climbing near their limit. The climb is fairly sustained with all four pitches clocking in at 5.10. Most bolts are two or three body-lengths apart, with a couple big runouts on lower angle terrain. Though very well protected by Valley standards, this is not a sport climb. Be prepared to make cruxy 5.10 moves while standing perhaps 5 ft above your last bolt, and keep it together while runout 40-50 ft on low angle (but blank) 5.8 friction. All bolts and anchors were replaced thanks to the\n\nASCA\n\nand are bomber!\n\nPitch 1: Begin a short ways left of the start of the Arches Terrace Regular Route. A slab boulder problem gains a left facing flake. Climb this and place a couple cams from 1\" to 1.5\". Then step right onto the face and go up to the first bolt. Follow the line of bolts straight up to an anchor. There is a big runout before the last bolt, but the rock is lower angle and there are some good edges and features which keep it reasonable. 6 Bolts.\n\nPitch 2: Traverse left from the anchor to a bolt that's way out left and sort of low. I actually missed this one and ended up angling straight up to the second bolt on the pitch, which is a reasonable runout and will actually reduce your ropedrag greatly on the rest of the pitch. Climb over a small bulge and continue up through some really blank rock that fortunately has good friction. This leads up to another bolted anchor. 7 Bolts.\n\nPitch 3: Climb left into the white water-polished rock. Good edges but bad friction lead up past a couple bolts to a left-facing corner. You can place a small piece here (.25\"). Step right onto the arete and follow it up until you can move further right. More friction climbing continues up to the anchor. 7 Bolts.\n\nPitch 4: Climb straight up to the first bolt and then move left to reach a vertical dike. This leads to a second bolt. Continue along another dike out right and then cut back left. The angle at this point drops off and you make a big runout to the top of the pitch. The bolted anchor you are looking for is located in white rock just below an obvious left-facing corner.\n\nAt this point it is possible to continue climbing for three more pitches on Friday the 13th (5.10b R) which will lead to a tree covered terrace just below the steep headwalls.

If it gets more traffic it will become a lot better. Don't try to climb it in the spring or you'll have to deal with a lot of runoff and slime as well. Late fall is the best time. Also this thing cooks in the sun, so bring plenty of water.\n\nThe route goes mostly free at 13a A0, but some of the 5.10 pitches would be a nightmare to try freeing without first doing some serious gardening. Some of the 5.11 and 5.12 pitches look pretty bold, with small tricky pro placed from bad stances.\n\nErik's Bigwalls guidebook has a solid topo for the route, but here's a quick pitch breakdown.\n\nPitch 1: Short bolt ladder, move right, then up a shallow corner that's really dirty. With a coupe camhook moves you can avoid nailing. C2+\n\nPitch 2: Mostly a bolt ladder up the slab with a couple little cruxes. I think i might have hammered once on this pitch. A2-\n\nPitch 3: Pulled on gear somewhere near the start then free climbed the rest of the pitch. Mostly 5.6 and under.\n\nPitch 4: Free climb up and left, then after a bolt move back right. Some aid on dirty rock, and then at the top of the pitch it looked easier to free than try aiding. Seemed maybe 5.8 or so, with big fall potential if you fuck up. I thought this was the mandatory free crux of the climb. C2\n\nPitch 5: Walk left along Angel Ledge past 1 bolt and then climb up blocky terrain, mixed aid and free. C1+\n\nPitch 6: Climb a short steep crack, watch out for the detached block on corner of the shelf, then at the right side of the shelf get on an old rivet and aid the short chossy seam. Easy for \"A3\", only nailed once actually, and it'd go clean with a hand placed beak. A2, but don't fall.\n\nPitch 7: Steep C1 to beaks, to a cool hook move (the only hook i placed on the route), and finally a few bolts take you around the arete to the anchor. Awesome pitch. A2\n\nPitch 8: Really dirty seam leads into a big corner under the roof, then work left on fixed gear and out the roof. The beginning of the pitch sucks but the rest is spectacular. A1+\n\nPitch 9: Dirty and sort of chossy low angle crack and groove. Kind of miserable. C2\n\nPitch 10: Big awesome corner. If you free mid/hard 5.11 this will be super fun! C1\n\nSo above you is a big roof with two ways around it. An offwidth takes you out right to an A3 seam, and i guess this is the \"standard\" finish. I wasn't sure how to get to the start of the wide crack, it looked like some mandatory free slab climbing or something that I wasn't up for.\n\nThe alternative is a thin arching flake straight up from the anchor which gains a ledge with a tree to the left of the roof. Begin on the thin splitter to the right of the flake and then penjji over to it after about 20ft. This is an excellent pitch and it went clean up until the bolt at the top of the flake, then I had to nail a couple arrows traversing left under the roof. The final pitch is a C1 corner crack or fun and burly 5.10.","protection":"Cams from the smallest micros to 4.5\", triples in the 0.3-3\" sizes, including offsets in the smaller sizes.\n\nOffset nuts, all sizes.\n\n5 large beaks, and maybe one medium.\n\nA few LA's and a knifeblade.\n\nOne medium hook.\n\nOne regular camhook.\n\nThe #5 C4 might not be necessary on the route if you do the left finish.
