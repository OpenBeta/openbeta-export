It starts off fists and then gets wide. I think the crux is near the start, before you can get a knee in, but it's pretty steep and physical the whole way.\n\nFollow the Horse Trail past the Indian Caves until you start coming around to the east side of Washington Column. Bad Ass Momma is located on a huge boulder to the left of the trail. You can't see it from the trail and it's sort of difficult to describe where to turn off. Scramble up to the right to set up a toprope. The anchor takes 3-4\" gear. You'll want gear up to at least 4.5\" to lead it.\n\nThere's also a spectacular looking sport climb (5.hard!) on the same boulder around the corner to the right.","protection":"pro to 5\"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,5e3c95f8-ac0c-58d7-8278-934731f6453b,55f20aa7-1395-5923-b4aa-4be3541a4780,8650f6de-041e-5749-88c8-d813e904c59b","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Valley North Side","H.
