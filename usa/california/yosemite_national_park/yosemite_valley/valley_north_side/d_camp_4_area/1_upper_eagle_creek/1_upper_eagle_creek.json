The pitch ends in a small alcove on a sloping Ledge.  Bring 3 .75 sizes pieces for this pitch.  150 feet.\n\nPitch 3 (5.10b):  Pull out the small alcove on steep terrain and varied cracks.  Be mindful of loose rock.  Belay on a blocky ledge system.\n\nRap the route at the top of pitch 3.  Bring webbing and links to replace old tat as this doesn’t see many ascents.  From the top of pitch three rap 200’ down to the 4th class ledge at the top of pitch 1.  Walk off to climbers left and descend back to the base.","protection":"Offset Stopers, Doubles from .3 to #4, single black and blue alien, extra .75 and #3.  8 alpine draws and 2 regular quickdraws","location":"Essence is a pain in the ass to get to and could take you multiple hours of trudging uphill to reach.  Follow Eagle Creek to Split Pinnacle.  After passing Split Pinnacle turn west and follow the gully for about 1000’.  Right as it starts to get really steep head up and east through trees and talus towards the formation.  Eventually you will hit the toe of a buttress in the woods, walk east along the base and then straight up to the base of Essence.  Be prepared to bushwhack and bring plenty of water.  The approach is really steep.  Descend back the way you came but make sure you dirt ski as it is much fast.  The descent should take about and hour to and hour and a half."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,5e3c95f8-ac0c-58d7-8278-934731f6453b,299aebef-e61a-52d9-ab6e-8c99c9b7026b,49f9a2e7-373c-5729-a81d-4168897e2141","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Valley North Side","D.
