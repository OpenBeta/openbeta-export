It begins in a dihedral up about 40ft of decent rock.  After a few offwidth moves, step right and up a jagged hand crack to gain the good ledge.  This puts you at the base of the left-curving #5 sized beauty that is the essence of the climb.\n\nThe next 80 or so feet are glorious offwidth climbing.  Hand fist stacks and physical arm barring will help you gain ground.  Two small bulges will present some interesting \"cruxes\", but these are over quickly and it is really just a practice in persistence. There are several well-earned rests on the climb.\n\nYou pull out of the crack onto a small sloping ledge.  There is a nice horizontal crack to place mid-range cams for an anchor.  There are no bolts.  To descend we climbed another pitch, which is pretty awful to be honest.  Although the climbing was easy, the protection was questionable and the grunge was in abundance.  We were able to rap off a tree to the ground with 2 ropes.","protection":"Rack, single set from .4 to 4 inch camalots, 5-6 #5 camalots, 1 #4, 1 #4.5 (if you have it)","location":"Located left and up hill from Duncan Imperial (5.11) and The Dove (5.8) Hard to see the crack of the second pitch from the base, but just walk up hill a bit more and it will reveal itself to you.\n\nWe were able to rap off a tree to the ground with 2 70m ropes.\n\nA few bolts at the top of the 5-inch crack would make this route much more enjoyable."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,5e3c95f8-ac0c-58d7-8278-934731f6453b,45de7a20-a5b8-52ae-9362-6ea45f96081f,d7d0b543-ea1a-5904-9bd2-f218548560a2","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Valley North Side","A.
