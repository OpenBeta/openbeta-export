Some however are bent, so make sure you bring a huge variety of rivet hangers, including the cinch variety. 20 rivet hangers wouldn't be an unreasonable amount, with an emphasis on small and medium sized wire hangers, as the old aluminum rivets are pretty tight against the wall, and the larger wire hangers tend to pop off as You climb above them.","protection":"Standard Wall Rack up to a single #6. 20 rivet hangers with an emphasis on small and medium wire hangers, some of those being the cinch variety.

The last move of LIA as it links into ZM is a really fun penji off the belay into the ZM A2 arrows cornor, I stuck the swing with a heal hook to get a cam hook in. Overall the aid never felt to hard. Comparable to tribal rite.","protection":"Leave most of the iron rack just bring a hella lot of beaks and bring all the totems. We only used a couple of arrows, mostly on the ZM pitches. All hangerless button heads or machine head rivits. No sawed off angles, and just one KB low on the route. Bring the head kit as ripping a string of copper heads is possible. Some expoxi would be handy to erase some bat hooks holes that have no reason to be there. No lead bolts with hangers until ZM.","location":"Beak seem to the right of t trip.

The rock is generally solid with occasional loose sections and the climbing is a step up in difficulty from the Zodiac or Shield. Some of the fixed anchors could be replaced, as most of them consist of one good bolt in addition to one or two less-than-inspiring bolts/rivets.\n\nThe route starts out with five pitches of mostly fast and moderate free climbing that wanders up to a steep headwall. The first two pitches have some interesting free/aid traversing for those who don't plan to free climb the poorly protected 5.10-5.11 sections. The headwall is steep and sustained, never too difficult but often thought-provoking. The most difficult climbing is in thin cracks that take many beaks and sections of fixed junk (rusty broken RURPs/questionable heads). Near the top, you get to climb the amazing \"C1 Beauty\" which is one of the most striking splitters on El Cap.\n\nAs of September 2019, the route was pretty clean. Beware of some junk ropes hanging near pitch 5, they are not fixed to anything and I was alarmed to discover this after thoughtlessly yarding on them for some short sections. Eagle's Way is a solid option if you're looking to avoid crowds and check out a cool part of the wall that doesn't get climbed too often.","protection":"Cams: 3 x 0.1- 1, 2 x 2- 3, 1 x 4- 5, the C1 Beauty pitch eats up small cams (0.2 and smaller) and some offsets are useful\n\nNuts: Single set, with a selection of smaller offsets\n\nBeaks: ~10 large beaks, several each medium/small\n\nHooks: 2 x grappling, skyhook, talon\n\n~10 Rivet hangers, several cinch-style for dowels","location":"Eagle's Way starts a few hundred feet to the right of Zodiac."},"__v":0},{"_id":"8aEwlJ0rU+qybkuCsmMBdw==","name":"The Dawn Wall","yds":"5.14c","grades":{"yds":"5.14c","french":"8c+"},"fa":"Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, January 2015","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.63438,37.72954]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"109951912","mp_crag_id":"113804935","climb_id":"8aEwlJ0rU+qybkuCsmMBdw==","areaRef":"3p8HyeB7XYq/HttfICHNMQ=="},"content":{"description":"You've all seen the movie. You all know the story. The Yosemite legend and the pebble wrestling apprentice working for years on the blankest big wall in the world. Tommy sends the traverses, Kevin keeps falling. Plenty of drama for cinema to milk. They send it. Voila, hardest big wall in the world. Obviously I haven't climbed this route, but I did some research on pitch-by-pitch stuff so we can all enjoy, dream, and imagine.\n\nThere isn't much pitch-by-pitch beta to be found on the Internet, in Tommy's book, or elsewhere. Here's what I could piece together.\n\nP1 (5.12b) - It doesn't start easy. Begins on Mescalito for the first five pitches. Climb a blank, low-angle slab to a shallow crack.\n\nP2 (5.13a) - Continue on Mescalito up slabs that trend slowly steeper.\n\nP3 (5.13c) - Intermittent cracks/features on Mescalito.\n\nP4 (5.12b) - And so on.\n\nP5 (5.12d) - And so on.\n\nP6 (5.13c) - And.... so on.\n\nP7 (5.14a) - Leave Mescalito and begin following Adrift, a once-repeated aid route, at Anchorage Ledge. Follows an offset seam for a hundred feet. Protected by beaks only.\n\nP8 (5.13d) - Climb up and move right to join Mescalito again.\n\nP9 (5.13c) - Climb up and move right to join Mescalito again.\n\nP10 (5.14a) - Continue following Mescalito up the intermittent crack/dihedral system.\n\nP11 (5.13c) - Prepare for the Molar Traverse.\n\nP12 (5.14b) - The Molar Traverse.\n\nP13 (5.13b) - Preparing for the big-deal traverses. Climb off the flake up and left to the belay at the lighter-colored band.\n\nP14 (5.14d) - Traverse number one. Tiny pinches along the yellow band.\n\nP15 (5.14d) - Continuing to traverse along tiny edges and crimps until you're done! Oh wait....\n\nP16 (5.14c) - Either the Loop Pitch (.14c) or the Dyno (.14d). Loop Pitch downclimbs, traverses, and loops around the blank 8-foot section that is otherwise done in a eight-foot double dyno to a two-hand edge.\n\nP17 (5.14a) - Up through some upward-facing flakes.\n\nP18 (5.13c) - Continues through an intermittent crack system.\n\nP19 (5.13c) - Ascend crossing New Dawn and traversing right.\n\nP20 (5.13c) - Climb up the 'features' to the left of the large dihedral in which New Dawn climbs.\n\nP21 (5.13c) - Keep on climbing up.\n\nP22 (5.12c) - To Wino Tower!\n\nP23 (5.9) - Easy pitch above Wino Tower.\n\nP24 (5.11) - Long blank but moderate pitches heading up and right.\n\nP25 (5.11) - Continue as above.\n\nP26 (5.11d) - Up and around a flake, then traverse slightly right.\n\nP27 (5.11c) - Climb up then a longer traverse to join Mescalito once again.\n\nP28 (5.12c) - Joining Mescalito, and climbing higher in its crack system.\n\nP29 (5.12b) - Long pitch up to the Ship’s Bow.\n\nP30 (5.13a) - Begin a long traverse right, breaking away from Mescalito.\n\nP31 (5.12a) - Continue traversing.\n\nP32 (5.12b) - The final pitch, on the Tempest. You’re done!\n\nThe Dawn Wall, 5.14d, Grade VI, FA Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, January 2015. It’s had one repeat by Adam Ondra in eight days, November 2016.
