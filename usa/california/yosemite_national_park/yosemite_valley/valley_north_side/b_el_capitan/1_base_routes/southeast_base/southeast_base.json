It climbs beautiful squeaky clean orange and grey El Cap granite to the top of a feature called negative pinnacle.\n\nAlthough the angle is less than vertical, it climbs much more like a face climb than a slab climb, using edges, sidepulls, mantles, and even a few pockets.\n\nThe first crux is a dynamic hand-foot match between bolts one and two, with the true crux on hard sidepull moves between bolts two and three just above. Above that, interesting climbing across an improbably blank face and a few 5.12 sections keeps you agonizingly focused for 120ft.","protection":"11 Bolts. As Tron was hand drilled on lead, there are a few places with exciting space between bolts on easy terrain.

It climbs up and left to chains for the last rappel if bailing from the Stove Legs on the Nose.\n\nA second rope is required to rappel.\n\nThe start can be top-roped from the Party Mix anchors."},"__v":0},{"_id":"3+v9ECgQWsGQ/ekQ6+pw1A==","name":"Simulkrime","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"John Middendorf, Tucker Tech, 1985","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.63636,37.72855]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"107161821","mp_crag_id":"116970919","climb_id":"3+v9ECgQWsGQ/ekQ6+pw1A==","areaRef":"3gyc+xzrX2+BP6wICE9MxA=="},"content":{"description":"Looong single-pitch route which requires a 70m rope (just enough).
