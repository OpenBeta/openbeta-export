Moderate and easy climbing, good rock, replaced bolts (thank you!) and some good ledges up higher make it a good route for those who want to go faster or take their time.\n\nSqueeze Play starts on Lost World, a climb established by Anderson, Folsom, and Warburton in 1975. Lurking Fear, the more popular, crowded, and easier climb is located immediately to the left of Squeeze Play. It was established the year after Lost World, 1976.\n\nThe climb starts on lower angle high quality rock. Nice free and aid crack systems take you to a broad slab and rivets left towards a point at the base of two huge dihedral/crack systems. The crack straight up from this belay is Lost World, the rivet ladder leading to the left dihedral is Squeeze Play. Once in the dihedral, the climbing is really fun and nicely shaded in the afternoon. At about 700 feet above the deck the climbing gets progressively harder and cruxes out at pitch 8, beaks and some heads. Climbing pitches 9-11 is surprisingly straightforward and takes you to a sweet ledge right underneath the West Buttress route traverse. The West Buttress Route is one of El Capitan's oldest routes - put up by Kor and Roper in '63.  This traverse goes quickly and safely. Enjoy the location. The rest gets traveled often by Lurking Fear climbers.\n\nThis a good route to climb in a push because if too wiped it is possible to sleep on p11, or the nice ledge three pitches higher, or even Thanksgiving Ledge.

The climb might be the longest route on El Cap at 35 pitches. There are many great ledges on this route, so consider leaving the portaledge at home.\n\nA common strategy is to either pre-haul to Heart Ledges, or rap once you get there and haul the next day. Four fixed lines bring you back to the ground. I wouldn't recommend hauling the free blast because it traverses a lot, is low angle, and will have the biggest crowds of the route.\n\nThis climb breaks up nicely into several days worth of climbing. The first logical block is the Free Blast, which consists of the first 10 pitches of the route. Most of this can be free climbed for a 5.10 trad leader, and can be done fairly quickly. The climbing is low angle in comparison with the rest of the route, with a thrutch up the half dollar chimney on pitch 8. The free blast will leave you on top of Mammoth Terraces (where the Shield and Muir Wall diverge). From here, rap off the left side about 200 feet to Heart Ledges.\n\nFrom Heart, some non-obvious climbing leads up to Lung Ledge. Scramble up this ledge system until near its left end and set a belay. The next pitch is the hollow flake, with a pretty big pendulum required to gain the start of the flake. The lower part of this pitch can take a #6 camalot, but it can't be left because it gets too wide before you are above your pendulum point. The upper part of the hollow flake is extremely run out. This pitch ends up on the spacious hollow flake ledge (not a bad place for 2 people to sleep).\n\nFrom here, the route becomes a lot more plum, with a ton of traversing up to this point. A difficult chimney pitch right off of hollow flake ledge leads to two straight forward pitches. Above that is the other well known pitch of the route, the Ear. This pitch climbs into an overhanging bombay chimney. As you climb higher, it keeps getting narrower, until you have to chimney outwards and possibly remove your helmet. This pitch has good gear.\n\nAnother pitch leads up to the Alcove, a great bivy ledge. From the back of the Alcove, a chimney leads to the coolest bivy spot ever, El Cap Spire. This spire is flat and airy, is big enough for a tent, and is detached on all sides. It is a big step across to gain the next crack system. Sleep here and enjoy it because the ledges are quite a bit worse above.\n\nA few more pitches of aid continue up, with a squeeze through a 5.9 chimney. This brings you to the base of the Sewer. This pitch almost always seeps water, and requires placing aliens in goo covered cracks. The end of this pitch is a hanging belay, so link it another short pitch length to the sloping but roomy \"Block\". This is an ok bivy, but you have to be creative.\n\nThe climb tends diagonally up and left from here to a small ledge. the Sous Le Toit. A nice place to belay, but not a place to sleep. One long linked pitch gains the base of the roof below the headwall, where the climb gets exciting. Tackle the roof on mostly fixed gear, and continue up to a hanging belay. This jug is as airy as it gets. The headwall is split by a beautiful finger crack, which ends at Long Ledge.\n\nLong Ledge is the home stretch, and it is a very narrow ledge in a cool position. From the right side of the ledge, climb up for a few more pitches to the top.\n\nFree grade: 5.13b","protection":"This route amazingly has very little fixed gear. There aren't even fixed anchors in many spots. 2 sets of nuts, including small HB offsets.

Towering nearly 3000' this route offers 31 pitches of superb climbing right up the middle of the wall.  Often referred to as the \"best rock climb in the world\" it is obvious why this route is one of the most sought after big walls in the valley and the world.  Most of the pitches on this route are outstanding but with classics such as the \"Stovelegs\", \"King Swing\" and \"Great Roof\" you'll wish it would never end.

First if you and or your partner(s) can lead 5.10 solidly this will greatly speed up the amount of time it takes to climb this route as a large percentage of the climb is 5.10 or easier.  Second study the topo carefully because there are numerous opportunities to either link or use alternate belays in order to skip pitches (a team of three can also skip hauling certain pitches with some good planning).  Unavoidable factors are the number of parties on the route and the weather, both of which can make the route not so classic.

From El Capitan Meadow cross the road and find one of the obvious approach trails which should lead to a clearing.  From the clearing you should be able to find a well worn path leading north and slightly west towards the wall.  Once at the base of the wall you'll be standing directly under \"The Nose\".  Hike up and left around the foot of the wall until it is possible to traverse back right and you should end up on a nice dirt ledge and the start of the first pitch.

Positioned on the on the impressive nose of rock between Lurking Fear and Dihedral Wall, the route has a great view of the huge concave Southwest wall of the Capitan. The climbing is harder than Lurking Fear, better than Lost World, and about the same difficulty as the current state of Zodiac, New Dawn, Shield, etc.\n\nThe route starts on Aquarian Wall, a line originally unlocked by Kim Schmitz and Jim Bridwell in 1971. Both had teamed up to complete the Triple Direct together in '69. Aquarian was Bridwell's first independent route on El Cap. They had attempted the line before but bad weather forced a desperate bivy and dangerous retreat. The team linked thin piton cracks with a few bolt ladders up to the right side of Timbuktu Tower. This is the start to Never Never Land.\n\nTimbuktu Tower is where the Never Never Land variant deviates from Aquarian Wall. This huge flat ledge is the only obvious ledge on the West Buttress. Crack a soda, watch the sunset, and bivy on this really nice patio. The next 3 pitches off of this ledge are tricky, expect them to take a little longer. Chapman and Hawkins did some creative hooking and pendulums to access a shallow vertical corner. This corner crack system climbs really fun A2 and lots of A1/C1 placements - usually some big beaks and offset cams get you through anything tricky. Link the 2 pitches up to Long Ledge and the 2 after to the Pinnacle of Hammerdom.\n\nThe Pinnacle of Hammerdom has a great anchor for a hanging bivy. From here, a pretty continuous ramp and crack takes climbers to Thanksgiving Ledge. Enjoy your time here, the exposure is great the aspect, perfect.

I couldn't believe I was going back up. Extended climbs are at least as punishing mentally. Can't relax. Seven days of trusting my life to flimsy gadgets and fragile ropes. Got to stay alert. No mistakes - Ran out of food and water and had to spring to the summit, climbing most of the final night by headlamp and moonlight.\"\n\nPorter - “That summer Walter Rosenthal and I got interested in doing an alternative route to the Nose. Maybe Bev and I were having trouble then, I don't remember. But we were looking at a long angled climb on El Cap, that I was going to call El Cappidosia.

Named Flight of the Albatross to commemorate Will Oxx’s base jump off the summit after the FA.\n\nFOTA is a bit off the beaten path despite being just to the left of the ultra-classic Shield route making it a perfect route for a team that has done a decent number of El Cap routes and is looking for a little bit more adventure and a few hard pitches but still within the relative comfort of the trade route nearby. The route has two “hard pitches” the Whipper Will A3+ pitch and the Walk the Plank A4 pitch. Whipper Will is going test all the aid tricks up your sleeve while the Walk the Plank pitch will test your skills with small beaks as you imagine yourself ripping all those beak tips and riding the canoe to the ground.","protection":"Your favorite El cap aid rack to 4” with an emphasize on small beaks, some folks may appreciate a 5” piece for the shield finish but it is not necessary.","location":"FOTA originally began from Heart ledges but most climbers today climb the route from Mammoth Terraces after climbing the Freeblast.
