Ax Nelson then used prussics to ascend the fixed rope. This ascent was highly criticized by the climbing community and called “ One of the greatest rope stunts ever pulled off in history” by Steve Roper. Later that year, an undisputed ascent of the Lost Arrow Chimney was completed by John Salathe and Ax Nelson which was the longest, and hardest free climb done at that time. The Lost Arrow Tip was ascended using aid following a crack system (the route used to climb it today) the next year (1947) by John Salathe who was a blacksmith by trade and had fashioned specialty pitons made of chromoly steel for the hard granite of Yosemite. These pitons (designed by John Salathe) would go on to be known as Lost Arrows and are still in use today.\n\nP1: .10d pin scars and fingers right off the notch (easy for the rating, some fixed gear, short crux) to easier climbing to more fixed gear and a stance below an awkward slightly bulging, grainy, and flaring .10a fist/OW for a few moves to a belay on a huge ledge.\n\nP2: Move left off the ledge using a couple of small pieces to a large flat edge than can be hooked or bust a psuedo-free 5.8ish move to get the next placement. A few placements interspersed with bolts/rivets (both with and without hangers..take some small wires or rivet hangers) leads to a full-on bolt ladder than ends as the angle kicks back about 15' below the top. Step out of the aiders and fight the rope drag on the dead easy slab that will feel harder with the drag.\n\nOr, free it at 5.12b, stopping to belay halfway up this pitch after it stops traversing left to cut down the rope drag.\n\nTerrific position and novelty make this a must do. The climbing itself is largely forgettable.","protection":"Standard Free Rack w/ one 4\" piece for the OW section.  Otherwise small - medium cams will do you fine.

Time to climb the route depends of your endurance and skills. It shorter than Steck -Salathe but harder and take about the same time. You can link this route with Lost Arrow spire and end up with glorious Tyrollean traverse, but in this case you need to spend one more day to fix ropes from the Rim to the notch, or ask your friends to do that.\n\nMy friends Chad Suchoski and Zander Brennen did this route few years ago and wrote nice reports on ST:\n\nsupertopo.com/climbing/thre…\n\nsupertopo.com/tr/Lost-Arrow…\n\n.\n\nI recently climb this route with Zander and think that this remarkable route should be added to MP.\n\nWe did route in the end of September with temperature mid 80F and it was in the shade almost all day. Still two liters of water each of us had was not enough.\n\nWe used second rope for haling small bag with foot, water and excessive gear.\n\nReid topo has not many details, but the general line of the chimney unmistakably bring you to the notch.\n\nP1. Start route in the right crack than after 70 ft cross to left crack and ascend 70 more feet to belay ledge. 140ft, 5.8\n\nP2. straight forward 140 ft, 5.9. . We linked p1&2 with 70ft of semulclimbing\n\nP3. Main feature of the pitch big wide roof 5.9 [left side in]. This roof can be bypassed on left at 5.9 thin cracks and face moves. 80 ft. Belay on Horsman ledge or link with next pitch\n\nP4. Safety Valve - first long ow stretch, but not the crux of the route. 120' 5.9\n\nP5. Wide chimney pitch with cracks in left and right side of the chimney. You can use booth #6 on this pitch. 100 ft, 5.9\n\nP6. Was mental crux for me because I read Chad's TR and his description of this pitch:\n\n\"next pitch which was a fun finger tieback on the side of the chimney with a little stem across and onto the face where you're supposed to pass a couple bolts and back into the chimney. There were no bolts, but there was a piton. After making the most awkward move in climbing history to gain access back into the chimney, (picture your right foot in a small corner, your right hand on a knob and leaning over a chimney trying to reach the other side of the wall more than 4ft away. Then just letting go of the knob and falling into the wall bridging the large gap with your body. Now turn and lunge for that suspect chockstone [which rolls a bit] and pulling yourself back into the main part of the chimney\"\n\nI really did not want to do this weird jumping on face and especially back. But there is a way- you just go straight(completely ( ignoring Reid's topo bypass) in the crack and climb flare/ow at 5.10 with good pro #6 . 100ft\n\nP7. Chimney, wide chimney all the way. Rotten to the top of the pitch and in term of pro- the worst pitch 120 ft, 5.8\n\nP8. Climb increasingly hard chimney to new bolt. Crux - long reach for handhold just after you clip the bolt. 100 ft, 10a\n\nChad and Zander replaced two old rusty bolts for shining one in 2009, thanks\n\nP9. Pithch Start with 5.10a flare/ow { right side in) . Than from the middle of the pitch you have two options\n\na) follow the crack system to second upper 10a flare climbing mostly outside\n\nb) enter dip into chimney and bypass upper flare inside. You and your partner need to be small for this variation\n\nP10. Have two option ( we did not find Harding hole) . See also enclosed Zander's topo of last pitch\n\na) climb 5.9 crack in the corner ( looks like better option), b) but we climbed 5.9 thin hands ( felt harder than 5.9)\n\nNow you on the notch - find first set of bolts on your right in the base of the Spire and go home. Or continue up...","protection":"Double from green Aliens to #2 Camalot. One #3.\n\nBig Gear: We used 2x#6. It probably be about same if take one#5 and one#6.
