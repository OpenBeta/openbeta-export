We took the right variation which I believe is named \"Brown Eyed Girl\" (5.9), and follows enjoyable hand jams and easy offwidthing up double cracks and a groove. The left variation begins with some difficult and poorly protected stemming moves getting out of the alcove and then ascends a chimney. This is supposedly 5.9 as well. Both these variations converge at a bolted anchor at the top of the pitch.\n\nThe second pitch starts with a thinning splitter. Once it pinches down, step left to a fist crack and follow it past an old bolted anchor to arrive at an alcove. Out of the alcove is the crux offwidth. I squeezed a #6 Camalot in near the start and then walked my #5 with me, but having two #5's would have been much more useful. At the top of the offwidth scramble up and right to a bolted anchor.\n\nRappel the route to descend. One 70m works fine, a 60m might be stretching it so be careful.

The route starts just below a big rotting fallen tree trunk. You have a choice of two cracks to start: a squeeze chimney on the left, or a slot with thinner cracks on the right. Climb through a big oak tree and then up more dirty cracks. Near then end, make a traverse (5.8) up and right to a bolted anchor just above a pine.\n\nWould be worth a star if it were clean.","protection":"Pro to 2.5\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"LA1wSFjRXxSGd5j38r0TLw==","name":"[Redacted]","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"Tucker Tech (1989)","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.62316,37.72965]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"110301708","mp_crag_id":"106612472","climb_id":"LA1wSFjRXxSGd5j38r0TLw==","areaRef":"oTA0z4QvV4CmGMWcjf/3ZA=="},"content":{"description":"Sport climb to the right of Orange Juice Avenue.
