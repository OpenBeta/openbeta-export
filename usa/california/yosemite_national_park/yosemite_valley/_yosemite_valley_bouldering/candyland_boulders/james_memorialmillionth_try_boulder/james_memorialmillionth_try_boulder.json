The long, curving arete on the right side will be the most striking feature. This arete is the James Memorial Problem.\n\nSit start with a high grip and then pinch and slap your way up the arete, using a crimp on the face to the right at one point. The landing is good for the first half and then becomes a slanted hillside for the topout. Luckily the climbing also becomes easier in the upper portion.","protection":"Pads","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,662fc058-2269-5b7a-b715-71dcd4f34c93,586e597d-0a99-589e-8dab-dc897d828997,b162da08-f6c5-5d10-9ed0-48683c837db6","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","* Yosemite Valley Bouldering","Candyland Boulders","James Memorial/Millionth Try Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.61276,37.72023]},"bbox":[-119.61332846508353,37.71978033981814,-119.61219153491649,37.720679660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110821591","area_id":"sWLaCPbFXRCe0EhoPIN9tg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:50.578Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:27.769Z"}
