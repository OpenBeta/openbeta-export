It could use some more traffic to clean up. When I did it, I had to brush off the holds as I went.\n\nStart standing on a small boulder near the center of the face. Mantle onto a little shelf and then traverse left on thin edges to a hole. The first move of the traverse is scary because the rock is below you, but after that you get out over a clear landing. From the hole climb straight up to an easy topout.\n\nI think the easiest way down is to downclimb the northwest arete, then at the ledge, traverse left a short ways and then continue downclimbing. It's also possible to downclimb a very high corner on the south side of the boulder, or butt-scoot across a fallen tree branch which is resting on the north side of the boulder.","protection":"Pads","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"vKeKXf0lWBG3f0lrwFnvDA==","name":"Double Decker","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.58369,37.75047]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"108101159","mp_crag_id":"112517185","climb_id":"vKeKXf0lWBG3f0lrwFnvDA==","areaRef":"2Uj0f3Y/W+WfZa40Ce2rXg=="},"content":{"description":"An excellent highball on the Medicine Man boulder. This is probably the best problem at Indian Creek in the easy-moderate range.\n\nThe original starting hold\n\nbroke off\n\na few years ago. You can still begin standing with a sidepull edge at around V3, or begin lower on the original hold which is a bit harder. The easiest and least contrived way to being is by just doing a short hop to the juggy rail. How you start is really inconsequential as the problems character lies in the upper section.\n\nClimb up the corner on good jugs and edges for feet. Several feet up the good holds run out and you must reach up and left to an edge. Get your feet up over the steep section and then feel around over the top to find the some good holds and mantel over. The upper crux is probably only 5.10c (V0+), but comes a ways off the deck. Having stacked pads is nice.\n\nI think the easiest way down is to downclimb the arete to the right. At the ledge, traverse left a short ways and then continue downclimbing. It's also possible to downclimb a very high corner on the south side of the boulder, or butt-scoot across a fallen tree branch which is resting on the north side of the boulder.","protection":"Pads","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,662fc058-2269-5b7a-b715-71dcd4f34c93,9ee71ad5-8969-5063-8116-fbf4d3a93d91,d948f47f-763f-5be5-9f65-ae3409edab5e","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","* Yosemite Valley Bouldering","Indian Creek Boulders","Medicine Man, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"V2"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.58369,37.75047]},"bbox":[-119.5842586973154,37.75002033981814,-119.5831213026846,37.750919660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112517185","area_id":"2Uj0f3Y/W+WfZa40Ce2rXg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:47.923Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:24.467Z"}
