It is located on the large block right next to the parking lot, and is on the arete which faces away from the Ahwahnee. The horse trail passes right beneath it.\n\nStart with fun dynamic moves slapping up the arete and opposing rail. Ten feet up you will reach the \"mouth\", and the mantel into it is assisted by a good face hold above. Above the mouth it climbs more like a free solo than a boulder problem. Step right to a good dish on the slab and then climb straight up on small but \"crimpable\" edges. These moves are about 5.8 R/X. Don't attempt to topout if it has rained recently and it looks like the moss is wet.\n\nDownclimb the opposite side of the boulder to get off.","protection":"Pads","location":"North side of the Ahwahnee Boulder itself, right next to the lodge parking lot, in the east section of the Ahwahnee Boulders area."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,662fc058-2269-5b7a-b715-71dcd4f34c93,bc20ad49-b245-5589-b482-5053346f0537,4ce2f649-039d-5ca1-9fd2-edd58d8e13ea","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","* Yosemite Valley Bouldering","Ahwahnee Boulders","Ahwahnee Boulder, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V-easy"},{"count":1,"label":"V9"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.57384,37.74732]},"bbox":[-119.57440867310834,37.746870339818145,-119.57327132689169,37.74776966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111833706","area_id":"TOL2SQOdXKGf0u3VjY4T6g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.57440867310834,37.746870339818145],[-119.57327132689169,37.746870339818145],[-119.57327132689169,37.74776966018186],[-119.57440867310834,37.74776966018186],[-119.57440867310834,37.746870339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:52.039Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:04.222Z"}
