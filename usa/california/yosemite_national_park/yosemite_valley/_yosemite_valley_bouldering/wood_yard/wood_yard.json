This is about half a mile down past the El Cap meadow. Steal Your Face is the first problem you'll see on the left. It faces the old logging road.\n\nMantel into a scoop and get stemmed as high as you can on the right-trending ramp, then lunge up and right to a pinch/sidepull at the lip. The topout requires some groveling. Might be a good idea to clean off the top beforehand and scope out where the holds are up there.\n\nClassic problem with varied moves and perfect landing. One of my favorite V4's in the Valley.\n\nThe unnamed \"V3\" just to the right is several grades harder than that.

This is about half a mile down past the El Cap meadow. Just a couple hundred feet up the old logging road there's a boulder on the left. Steal Your Face is the scoop facing the trail. For \"The End\", walk around the boulder to the right to a vertical face immediately left of a huge dead tree.\n\nStart sitting on a good rail. Make some moves past a really thin crimp to reach another good rail. Then reach out right to a hold on the arete and then up to the top.\n\nThe sit start will feel scrunched if you're tall and the crimp move is sort of painful, but the upper portion of the problem is classic climbing. The rock is really blank except for a handful of edges which are just where you need them for the problem to go. Perfect landing... unless a tourist pooped under it.\n\nThe V2 arete climb to the left is pretty fun too.","protection":"Pads","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,662fc058-2269-5b7a-b715-71dcd4f34c93,6d9e04f1-3c1e-5f33-a4c0-522cc2f9ab30","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","* Yosemite Valley Bouldering","Wood Yard"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"},{"count":2,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.63965,37.72531]},"bbox":[-119.6402185040717,37.724860339818136,-119.63908149592832,37.725759660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111788806","area_id":"bZ4E8TweXzOkwFIswvmrMA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.6402185040717,37.724860339818136],[-119.63908149592832,37.724860339818136],[-119.63908149592832,37.725759660181865],[-119.6402185040717,37.725759660181865],[-119.6402185040717,37.724860339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:47.051Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:58.247Z"}
