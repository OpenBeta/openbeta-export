Approximately 20' tall with a short approach, flat landing, and easy walk off, this slightly leaning splitter finger crack is great for honing your thin fingercrack technique.

It's near a large rectangular-prism boulder about 8 feet high. From here, head up the hill and slightly right in order to find the hiking trail.
