The crux is probably the squeeze exit. Big folks will have problems here. Start 11' back under the roof at a blocky pod, get the feet over your head and move to a big, sharp, positive flake  type feature at the edge of the crack. Work out to the lip and squeeze through. The landing has been leveled and the one drawback is how close to the ground the crack is.","protection":"Pad/spotter.","location":"This is a little hard to find. The easiest way is probably to approach from the Finger Crack which lies just uphill from this. Standing on the \"patio\" by Finger Crack you will be looking at the top of the boulder that holds the problem just downhill about 25' away. The problem is facing away from you if approaching from above."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,662fc058-2269-5b7a-b715-71dcd4f34c93,32ef24ee-74db-50d9-a60d-dde177c95a54,25676b33-fa0c-5934-8b90-92c9d15cb035","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","* Yosemite Valley Bouldering","Camp 4 Boulders","Manual Labor Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.604,37.74285]},"bbox":[-119.60456863876381,37.742400339818126,-119.60343136123615,37.74329966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112024450","area_id":"JWdrM/oMWTSLkJLJ0VywNQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.60456863876381,37.742400339818126],[-119.60343136123615,37.742400339818126],[-119.60343136123615,37.74329966018185],[-119.60456863876381,37.74329966018185],[-119.60456863876381,37.742400339818126]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:50.595Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:37.542Z"}
