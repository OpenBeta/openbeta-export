Clip one of the first two bolts on the ladder for security and use chimney technique to ascend directly below the chockblock.  Place a bomber small to medium cam with a long runner and pull the strenuous old school 5.8 moves to gain the slopped and sandy top of the chockblock.  Set up a belay in the tree/bushes further above the chockblock.\n\nPitch 2)  Bump the belay up to an alcove at the highest point of the slopped and sandy ledge.\n\nClimb a hollow stack of blocks (5.5) until a bush with years of broken sticks and sediment blocks your progress.  Find a passage through the bush and debris.  Set up a belay on top of the debris at the base of a dark and intimidating chimney.\n\nPitch 3)  Easily begin up the chimney setting questionable pro until a good rest is reached below an impasse.  Slowly stem toward the outside of the chimney to eventually regain upward progress (5.7).  Climb up the narrowing and increasingly rotten chimney.  Stay on route here and do not escape toward Tithe.\n\nWhen you reach the top of the climb, find a large pine tree with slings and biners for the start of the rappels.  Make one double rope rappel to the sandy/sloped top of pitch one.  Find a ledge that traverses over the top of pitch one, looking for a rappel anchor that consists of a rusty quarter inch bolt and an old stopper.  Make a single rope rappel from the bolt/stopper anchor back to the start of the climb.","protection":"Standard rack to 4.5\"\n\nExtra slings\n\nTwo ropes","location":"Follow the directions to Drive By Shooting.
