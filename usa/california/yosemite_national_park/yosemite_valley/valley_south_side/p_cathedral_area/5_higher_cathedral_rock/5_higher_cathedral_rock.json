It follows the huge left-facing corner just uphill from Braille Book. If Braille Book looks like a cluster, just keep walking. The Sequel starts off a big ledge that is accessed from above. Some bushwhacking is required on the final approach, so stash whatever you're not bringing on the climb out in the talus, before the going gets tough (or you'll end up doing the bushwhack thrice). Faster parties would do well to link this climb with another of the shorter routes on HCR, or a route on HCS.\n\nThe rock at this end of Higher Cathedral is exceptionally featured with diorite knobs. Unlike most chimney climbs in the Valley, you're not using pure oppositional force on glassy rock the whole way up. It's more like the chimney climbing in Red Rocks, where half the time you're just face climbing up one of the walls of the chimney. It's a pretty unique climb on very solid rock that's surprisingly clean given the lack of traffic. The climb receives morning shade, then a bit of sun in the late morning/high noon before the whole wall goes into the shade in the afternoon.\n\nYou can start by just climbing fun knobs on the wall outside the chimney. After 40ft or something, the features get smaller and you'll want to enter the chimney. Stem and chimney your way up for a full ropelength. There's a bit of 5.7-5.8 stuff towards the end of the pitch. Belay at a stance in the far back of the chimney. There are a few nuts behind a chockstone and you should back this up with a biggish cam (3-4\") in the crack.\n\nThe second pitch climbs a steep and flared squeeze chimney (5.7). There's occasionally a good placement for nuts or small cams in the various cracks you'll find on one of the walls of the chimney. But if you want to really sew-it-up you'll need some 6\" (or bigger) gear. At the top of the chimney climb out the right side to a ledge. You can set a belay here or continue up a fist crack off right and then up the face on big knobs. Belay at a large ledge.\n\nThe final pitch is shared with Braille Book and most other climbs in the vicinity. There are a variety of ways to go. My favorite is to scramble up and left, passing a triangle overhang on its left side, and then ascend straight up the remarkable headwall on bucket-sized knobs and flakes. Some of the most fun 5.4 jug-hauling you'll ever do.\n\nTo descend, follow cairns and a climbers trail south-west through brush, and then contour to the left, descending open slabs. This leads to a short 3rd/4th class gully (just two downclimbing \"boulder problems\") after which you will be back at the top of the Spires Gully.","protection":"Pro to 4\", 6\"+ optional.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"FgvqaiegV3uLYml720yq3A==","name":"Renaissance Wall","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Bob Gaines and Alan Bartlett (June 2000)","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.63469,37.71439]},"left_right_index":10,"mp_id":"112964634","mp_crag_id":"105833493","climb_id":"FgvqaiegV3uLYml720yq3A==","areaRef":"sQm7BszMXXm8pB/m0JOecQ=="},"content":{"description":"This is a worthwhile aid route up the middle of the east side of HCR. No one ever climbs in that huge expanse of wall between the NEB and Book of Job, so it's a cool place to explore. The route's a little dirty, but not too bad. The rock is mostly solid. The climbing is sustained and challenging, but never that hard or dangerous. None of the pitches are super classic, but none of them are heinous either. Almost all the anchors are bolted and the bolts and rivets are still in decent shape. Go give it a try if you're looking to do some aid in the Cathedrals.\n\nThe topo in the Sloan/Putnam Bigwalls book is detailed and accurate, you don't really need any more beta than that. But here's a brief pitch breakdown.\n\nPitch 1: Short easy slab. Maybe one or two moves of unprotected 5.6 to gain a ramp. Bolted anchor at the top of the slab. You can link this with the next pitch with a 60m.\n\nPitch 2: Right facing corner. Thin roof is the crux. Maybe 25ft of beaks and KB's. One of the more sustained sections of nailing on the route.\n\nPitch 3: Continue up the corner then follow bolts, rivets, and features up to another anchor. There's a reachy natural hook move between a couple bolts that requires getting up high in your aiders on an overhang.\n\nPitch 4: Climb a flake up and left then mixed aid and free to get up on a pinnacle with a detached top. This is an extremely short pitch and can be linked with either pitch 3 or 5.\n\nPitch 5: Watch out for the detached block just above the belay. Climb up and left to a 3 bolt anchor next to a left facing flake. This is a pretty good portaledge bivy because the bolts are spaced apart and the wall is flat.\n\nPitch 6: Climb past 4 rivets, then move left to a flake. Continue up to another anchor at a stance.\n\nPitch 7: Mix of free and aid to get under the roof, then either nail left or tension traverse and free climb up. Super short pitch, link it with either the previous or the following (watch rope drag if linking with p8).\n\nPitch 8: Go up the corner and through the roof. Some free climbing here and there will make this go quicker.\n\nPitch 9: Thin corner leads up to a roof with a tree above it. Getting past the tree is a real bummer. Anchor has one bolt and takes some gear in the 1-2\" range.\n\nPitch 10: Transfer into the crack to the right of the corner and move over onto some low angle terrain. A thin crack leads to a couple hook moves, then step left to a thin crack which leads to the anchor. This is the second place I bivied and it worked out well.\n\nPitch 11: Low angle thin crack leads past one bolt and a bathole to reach big stacked blocks. Free climb the rest of the way @5.7 and belay at an oak tree.\n\nPitch 12: Free climb up and left and do a few moves of traversing aid to get under the massive corner. Mantle onto a slab and climb (mostly free) up the corner to the top. You could also climb that nice looking flake just right of the corner and penji over when it ends. Scramble around to find a suitable place to build an anchor and haul, then shuttle loads to the top.\n\nThe descent is the usual walk-off back into the Spires Gully.","protection":"At least a triple set of cams to 1.5\" including offsets.

One month later, the park closed due to COVID, shortly thereafter the Summer heat set in and once Fall arrived, the wildfires started. Considering the obstacles, we certainly didn't expect that the route would be completed in 2020, but we kept at it. Fortunately, we were able to squeak-out a team-free ascent and now Higher Cathedral has new free climb which provides an alternate, high quality path to access the Crucifix ledge (similar to Mary's Tears). From that ledge, parties can then continue up NEB or Crucifix. A linkup with Crucifix would be proud.\n\nThis route is about 1/3 independent and about 2/3 pre-existing aid pitches, which now go free (parts of Learning to Crawl, Generation Gap and Wild Apes). All rivets and old bolts on existing aid route pitches (which are used for this free climb) were upgraded to modern 3/8\" stainless, including anchors. Two bolts were added to Generation Gap, with the FA permission, in a rock scar (which appeared after the FA of that route).\n\nThis wall gets morning sun. In the early Summer it goes into the shade at about 2pm, in the Winter it gets very little sun. In the early Spring and late Fall, it goes into the shade around 1pm.\n\nPitch 1 (40m, 5.10- or 5.11- or 5.11R):\n\nScramble up 3rd and 4th class ledges at the base of Learning to Crawl and either trend left for an aesthetic 5.11R stemming corner or head right, up easier terrain (5.9). Eventually the two paths meet up at pitons, face climb past the pitons and either (a) keep going up the corner on dirty rock and step left at the anchor (5.10-), or (b) step-out left onto the face before the dirty rock to a finger crack and a crux (11-) just before the anchor (better option).\n\nPitch 2 \"Path of the Penitent\" (30m, 5.11+):\n\nContinue up the face via a finger crack and beautifully sculpted crimps. Eventually the crack will disappear and bolts will appear. Clip the bolts as you pass a technical crux and more amazing face climbing on gym-like crimps, to a ledge and a two bolt anchor. Basically sport climbing.\n\nPitch 3 \"Leap of Faith\" (short pitch, 5.9 high traverse or 5.11+ low traverse)\n\n:\n\nFor the high traverse, bring only a few large-finger sized cams and traverse the bolt line on jugs and ledges to a short downclimb to the anchor. The follower may leave cams in the crack, which is shared with the start of the next pitch. For the low traverse (no gear needed), get low, like real low, then traverse on slopers and karate kick your way through the crux to the anchor. The start of the low traverse will be heads-up for the follower but the climbing is easy. Both options lead back to Learning to Crawl at its third pitch anchor.\n\nPitch 4 \"The Sport Pitch\" (30m, 5.12-):\n\nClimbs straight up the first half of the third pitch of Learning to Crawl and past a blown-out bashie to a bolt with a fixed draw. Double up on .5 cams below the bashie and bust a few moves to clip the draw. Fire the powerful lieback crux up a shallow crack with a good edge. Small totems, C3s and alloy offset nuts work best on this pitch. Keep it together and clip a fixed pin near the top then make a short face traverse left, clip the bolt with a long sling and traverse back out right on new ground, passing one more bolt, to the anchor on the face.\n\nPitch 5 \"Respect Your Elders\" (40m, 5.11+):\n\nFollow the bolt line up cool face features which bring you to a small ledge and a spike at a large rock scar. Get jiggy with the spike while clipping two bolts and climb the awesome corner crack of Generation Gap to an optional anchor. Either stop at the GG anchor and belay (awkward) or keep going up and right past burly roofs and ramps (11+), protected with bolts and gear. Belay at small stance from a semi-hanging bolted anchor. A long and sustained pitch.\n\nPitch 6 \"The Wild Apes Traverse\" (20m, 5.11+):\n\nThis pitch shares its first half with pitch 5 of Wild Apes, then transitions to new terrain until it rejoins Apes at the anchor. From the start, delicately work your way up and right via sporty and airy face-climbing to an old fixed nut. Keep an eye out for gear along the way, specifically a blind BD#1 crack around a bulge (to the Climber’s right). At the old fixed nut, break away from Wild Apes by traversing right via bolts, to a crimp rail at your feet. Drop down on the rail and hand traverse past a seasonally wet water streak, continue up past more bolts to an anchor at a good ledge.\n\nEither rappel here or continue up the grassy 5.9 crack (Wild Apes) to the Crucifix ledge. From the ledge, continue up NEB, Crucifix or Gemini. You may also rappel Mary's Tears from this ledge (2x 60m ropes).\n\nIf rappelling (2x 60m ropes), from top of P6, do a 35m rappel to the intermediate anchor near the top of the P5 corner pitch (in corner). From there, rappel 200’ to base of crux pitch (P4), then another 200’ to 3rd class ledges on the ground.\n\nIt may be possible to rappel the whole route with a single 80m rope and maybe even a 70m with some 4th class down climbing at the bottom.

Traverse about 15ft left below a grungy looking arch with a pin. the Crucifix starts here. Make hard lay-back moves to a long reach into thin fingers. Follow this crack to an improbable appearing open book. Stem and smear past adequate protection to a roof, traversing left and above to easy low angle climbing. Belay at the base of the curved overhanging fist crack. Two #3 Camalots and two #3.5 Camalots will see you through the fists. The crack varies in size a bunch above. Belay at the base of a wide(#5 Camalot) crack. The first ten feet are brutal. This narrows to thin hands, capped by a right traverse. Your second will whine if you don't consider his protection here. Traverse to the right edge of the ledge and belay. Single bolt at your feet plus a pod for a 3/4 camalot. The crack above takes RPS and # 2 or 3 lowe balls. There may be something fixed. Make a few difficult stems to reach the finger crack. Follow this to an overhanging thin crack. Clip a fixed piece high in the crack, then descend a few feet and go left, lay-back. Reach high right, and get back into the crack. Place gear before the large hollow block and climb into the funky chimney. A #4 cam fits in the top. Pull through, and set a belay at the edge. Above is a short section of 5.10 fingers and the top.\n\nHere's a pitch-by-pitch breakdown from a modern ascent:\n\nP1: From the 2-bolt belay on the NEB (P5 on the MP description), go straight up the thin corner and past a roof (12b). Continue up the flared corner with thin pro (5.10). At the top of the corner, bust left around a roof to gain a low angle handcrack, and follow this to a belay with 1 good bolt and a slung chockstone. 160'.\n\nP2: Up the obvious hand and fist crack, starting as a steep LF corner, becoming a vertical splitter with a few pods and flares. This pitch is #3 camalot sized nearly the whole way, with a few spots for smaller gear, and one spot for a larger cam (#4 Camalot). With 2 Blue Camalots, you can walk them up the entire way. Near the end of this pitch, the crack pinches down to fingers. Bust right here on good edges and big wedged flakes (felt secure) to a belay stance with 1 good bolt (backs up with #1-#3 Camalot). 5.10, 170'\n\nP3: Up a hand crack to a small OW roof. Stemming helped here. Higher, encounter another OW section, with a few helpful crimps. You could protect this section with one #4 Camalot (new style worked fine), backcleaning it after the first OW roof to use on the second OW section. After the OW, follow a wide hands crack. When it pinches down to thin hands, make a big (~40') traverse right on a narrow ledge system (the right \"arm\" of the crucifix as seen from afar). Belay at the end of the ledge at 1 good bolt, with some backup gear at your feet. 5.10, 120'.\n\nP4: Stem right off the end of the ledge (11c, super-exposed!), and up a thin corner (RPs). Continue up the corner on good fingers to another crux (11d) featuring a cool kneebar. Continue up and through more pumpy, sustained 5.10 climbing with good pro, eventually passing the huge roof on its right. Above the roof, trend left, topping out past one more 10+ crux. 180', belay off a tree.","protection":"Doubles to 3.5 Camalot.  Plus a # 5.

The climb feels a bit like\n\nThe Flakes\n\non MCR, but shorter and not quite as good.\n\nAbout 20ft left of the start of Braille Book is an outside corner with a large system of detached flakes resting against the wall. Begin by scrambling up the flakes (mind the loose rock) to reach a point beneath and to the right of a prominent roof. Climb an offwidth crack to the right of the roof and then stem across to traverse left just a few feet above the lip. Follow a crack system angling up and left to reach a half-driven pin. Tie off the pin and make a couple 5.8 moves traversing left to gain another crack system. Climb up the left side of a sort of rotten flake to reach a stance with a horizontal crack for an anchor (2-3\"). This is a long pitch and has potential for very bad rope drag if you place gear in the wrong places.\n\nThe second pitch begins with a steep flake above the anchor, then follows a corner system (5.9). After the corner wander up the face (runout), aiming for another left facing corner and roof. Move past the roof and climb easy terrain to a ledge atop some pinnacles and chockstones.\n\nPitch three climbs up beneath the bulge, then traverses left before finally pulling over. Climb the arete to the right of a roof. At this point there's probably several ways to finish. I continued up and left to a bolted anchor with mussy-hooks (I think part of Remain In Light), then climbed up and right through some sort of loose flakes. This takes you big ledges and a tree where you join up with Braille Book and every other route in the area.\n\nClimb the final 5.4 pitch of Braille Book to finish.
