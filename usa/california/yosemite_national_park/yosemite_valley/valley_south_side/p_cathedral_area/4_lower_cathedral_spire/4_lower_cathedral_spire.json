The route, however, consists mostly of wandering ledge traverses and the rock quality is not great. The climbing is not memorable, but the summit sure is. It is rather surprising such a precipitous looking spire has this easy route. Although rated 5.9, there is only one hard move, and if aided the route is rated 5.6, A0.\n\nFollow the gully east of the Cathedral Spires and GO ALL THE WAY TO THE NOTCH BETWEEN THEM! The start of this route is hard to find and numerous parties have started too low. The actual route begins only about 150 feet from the notch, so go all the way to the notch to be sure you are not starting too low (see the \"Direct Start\").\n\nFollow an intricate route up to \"Main Ledge\", a huge ledge halfway up. The first pitch is rated 5.6, and ends at a gigantic (ant infested) tree. A 4th class pitch leads to the left end of Main Ledge. If you go straight up now you are on \"South by Southwest (11a)\". But for this route, wander right on Main Ledge (3rd class), staying high. Now comes the short crux by a bolt. Make an awkward 5.9 face move (or aid on bolt) and then move up and right to easy ground.\n\nThe FA went up the menacing, thin flake detached ten inches from the wall (this flake is located somewhere above the bolt, I believe, if it hasn't fallen off by now). The mindset necessary to climb the flake bordered on insanity. First, a sharp projection on the flake was lassoed. Then the rope, hanging vertical, was climbed hand-over-hand until it was possible to mantel the projection. If liebacked, the fragile flake would have broken so out came the hammer. The leader then delicately chipped footholds into the flake while balancing his weight in an effort to keep from pulling the feature and himself from the wall. This was Yosemite's first instance of chipping, a practice that was not repeated until the sport-climbing boom in the 1980s [thanks to Chris McNamara for this historical paragraph, excerpted from SuperTopo].\n\nContinue up a pitch 5.5 and then one last 4th class pitch to the summit.","protection":"Light rack.

This is 3rd-4th class, and if you do this unroped, don't fall.  If you rope up, the biggest problem is the rope knocking loose rocks onto the belayer.  Be careful, helmets recommended!\n\nFrom the notch another 4th class pitch continues to the base of a steep vertical wall.  The next three pitches are each rated 5.9.  Follow a left facing corner up through an overhanging slot and find a small ledge on the left to belay.  P2: above lies a large left facing dihedral, the first ascent followed a crack on the left face.  Better, follow the dihedral itself, which is 3-4\" wide the whole way (Pratt-Faint variation).\n\nP3: traverse right to a strenuous vertical crack, crank up this short move (crux), follow a ramp past a scary loose flake and continue more easily to the top.  This pitch also has a variation to the left up a right facing corner (Fredericks-Sacherer variation, looks more strenuous).  Continue to the summit via one more 4th class pitch.\n\nWith 60m ropes, probably some of the crux pitches can be combined.","protection":"Standard rack with doubles in #3-#4 Camalot size for the 2nd crux pitch variation described.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"c8kovohuU+Spg553ERQYGw==","name":"Long Live The Chief (free var.
