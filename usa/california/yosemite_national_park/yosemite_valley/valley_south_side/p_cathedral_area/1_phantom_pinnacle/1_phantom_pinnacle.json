It can be done in somewhere between 3 to 5 pitches. I climbed it, and will describe it in 3.\n\nPitch 1: Climb a ramp up to a ledge (optional belay) and then climb steeper blocks and flakes in a corner past a tree to another ledge.\n\nPitch 2: A steep and wild pitch! Climb the right side of a large flake (in the corner) off the belay to reach a chimney. Chimney up unprotected and then climb into the featured corner. Different options exist here, but alternate between stemming, liebacking, face climbing, and jamming to get up the corner. I kept climbing past more ledges and trees and belayed all the way in the notch. There is a 2 piton anchor way back around the other side.\n\nPitch 3: Just when you thought 5.9 couldn't get any steeper! From the notch traverse up and left onto the north face of the spire. This leads to a thin crack with several pins in it. Lieback the flake to the left of the seam and then climb a corner with hollow plates of rock. (a #6 Camalot is useful here) Finish up an easy handcrack to the summit.\n\nTo descend, rappel the route. The first rap station is on the west side (towards the notch) of the spire and is a 3 bolt anchor (one is good). With two ropes we rapped from here to a tree on a ledge a ways below the notch. For the next rap, swing to the left out away from the spire to find a rap station consisting of a good bolt and crappy pin. From here rap to the ground.\n\nThere are probably enough trees and rap stations to rap with one rope but it would not be as nice.","protection":"I brought pro to 6\" but you could probably get by with less.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,587984eb-9d0d-54e5-9de5-b9c559f735d2,d4504c09-d32e-5f81-9aaa-a94dffc2c06a,e9371aab-7f93-5399-a941-5c3b4913bcaf","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Valley South Side","P.
