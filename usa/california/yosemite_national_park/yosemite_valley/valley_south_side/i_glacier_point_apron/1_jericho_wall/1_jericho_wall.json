The crux is a short and powerful 5.12- boulder problem, followed by a second, short, height-dependent 5.11+ boulder problem. Both cruxes can be aided at C1. The route is generally very safe, with abundant protection opportunities and thoughtful bolt placements. All anchors are bolted, except the 1st pitch and 7th pitch anchor, which are tied-off trees. The route can easily go at 5.10 C1.\n\nApproach Pitch:\n\nMost parties will want to rope up for this pitch. From the base of the ramp, scramble up the easy 30ft 5th-class ramp with sparse protection to a giant 2nd class vegetated ledge. Traverse the ledge until it becomes possible to start trending up via 5th class terrain, with few protection opportunities. Alternatively, you may follow the ledge to its end and make unprotected 5th class moves directly up near the right-side of the gully. As you climb, eventually step across the gully to a tree with slings (5.5), the first pitch starts here. DO NOT climb the actual vegetated gully.\n\nPitch 1 (5.10c, 150'):\n\nTraverse to the climber’s left to a bolted face. Climb amazing crimp rails up white rock for 50' past four bolts and one gear placement. At the angling ledge, perform a trick 5.10 mantle boulder problem move to gain a ramp, then a second 5.10 boulder problem to gain another ramp to the spacious belay ledge.\n\nPitch 2 \"Daddy Lichen\"\n\n(5.11b, 150')\n\n:\n\nTraverse the ledge about 15 feet to a splitter crack in white rock (you can’t see the crack from the anchor). Extend your first few gear placements. At a small roof at the top of the crack, clip a bolt and perform a 5.11 crux move to a featured face with four more bolts. After the last bolt, traverse a dirty ledge and climb large blocks to the anchor at a small ledge (below a huge ledge).\n\nPitch 3 \"The Traverse Pitch\"\n\n(5.10c, 50')\n\n:\n\nFrom the anchor, don't go up, instead traverse to the climber’s right to a bolt. Perform a height dependent 5.10 down-step, below the bolt, to a flake. Clip a second bolt and mantle the flake. Plug gear into a blocky crack and make a few 5.10 traverse moves to the climber's left, past some features, into splitter double-cracks to a bolted anchor and the one marginal belay stance of the route.\n\nPitch 4 \"Iron Messiah\"\n\n(5.12a, 150')\n\n:\n\nThis is what you came for! From the anchor, climb to the tree, plug some gear in the roof, take a breath and turn the arete. Soak in the exposure and climb the featured crack to a roof. At the roof, turn another arete (crux), to a stance. Build an optional belay here or continue up a juggy rail to a third roof (jeez!) and perform the final crux move around a third arete (OMG!) to a splitter finger crack, to a stance. De-pump and commit to the final 5.10+ crack to the anchor on a spacious ledge. Such an amazing pitch!\n\nPitch 5 \"The Trumpet\"\n\n(5.10c, 115')\n\n:\n\nClimb the splitter 5.10 thin hands crack to a ledge, then climb another splitter 5.10 thin hands crack to another ledge. A final aesthetic 5.10 splitter lieback takes you to another ledge and a bolted anchor.\n\nPitch 6 \"The Crispy Corner\"\n\n(5.11a, 180')\n\n:\n\nFrom the anchor, climb up a hand crack above (and to the left of) the belay and step left into the corner. Climb the burly corner to the roof, then make an unexpected crimp traverse left, around an arete (exposure!). At the tree, avoid stepping in the eroding dirt, sling the tree long and continue up the ramp to an anchor on a ledge. Careful of loose blocks at the top of the ramp.\n\nPitch 7 \"OBP\" (5.10c, 110'):\n\nClimb straight-up off the anchor and traverse to the climbers' left up past some loose blocks. Climb 4th and easy 5th class to a small tree with a sling. Clip the sling then traverse out to a bolt. Perform a crux slab traverse on cool rock, past the bolt to a splitter crack and imagine making that move without the bolt. Climb the splitter crack to a ramp and past a first tree with slings, to a second tree on a spacious ledge.\n\nPitch 8 \"The Summit Pitch aka Big Groaner\"\n\n(5.10a, 140')\n\n:\n\nThis pitch has the worst rock quality on the route and we didn't clean it. Follow the path of least resistance, but generally the pitch goes directly up from the anchor, then traverses to the climber's left (5.10a) and finishes up a blocky ramp to the summit. This pitch is heads-up but not \"R\". Ample gear exists, you just have to look for it.\n\nRappel the route with 2x 60m ropes to the tree above the big ledge with slings (official start of p1). From there, do a double-rope sideways rappel across the approach pitch and down to its start.","protection":"Mastercams: 1x gray(#00), 3x purple(#0)-blue(#1), 1x yellow(#2).

Walk east on the road (or adjacent trail) and turn right on the service road at the fork just before the Happy Isles/Nature Center bus stop. Walk up a service road (or adjacent trail), past the Nature Center, until you see either an obvious wash which crosses the service road or a wooden bridge that is visible on the adjacent trail (15 mins). The faint climber's trail starts 15 feet past the wash (on the right side of the service road), look for cairns. The trail starts by passing back through the wash then continues up the side of it (climber’s right side). Eventually it briefly dips back into the wash before cutting right and exiting onto a talus field (15 mins). The Jericho wall is visible from the talus field. Follow cairns to the base. Expect some downed trees and other debris covering parts of the trail (30-40 minutes total).\n\nOnce on the talus, look back into the forest for a very large pine tree, it stands above all the other trees. This will help you find the trail for the descent."},"__v":0},{"_id":"Z553DvbWVpe7ygDw8/kkfA==","name":"Jericho Wall","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"10/13 Mucci/Bosque","type":{"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.56381,37.72519]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"109402880","mp_crag_id":"109402875","climb_id":"Z553DvbWVpe7ygDw8/kkfA==","areaRef":"Wf0VMcNAXtq7BKLYAU2V0g=="},"content":{"description":"Jericho Wall is a fun/obscure moderate grade V in the shade.

First half is slab aiding with primarily beak tips in closed corner systems then transitions at the obvious middle tier to vertical aiding up a beautiful rightward arching roof system and then various corner systems to reach the summit. More holes than necessary were placed and I'm ashamed of that fact, but interesting and fun climbing still to be had on the route. I would not suggest this as your first route on this wall as others are better, but a worthy route after completing Epidèmia de Opiáceos and Jericho Wall. Many of the lower pitches will go free at what I assume will be a moderate grade (P2 will be the crux of attempting to free the lower pitches) and there's obvious and moderate freeclimbing possibilities up the left side of the headwall (that will connect with the anchor at the top of pitch 8) for those that are looking to create a freeclimbing variation without the need to put in anchor bolts.
