Traverse left after the first bolt to another, then follow the ramp up and right to a belay with a bolt and a piton or two. ~75 feet 5.9\n\nPitch 10: Follow a thin crack up and left from the belay about 20 feet to two closely spaced bolts. Traverse left, then up the left facing dihedral, passing a fixed piton. Climb up the face above, passing three bolts, then trend up and left to a right facing dihedral that leads to a ledge with several bolts of varying quality to belay. ~125 feet 5.10a\n\nPitch 11: From the belay, traverse out right, getting into the left-facing dihedral. Climb the dihedral, surmounting a small roof, and up into a thin splitter crack. Above the crack, there is a small ledge, and easy climbing leads to Beck's Bivy. 3 bolts for an anchor. ~110 feet, 5.8\n\nPitch 12: Easy, overgrown 5th class takes you up to a ledge that is supposed to have three pitons for an anchor. The pitons may be missing. ~60 feet, Easy 5th\n\nPitch 13: From the ledge, climb the crack to a roof. Going left is supposedly 5.10a, and leads to a large, left facing dihedral chute that eases after the entry moves. Going right under the roof follows roughly 5.8 climbing. The right side of the roof is overgrown and dirty, and then follows a good splitter crack (varying between off fingers and hand sized) which has some intermittent plants. Eventually, traverse back left to enter the large, left facing dihedral chute. Once in the chute, follow it until you can escape right on a band of smooth, white, marble-like rock that takes you to a ledge with three bolts. ~150 feet 5.10a, or 5.8 munge/bushwhacking (With a short bit of simul-climbing on easy terrain, pitches 12 and 13 can be combined with a 60m rope.)\n\nPitch 14: The aforementioned 10b section as noted on the Cummins topo is supposedly straight above the belay. I opted for easier climbing back off left. From here, route finding skills are your friend, and my pitches vary from the topo a bit. You can climb back into the chute, following that up, and continuing into a more broken ledge/dihedral system than angles up and to the right. Watch for loose or rotten rock, and pass by the occasional fixed piton. Most of the climbing is easy fifth, with possible moves of 5.7 or 5.8 strewn about. Stop and build a gear anchor where it seems fitting. I recall a fixed piton with slings on it that marked my belay. Keep your eyes peeled for a suitable rappel station as well. ~180 feet, 5.7?\n\nPitch 15: Continue up the broken ledge/dihedral system to a ledge with a bolt and two pitons for an anchor. You are now directly below the bolt ladder that continues up to Galactic Hitchhiker, and are looking up and right at the Oasis. ~80 feet, 5.7?\n\nPitch 16: Traverse right and down, then up, passing seasonally wet, heavily overgrown, and possibly muddy climbing. It's all very easy, but careful with wet shoes. The two bolts mentioned on the Cummins topo were nowhere to be found by me. They could have been in the jungle of plants somewhere. Continuing up the left-facing corner and doing it all as one pitch is reasonable and suggested. Gear anchor, or use the large pine tree. Welcome to The Oasis! ~180 feet, 5.7\n\nTo rappel the route, you need two 60m ropes. Bringing webbing or cord, as well as a knife to clean up old tat on anchors is highly recommended. Rap from the large pine tree at The Oasis to the top of Pitch 15. Then rap down, searching for a possible 3 piton rap station that was off further right from the climbing route, and lower than the single piton + gear anchor for the top of pitch 14. Other options may exist using fixed pitons on the route, but gear may need to be left to beef a lone piton up. Don't be dumb and rap off a single, old piton! From here, rap down to the 3 bolt anchor atop of pitch 13. Now rap down to Becks Bivy, which is a rope stretcher! (Optionally, you may be able to make the easy 5th class and down climb.) With two 60m ropes, I had a couple feet of rope leftover when my feet were on the ledge. Now rap down to the top of pitch 10, then another full length rappel to the top of Goodrich Pinnacle. From here, rap down Goodrich Pinnacle. Especially for the last rap gaining the top of Goodrich Pinnacle, put knots in the ends of your ropes, since many of the raps also involve a bit of traversing and can be rope stretchers.","protection":"Standard rack to 3\", a 4\" piece could be used in spots, but is not necessary.

Traverse 5' R then up to tiny R facing flake (nut) the up and L (.9) to ledge with bolt. Climb above bolt(.8) to higher ledge w/bolts. Super Classic sustained pitch. P4) 110' - .10a/b - 5 bolts + fixed peg - Clip 1st bolt just 4' from belay- then (.9) up to ledge. Go up R (cam) and traverse L on ledge to R facing flake (1 1/2\" to 3\" cams). Go up past 4 bolts (.10a/b) to belay stance w/2 bolts. P5) 120' - .10b - 3 bolts + f.p. - Climb long L facing flake(.9) then up(.8) to ledge. Go R to bolt then traverse R(ez) to 2nd bolt. 4' of 5.10 friction above this bolt to ez knobs and 3rd bolt. Traverse R to Patio Pinnacle. Climb L side to 3 bolts on top. This is probably the easiest pitch but it does have the hardest moves. Every pitch on this Super Classic modern route (2017) is well protected with maximum runouts of 10' to 15' on 5.8 or harder. This is the only well protected route on Patio Pinnacle that I know of. It's also the only route on Patio that you don't need a hammer and pegs.","protection":"1 each cam 1/4\" to 4\" + 2 each micro nut to 3/16\" + 1 each small nut to 1/4\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"4AGuNVEMWW+wkDmAfUo7lA==","name":"Blinky Blunt","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Jim Beyer- solo     11/20","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.56492,37.7323]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"120012471","mp_crag_id":"113584762","climb_id":"4AGuNVEMWW+wkDmAfUo7lA==","areaRef":"0JkjXazIUymCuLQuEm04sQ=="},"content":{"description":"About 40' left of Misty Beethoven is a crack/ seam ( 5.8 ) in a left facing corner.
