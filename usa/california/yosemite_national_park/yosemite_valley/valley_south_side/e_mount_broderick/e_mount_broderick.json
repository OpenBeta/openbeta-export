The grades listed below are my best guess and are not meant to sandbag anyone.  I believe these are the honest grades that consensus will reach as the route sees more traffic.\n\nPitch 1 - 5.10 - 160 feet\n\nStart up a thin dihedral with a bush at the start, then out or around a small A-frame roof to another dihedral with thin to good fingers to a 2 bolt belay (only bolted belay on the climb).\n\nPitch 2 - 5.11+, 150 feet - 4 bolts\n\nTraverse up and right to a bolt then continues right to a crumbly corner (5.7), then to a good ledge and three bolts (crux) traversing to the right to a ledge at the base of a dihedral.  Belay takes hand-size gear.\n\nPitch 3 - 5.11+, 70 feet\n\nHead straight up the dihedral to the start of the flake system, then undercling to the left into a radical sustained undercling fingerlock traverse to a ledge with a tree.  Belay takes hand-size gear and a #4 BD.\n\nPitch 4 - 5.11+, 90 feet\n\nUndercling/jam out the awkward flake to pumpy hand jams then powerful liebacking passed 4 fixed nuts.  Belay at a stance as the flake turns lower angle, or better yet, combine with Pitch 5.  Belay takes finger- and thin hand-size gear.\n\nPitch 5 - 5.11, 50 feet\n\nContinue up the flake to a thin crack crux through a short roof.  Belay on a good sloping ledge.  Belay takes hand-size gear.\n\nPitch 6 - 12-, 130 feet\n\nJam/lieback up the wide slightly expando pancake flake (5.9) saving a #4 BD for the belay.  After a stance, head up the stellar big fingers to thin hands corner (5.11-) to another stance.  Fire up good fingers to a thought-provoking undercling flake (crux) to a \"thank God\" slam dunk jug.  Cruise up to a good ledge.  Belay takes #3 and bomber #4 BD cams.\n\nPitch 7 - 5.10, 180 feet\n\nScramble up and right through a bush, then straight up a short awkward dihedral (5.10), then 3rd class through some trees straight up to the base of a thin corner.  Belay at one of the trees.\n\nPitch 8 - 5.9 or 5.6, 160 feet\n\nClimb up the corner to a ledge and a bush, then choose your own adventure left to the original 5.9 lieback, or right through 5.6 fingers then straight up through ever widening low-angle cracks to the summit ledge.  Belay at a big tree.","protection":"Rack: RP's, (3 ea.) finger and hand sizes, (1) #4 BD cam","location":"The route is on the right side of the South Face on Mount Broderick and can be seen from the top of Vernal Falls.
