Gain a dirty ledge and walk up and right. If you didn't place too much it would be easy to keep going\n\nP2 : Up the clean though at times awkward double crescent shaped flake (5.10). At it's end, make an exciting hand traverse left to a belay on top of a tree at two old bolts (can back up).\n\nP3 : Beautiful splitter angling to the right. Being slightly slabby makes this seem much easier than most 11c down-valley finger cracks imo. New 2 bolt anchor on ledge.\n\nProbably best to rap from the top to the ground with 2 ropes. Not sure if you can get off from the tree/old bolts with 1 rope. You'll need some tat if trying.","protection":"doubles to #3 with extra finger size.","location":"The wall to the right of Fifi buttress (warbler buttress) is pretty clear at the base (from avalanches?).
