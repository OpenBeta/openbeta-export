Some funky free climbing (best not to clip Hotrod anchor right off ledge as pro), gets you to an intermediate free-climbing belay and below the nice beak and head seam.

The movement is stellar, the protection just reasonable enough, the rock immaculate, and the position is simply brilliant. Additionally the fact that it's relatively short and low commitment makes it easier to work than many of the other routes in the area. That being said it's quite sustained and only has one pitch that isn't 5.12 or harder. Lastly, many of the pitches are a little heady to climb. This can be more or less true depending on the condition of the fixed gear.\n\nSee the aid route description for approach and traditional descent beta.\n\nPitch 1: 5.10 A0, 200' This is basically a bolt ladder with either a single hook move or a mandatory 5.10 pull to get to a crack that you can slot a red or yellow C3 in. If you're projecting the route it's nice to fix this pitch to facilitate more efficient ingress and egress. All in all kind of a chore.\n\nPitch 2: 5.12, 45' The simple liebacking at the start feels like an inadequate warm up for the crux that hits early in the pitch. Engaging stemming and palming lead to good holds and some easier moves up the corner. Take what rest you get and save some gas for a final punchy move before scrambling to the belay.\n\nPitch 3: 5.13-, 60' After some engaging stemming off the belay, (there was a fixed beak here when I did it) sprint up a section of liebacking to a stance below a small overlap. Fire off a punchy crux on good face holds and follow aging bolts to an excellent rest. Continue up the bolt ladder via more edging and face climbing until you end up on a slab with a final boulder problem guarding the exit to Guano Ledge. The boulder problem is thin and technical.\n\nPitch 4: 5.12-, 60' From the belay climb down and right by down-mantling a large jug rail. (not the chalked sloper to the right) Traverse right passing a fixed pin followed by some good gear. Execute a final hard move right onto positive holds and mantle up onto a rail via a lieback crack. Don't fall mantling as you'd wing back into the slab to your left. Place a good piece and then do a final airy edging move to gain the right-slanting rail and good gear. Savor the wild position as you sprint up and right on jugs, slopers, and heel hooks. There are a lot of fixed pins of varying quality here that can be supplemented with thin cams. Punch it through a final crux and mantle into a short vertical flare that takes you to the belay.\n\nPitch 5, 5.12- R, 40' Runout easy climbing on smooth rock allows you to gain the bolt ladder. Clip the first or second bolt and then downclimb left to execute a hard rock-over move on a good left foot. Follow this up more easy face climbing until you can clip one more bolt and gain a very thin, hollow flake up and left. Traverse underneath the base of it on easy, slightly hollow terrain to a shallow right facing flake with a thin splitter to the right of it. This is the mental crux. Build a nest of small cams in the flake and seam above and punch it up decent edges to the chains. Apparently the nest has held at least one whipper from the chains. This belay is fully hanging and kind of sucks.\n\nIt's easy to climb the bolt ladder to suss out moves, extend a bolt with a few runners, or fix stoppers in the seam so that you can eliminate the head crux. That being said, there is decent small gear and the moves are relatively easy and secure if you're strong enough to send the route.\n\nPitch 6, 5.11, 140' A long and awesome pitch and the only one on the route that feels like proper Yosemite crack climbing. Carefully pull around some wedged blocks to gain the corner crack above and enjoy varied crack climbing and engaging movement for the length of the pitch. This thing eats up medium stoppers.\n\nPitch 7, 5.12, 130' Start up some easy flare climbing on a slab until you can hand traverse up and right to an optional belay. (terrible stance) Above here traverse further right on the slab, clipping fixed pins and finessing past a couple small edges to a stance on the hanging slab below the roof. Once on the slab, get back what you can, clip a high bolt and power into and out of the huge roof above. Wild climbing on good, albeit pumpy holds will take you to the belay on an awesome ledge above.\n\nPitch 8, 5.12-, 100' The last pitch. Climb up on good holds in the corner past a cool beak jug out and right. Scramble back into the main corner and sprint up decent lie backing to a hand crack flare. The corner takes stoppers well. Crank up the flare on good hand jams and do one last tenuous move to get established at a good stance below the final roof. Dance out left under the roof until you can step onto Dano Ledge and collapse in a heap. Easy scrambling from here takes you to the wild summit ridge.\n\nI've always rapped the route. It's advanced rappelling and if you need specific beta to figure it out, you should probably just walk down the traditional gully descent, but the whole thing can be rapped with an 80 or a 70 with shenanigans. It helps if there's a fixed rope on pitch 1 and to fix pitch 7 with your tag line. The top half wasn't equipped for rappelling so we ended up having to leave slings and carabiners at the top of pitches 6, 7, and 8.","protection":"Double rack from green C3-#1 C4, single purple C3, #2 and #3 C4, 14 draws/slings, and tiny to medium stoppers.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"nl5Ui7suV+u7YuDtmBpXkg==","name":"West Face","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"FA: Warren Harding, Al MacDonald, Glen Denny (help from Les Wilson, Chris Westphal, George Whitmore) - 1961; FFA: Leo Houlding & Jim Pickles - 2001","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.64769,37.71281]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"106187777","mp_crag_id":"106187767","climb_id":"nl5Ui7suV+u7YuDtmBpXkg==","areaRef":"CmHKw8OcVJWkkZ4Ytlne0A=="},"content":{"description":"11 Pitches of overhanging exposure!  A continuously steep and strenuous route with some of the best exposure around.  The route is technically easy, but can be mentally wearing due to the nature of the climbing.  From the very start there is instant exposure.  An awesome wall to cut your teeth on.\n\nEvery pitch can be linked with a 60m rope and the hauling is really easy since the bag is almost always free hanging. Link pitches 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 for sure and it's much quicker.  These take very little actual gear.  The route goes completely clean unless any fixed heads blow.\n\nP1: C1F 120' - STEEP! Follow the bolt ladder straight up to a short C1F bulge that requires some small gear (cams, nuts, cam hooks, to 1\").  Continue up the bolt ladder to a hanging belay.\n\nP2: C1 80' - STEEP! Continue up the bolt ladder with a few 0.4-1\" placements to an OK/poor stance belay.\n\nP3: C2F 5.7 80' - Follow the crack past a few random bolts to a great small ledge belay. Mandatory free move to get onto the ledge itself or a hook move or two.  Not to bad, just awkward.\n\nP4: C1 5.6 80' - Continue following the crack up off the right side of the ledge and finish up on a bolt ladder that curves left to a mandatory 5.6 free finish onto Guano Ledge.  If bivying on Ahwahnee Ledge, move over there and haul from those anchors.  If continuing straight up, haul from Guano Ledge.  Ahwahnee is a great ledge that slopes into the wall slightly with several good bolts along it for fixing a line.  PLUSH\n\nP5: C2 100' - From the Guano Ledge anchor make a free move up to clip a high pendulum bolt.  Swing right around a corner to aid up a C2 crack.  Follow that up to a right leaning small ramp that joins a vertical C1 crack.  Follow that straight up to the belay. Don't haul here!\n\nP6: 5.7 C1 - Mandatory 5.7 moves off the belay for 20-30' no pro.  Not hard, but can be scary in aid boots.  Can't bypass with cheat stick unless you've got an extended \"Lovetron\" (ha!).  Follow the bolts as they curve left to a hanging belay. No cams needed on this pitch.  Do a single haul from Ahwahnee or Guano Ledge.\n\nP7: 5.10 or C1 140' - Longest pitch on the route.  Straight up the crack off the belay.  Gotta back clean a lot or you'll never make it.  Only 1 bolt on the pitch and it's sorta shady.  Finish on the slab at a poor stance belay.\n\nP8: C1 50' - Follow the crack up to the slab to the roof and follow up to the nice anchor.  Easy and short\n\nP9: C1+F 90' - STEEP and strenuous.  IMHO the best / most fun pitch of the wall.  Follow the fixed gear straight up a crack and up the roof.  Finish on some mandatory 5.6 after clipping some semi hidden pins to get into easy terrain.  Finishes on long sloping poor bivy ledge.\n\nP10: C2 80' - Break out the 4.5\" (#4 and/or 5 camalot) and be ready to backclean it. This pitch takes all size gear from micro to huge.  Finish on a horizontal roof traverse and keep your rope extended so it doesn't wedge in the roof for your second.  Finishes on an awesome bivy ledge for 3+.  Fix the rope well for your second.  The good anchor is 30' from the roof, but there are some intermediate bolts and pins to clip so no one takes the big pendulum ride.\n\nP11: 4th class 40' - Easy scramble up and right to the top.  Wonder around and find the rap slings off the back after any Hero Shots have been snapped.\n\nOther info:\n\nThe bolt ladders are NOT reachy (Harding was a short dude)\n\nIt is 430' from the start of the route at the dead tree to the ground (the Supertopo is incorrect and undershoots it by 30').  You'll need a minimum of a 60m + 70m rope and that will just barely make it (so I'm told)\n\nMany cracks are filled with birds and nests (swifts?), hence the guano on Guano ledge.\n\nIf you hang out on Guano Ledge, you WILL be pooped on.\n\nThe birds are in their cracks at night, dawn, & dusk, which adds a degree of excitement while climbing past them.  They mostly just squawk at you though.  Don't smack them around!\n\nThe route is mostly sheltered from storms, except Ahwahnee Ledge.\n\nRapping the route is not that hard, but requires some down aiding and swinging (mostly the first 2 pitches)\n\nThis is a VERY popular wall, so expect other people.\n\nThe route goes mostly free at 5.13b (gotta aid the first 2 pitches) - Freed by Leo Houlding and Jason Pickles in 2001\n\nMost \"mandatory free\" sections can be skipped with hook moves, but those would be substantially harder than freeing 5.7\n\nportaledges are generally unnecessary\n\nHere is an old Fish Products topo and info (by Russ Walling):\n\nfishproducts.com/topos/yost…","protection":"This route has TONS of fixed gear on it, so free biners really speed things up.\n\nStandard big wall rack:\n\nCams: 2-3 each 0.5\"-1\"\n\n2 each 1.25\"-2.5\"\n\n1 each 3-4.5\"\n\nnuts: 2 each (offsets helpful)\n\nMicro Nuts:  1 each of the 3 biggest sizes (not mandatory, but helpful)\n\nHooks: 1 cliffhanger or grappling (talon works, but not ideal)\n\nCam Hooks\n\n3 Heads: 1 each #2-4 in case fixed ones blow (or a cheat stick)\n\nLots of free biners for linking pitches and clipping fixed gear","location":"The West Face starts right at the dead tree and the super obvious bolt ladder just after the 4th class on the catwalk.

Machine head and aluminum heads above second roof.\n\nP2 anchor: two 3/8” expansion bolts  - takes 2” or 3”\n\nP3: A3 140’\n\n– Clip a good cam and then head up and left using beaks, nuts, and hooks.

Traverse left on a variety of small gear, some fixed angles and LAs. Climb a short section of expanding flakes with secure moves. Rock gets better towards anchor.\n\nP5 anchor: bomber, 2 beefy compression bolts and a 3/8” expansion bolt (not a bad place to set up a portaledge).\n\nP6 (Mini Thin Headwall): A2+ 140'\n\n– aesthetic pitch, first half follows a good cam crack, thin moves or a little pendulum get you to the next crack system.\n\nP6 anchor: Single 3/8” expansion bolt, takes a good medium cam.\n\nP7: A3 150'\n\n– A good consolation prize if you do not get to lead the previous pitch, revenge is sweet but try not to fall on your belayer’s face at the very start. A two bolt free variation anchor is 1/3 of the way up. Pendulum into the big V slot gully to the right.
