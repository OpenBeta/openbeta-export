Whatever its name, this route climbs the steep orange flakes on the face to the right of The Thief. The flakes on the first half of the route are probably not solid enough to hold gear, making this a dangerous lead. It can be toproped/top belayed after climbing The Thief all the way to the ledge.\n\nTo reach the base of the climb, scramble up 4th class on the right side of the terrace. The route begins with a bit of face climbing to reach the first flake. Handjam and then move up and slightly left through a bulge to transfer to another flake. More jamming leads to the top of this flake where a tricky traverse must be made to another flake out left. The crux is knowing where to make this traverse because it is impossible to look into the crack you are moving into. If you find the secret foot jam and accompanying finger lock its not too hard. If not, expect a brutal lieback with terrible feet on lichenous rock. Either way this flake leads up through some knobs and shelves to easier ground and the top.\n\nThe rappel anchor consists of two rusty nuts, two old pitons, and a 1/4 bolt all brought together in a giant clusterfuck of tattered webbing. From this you can rappel back to the top of the terrace with two ropes, or rappel with one rope over left to the bolted anchor on The Thief.","protection":"Pro to 3\"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,587984eb-9d0d-54e5-9de5-b9c559f735d2,95af205e-83c2-533e-8fc5-01dce9623e75,4724eed5-deba-520a-bd25-a3ada27260ed,0d35d868-4e21-5a06-aa1a-297251507d68","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Valley South Side","Q.
