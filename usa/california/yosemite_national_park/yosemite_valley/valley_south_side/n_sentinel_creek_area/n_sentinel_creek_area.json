It's dirty but has a couple redeeming pitches. The rock is mostly good and the climbing is mostly well protected. Gets morning shade. The Reid Guide calls it 5.10b, but doesn't list any info on the FFA. Galen Rowel surely used aid on his 1968 ascent, and the green Roper guide lists the route as 5.9 A1. So I don't know where the 10b rating comes from, but the crux pitch felt harder than The Sceptor (11a) to me.\n\nWe did a direct start by climbing a gully just to the right of Manana. It's possible to avoid these first two pitches by hiking uphill to the west and then cutting back left on 3rd/4th class ledges to reach the base of pitch 3. I'll describe the route as we climbed it, so the pitches will differ from what is in the Reid topo.\n\nPitch 1 (10a/b) Climb up the gully past a big tree and a ledge. The chimney pinches you out and you must make a couple big reaches between jams to get situated in the crack system above. Burly. Then follow the 6\" crack a bit to the right and cut back left to belay on a big ledge.\n\nPitch 2 (4th class) Do a little boulder problem to get up on the next ledge, and then follow the broad ledge system along the base of the wall for about 80ft to the right. Scramble up some more easy terrain and belay at the highest ledge.\n\nPitch 3 (5.8) A short pitch following the crack system up and left. Climb the double cracks with some stemming onto a big 30-degree slab. Walk to the back of the slab and belay at the base of the corner. The anchor takes nuts and 1-2\" cams.\n\nPitch 4 (5.9) Bushwhack past a small tree and then climb up the enjoyable steep corner. This would be a nice pitch if it were clean. This brings you up onto another tree covered ledge. You can belay here, or climb a bit further through a short steep section. There is a dirty crack a bit to the right which is undercut at the bottom and looks really hard to get into. I think this is perhaps the best way to go? I got off route here and climbed the crack just to the left which gains a long narrow ledge. The climbing above was hard and poorly protected so I followed the ledge all the way to the left near the arete and a small tree. I climbed up 20 ft and then traversed way back right on unprotected face climbing and features (5.4 R/X) to rejoin the route. My follower was able to climb directly up on toprope since I didn't place pro anywhere on my round-a-bout variation. Whichever way you go, there is a good spot to build an anchor (nuts and small to medium cams) at the base of the steep crack and a place to sit on the big ledge immediately to the right.\n\nPitch 5 (5.11a) Another pitch which would be really fun if it were clean. Climb up the steep hand and fist crack. It is easier than it appears thanks to several large features to grab and step on. This brings you to another ledge. It's probably a good idea to belay here if you didn't climb all the way to the base of the crack on pitch 4. Otherwise keep going into the crux \"10b\" pitch. This section is just as steep and dirty as the previous, but also much thinner and less featured. Continuous climbing in a right-leaning corner and crack with a very pumpy finish. Move left along the sandy debris covered ledges and belay by some blocks under a roof.\n\nPitch 6 (5.8) A short bit of insecure climbing up the thin crack and face reaches a horizontal crack below the roof. Traverse right to where the roof is split by a chimney and wiggle up to the top of the formation.","protection":"Pro to 4.5\", nuts and extra cams from .5\" to 2\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"jGFTCyY2UyyRJ0Y1aQl8XA==","name":"Juan-Tawn","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.60144,37.72639]},"left_right_index":9,"mp_id":"117868111","mp_crag_id":"106066238","climb_id":"jGFTCyY2UyyRJ0Y1aQl8XA==","areaRef":"EEMF+8m0XSCqbYEnB9VxNg=="},"content":{"description":"A few face moves lead to a left facing crack and flake system with a bolt protecting the last moves to the anchor.  Some loose rock and hollow flakes.","protection":"Gear to #2 bd, 1 bolt,  2 bolt anchor with webbing/rap rings - 3rd anchor bolt out left with rap ring","location":"10ft left of Yama Shama"},"__v":0},{"_id":"GUFcGvyFWn22uoR21JWbOg==","name":"Into the Fire","yds":"5.11b","grades":{"yds":"5.11b","french":"6c"},"fa":"Dan Hare and Mike O'Donnell (1983)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.60144,37.72639]},"left_right_index":19,"mp_id":"110466494","mp_crag_id":"106066238","climb_id":"GUFcGvyFWn22uoR21JWbOg==","areaRef":"EEMF+8m0XSCqbYEnB9VxNg=="},"content":{"description":"Located on a west-facing buttress just uphill from King Tut's Tomb.

The crux is the last bit of strenuous underclinging with poor feet. After turning the lip into the left-facing corner, make certain the rope is running on the outside of the roof. If the rope starts going into the crack it will get jammed and possibly drag your gear up into the crack with it. Lieback up the corner until it turns into a slab, then make another 5.9 move standing up onto the arete.

There are a couple cruxes low down on the route that are interesting and challenging, but most of the climbing is unexposed and not very fun. It's got lots of dirt and moss, but the bushwhacking isn't too bad except for a pitch near the top.

Oh, and don't attempt this route if it has rained recently and it's wet.\n\nApproach by hiking up the climbers trail to the base of Manana, then follow the wall uphill to the right. Boulderfield Gorge is the massive gully in the corner where the west facing wall intersects the water-polished north facing wall. Pharaoh's Beard should be visible a couple hundred feet to the right. On the left-hand wall inside the gully will be the overhanging 5.12 crack \"Lost and Found\".\n\nThe first few pitches lead up through three \"steps\" in the gully. Each step is guarded by a crux chockstone which must be climbed past. The first chockstone is passed on the left with some awkward jamming. The second chockstone requires some wild stemming and then a difficult mantel. The third chockstone is passed on the right with a \"pull-up\" move on a good hold. After some brief scrambling, climb onto a secondary ledge system on the left side of the gully. This avoids some mungey chimneys in the back of the main gully.\n\nA couple more easy pitches tunnel behind two large chockstones to arrive at a debris strewn ledge below the \"Colossus\". This enormous chockstone (more of just an overhanging wall) is passed by climbing features on the right wall of the chimney. Start up a left facing OW flake, make a traverse right, then straight up on more flakes to a mungy ramp with another crux move.\n\nNext is a rope-length of 3rd class up vegetated gully with ferns and thistles. Take the left gully. On the next pitch, step left to avoid scary looking chockstones and a dead snag, then bushwhack through a tree choked chimney. A couple rope-lengths of 4th class lead to the shoulder of the wall.\n\nTo descend:\n\nOption 1: Rap down the main face of the wall. Two ropes are maybe required. Bring lots of webbing and stuff to leave as you will probably be establishing most of the rappels. If you can make it to the top of King Tut's Tomb, it's only 3 double rope raps to the ground from there.\n\nOption 2: Bushwhack east and then north through breaks in the cliffs to reach the Valley rim. Hike cross-country to meet up with the Pohono Trail, which you can take to Glacier Point and either hitchhike back or walk down the 4-mile.","protection":"Pro to 4\"\n\nOr you can just bring nuts and slings if you want to be a boss like RR.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,0f1eddf1-5a79-556e-92f6-0d91627e1f2f,587984eb-9d0d-54e5-9de5-b9c559f735d2,104305fb-c9b4-5d20-aa6d-812707d57136","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Yosemite Valley","Valley South Side","N.
