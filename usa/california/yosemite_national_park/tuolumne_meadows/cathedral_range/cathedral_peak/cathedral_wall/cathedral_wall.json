Excellent steep crack climbing combined with easy alpine romping make this a fine day out in Tuolumne.\n\nThis route has probably seen some climbing on it in the past but there is no record out there. The only evidence of prior climbing seen on the FA was one old bail sling on a bush to the left of the bulk of the route.\n\nThe summit views rival that of the Southeast Buttress and may surpass them simply due to the fact that you will be all alone on this one while the crowds pile up nearby.","protection":"Double rack to #3 Camalot and stoppers. Mostly gear belays. Pitches are 35-70m long. Wear a helmet; this is not a well traveled area. Wall faces N/NW, late afternoon/evening sun.","location":"Follow directions to Cathedral Wall. From the talus field look for the right trending ramp leading towards the Orange Corner (Pitch 3). A start on low angle snow may be necessary depending on time of year."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,ce6ec458-d8d0-5439-aa24-025a8a8ec2e4,74f562f9-5586-5ad7-a8a4-7a8725da63e0,bc270abe-2ae6-5725-b652-bc2fecc8e9af,d23b12f6-bd78-5828-9d91-68c4fd136443","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Tuolumne Meadows","Cathedral Range","Cathedral Peak","Cathedral Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.40554,37.84782]},"bbox":[-119.40610944729562,37.847370339818134,-119.4049705527044,37.84826966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117702297","area_id":"0jsS9r14WCidkWjE/RNkQw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.40610944729562,37.847370339818134],[-119.4049705527044,37.847370339818134],[-119.4049705527044,37.84826966018186],[-119.40610944729562,37.84826966018186],[-119.40610944729562,37.847370339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:38.708Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:24.421Z"}
