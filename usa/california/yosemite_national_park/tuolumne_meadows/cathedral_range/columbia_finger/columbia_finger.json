Do feel free to add this to the list of contrived climbs to do on a Cathedral Range linkup…\n\nP1 climb an initially low-angle very-open book, maybe 150 feet. P2 climb the markedly steeper corner above (crux) on good rock. P3 up and right on blocky ledges; weave up through blocks along the summit ridge to the top.\n\nDescent: Downclimb/downlead back to a walkable ledge system that leads to hiking on the west side.  If you brought all your stuff with you, you won’t need to go back to the toe of the south buttress.
