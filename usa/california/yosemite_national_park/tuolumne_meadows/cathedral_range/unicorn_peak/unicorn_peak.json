Nice summit view. Interesting climbing to reach the highest N summit, but pretty short compared to the approach (shortest from the East side).\n\nDifficulty of the N summit traditionally rated class 4, but one obvious way of doing it has a slightly overhanging (or at least fully vertical) move with exposure to a deadly fall - seems more like class 5.\n\n. (If you're more of a scrambler than a serious rock-climber ... unless you're partnered with someone with a rope who knows how to use it for protection ... better to plan toward getting only the Middle summit, perhaps along with the higher mountain less than half a mile south along the same ridge as the Unicorn.)\n\napproach\n\n: Trailhead is at Tuolumne Meadows campground (along S side of highway 120 about 8 miles W from the Yosemite N.P. east entrance at Tioga Pass) near group camp, the B loop. Bear-proof boxes for day-hiker food storage.\n\nTake the Elizabeth Lake trail South about 2.3 miles / 3.7 km (with vertical gain 900 ft / 270 meters) to near Elizabeth Lake. Hike / scramble up the East (or NE) slope of the Unicorn to the notch between the middle summit and the north summit (vertical gain approx +1300 ft / 400 meters).\n\nclimb\n\n: The highest North summit is close to the notch, so it's tempting to want to \"go for it\", but it's not so easy. One way to get there is to cross over to the W side of the notch, then make an exposed short traverse N. Next up to the crest of the ridge, perhaps a little to its other side, then perhaps a delicate move up, and on to the summit. Before committing to any move, keep in mind you'll have to do it again on the way back.\n\nMiddle summit is easier climbing and less exposed.\n\ndescent\n\n: Return the same way.\n\nSome people like to also climb the (higher) hump about 0.3 miles / 500 meters to the South along the broad ridge - which is fun if you like scrambling on big granite talus.\n\nOr to play with additional exposed climbing moves, can find some in traversing the other Unicorn summits and narrow S ridge.\n\nstatistics\n\n: Total horizontal distance about 2.9 miles / 4.7 km.\n\nTotal vertical gain about +2200 ft / 670 meters.","protection":"No fixed gear in place.
