Expect adventure getting out here and climbing the route, but we were pleasantly surprised by the rock quality and cleanliness. I won't go into too much detail, because the topo made by the FA team is excellent.\n\nA few comments of my own:\n\n-The first pitch is definitely the standout crux lead. With tricky, strenuous pro and sustained climbing, this one will get you warmed up in a hurry.\n\n-It seemed pretty straightforward to link P3&4\n\n-The route faces West, so a warm day and a late start might be in order.","protection":"Again, see topo. I think gear up to #2 Camalot is sufficient (you probably don't need the \"optional\" 4\" piece).","location":"When looking at the cirque from below, Boss Man climbs the second to last tower from the left. The route starts near the tower's right side. Look for some fixed gear low on the route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,ce6ec458-d8d0-5439-aa24-025a8a8ec2e4,74f562f9-5586-5ad7-a8a4-7a8725da63e0,06b2b85a-26f2-5143-a440-3842402632aa","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Tuolumne Meadows","Cathedral Range","Peak 11,357"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.3564,37.8173]},"bbox":[-119.3569692117812,37.816850339818146,-119.35583078821878,37.81774966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106648589","area_id":"BrK4WibyUUOkQDhCQCYyqg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:40.216Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:36.368Z"}
