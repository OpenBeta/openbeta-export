About four miles of this traverse is at 12,000 ft.\n\nFrom the Toulumne Lodge, hike the trail toward Mt. Lyell.  Walk past the turn off to Vogelsang before turning off the trail and heading toward Mammoth Peak.  Cross the river and scramble up the peak's northwest side.\n\nFrom the top of Mammoth Peak, traverse south (2nd class) hitting apprx. seven high points.\n\nThe crux is a sawtooth section linking the Kuna Crest and Kuna Peak.  The rock is dangerous here, rope up and try to stay as high as you can on the formations.\n\nAfter passing the crux, walk (2nd class) south and east along terrain reminiscent of the Dana Plateau toward an increasingly visible Kuna Peak.\n\nCross a deep notch and climb to the top of Kuna Peak (3rd class).\n\nScramble down to the Lyell Fork of the Toulumne River and follow the easy trail back to the Toulumne Meadows Lodge.","protection":"Standard light and thin alpine rack.  Short rope.","location":"This Traverse starts and ends at the Toulumne Meadows Lodge.  Can include Mt. Lyell and Maclure, even Simmons if you still have more to give.\n\nMammoth Peak is easier to summit from the Tioga Road east of Toulumne Lodge so this is another start/finish option."},"__v":0},{"_id":"QM1ZB+g0VgSbSWEthJAMEw==","name":"Kuna Crest","yds":"3rd","grades":{"yds":"3rd","french":"1-"},"fa":"Walter L.
