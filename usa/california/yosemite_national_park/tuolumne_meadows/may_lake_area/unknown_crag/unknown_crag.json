Ascends the flake partially then steps left to a tips crack.  Plug a small cam or offset nut and fire a short lieback (Crux)then continue through a bulge, left facing corner, and hand crack to finish.\n\nThere are no fixed anchors and this route will require that you walk off the slab at the top.  Head up from the cliff's edge and eventually find a horizontal crack leading to the south that will allow you to walk off safely and with minimal scrambling.","protection":"Nuts and doubles from small cams to #2 Camalot.  A #3 is optional but might be nice for a couple moves.","location":"The approach is similar to that for the Tank.  Head North on the trail past May Lake High Sierra Camp.  Once a small lake is observed on the right (It may be dry late in the season) head East and drop over the ridge.  Continue North along the cliff and the route will be visible before entering a large amphitheater.  The route is climber's left of the amphitheater."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,8ab53875-745f-5076-b396-d3d84945e52c,ce6ec458-d8d0-5439-aa24-025a8a8ec2e4,ed4a1fb0-8f43-568d-be1d-b80d399049e1,c2f75ad7-a3e8-54c5-8321-6241dbe4b075","pathTokens":["USA","California","Yosemite National Park","Tuolumne Meadows","May Lake Area","Unknown Crag"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a/b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.47311,37.85007]},"bbox":[-119.47367946467237,37.84962033981814,-119.47254053532765,37.85051966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113850101","area_id":"wvda16PoVMWDIWJB2+SwdQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:34.525Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:41:09.046Z"}
