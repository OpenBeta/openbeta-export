Its also the easiest and \"safest\" of the runout routes here. Not to take anything away from Blackout but you could consider this line as an \"entry-level\" introduction to the other four routes Bachar put up 5 years prior. Same start as Cheatstone with the in-situ log \"cheat\" start (12- traverse or A0 log) and the big black streak to a slight and sloping ledge. The hardest climbing is rather well protected by good bolts with 5.10 R climbing but the 5.10 first half (50 feet) of the route is in the X-zone.\n\nOne of the best pitches of its style and difficulty anywhere.\n\nThe first half of these two routes is characterized by a committing sequence and keep-it-cool face traverse and knob balancing with your first possible (mental) pro at about 25' (Dyneema-thin sling around med size knob). Once near the sloping ledge, it is possible to place a green Alien size cam in a horizontal and an offset brass above it (but its not hard here). The first bolt is above this point and just below the first of two steep bulges. Both bolts are original 1986 vintage but, and I quote Bachar, are \"$8.00 bolts and are totally bomber\"...The bolts are eyebolt/wedge style and do appear to be quite bomber. Either I am naive or something else but I trust John.\n\nAwesome knob moves for 12' to the second bulge with the last bolt. Do  more, steeper (and cruxy) knob pulls to cool pockets until its possible to place a yellow Alien size cam near the bottom of a crack that comes down from the top.
