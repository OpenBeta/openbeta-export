Varied, with some OW, hand-jamming, chimneying, and face thrown in the mix.\n\nP1) Head up the obvious 8\" wide crack in a shallow LF corner. Small gear can be placed in a crack on the right. Belay at a nice stance with a few fixed pins and supplemental gear. 5.7\n\nP2) A section of steep hand jamming through a bulge leads to an easy chimney. Again, belay at a great ledge. 5.8.\n\nP3) A short LF corner leads to fun face and knob pulling to the top of the dome.\n\nContributor's note: If you're into chess/checkers, browse around on top of the dome for a unique gameboard in an exquisite setting!","protection":"Standard rack to 3.5\" or so.
