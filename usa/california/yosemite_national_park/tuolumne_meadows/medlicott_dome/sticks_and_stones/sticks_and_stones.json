Lieback past a insecure chimney to a finger/thin hand crack.  Continue to a great ledge with a gear belay of small to medium cams.  Excellent sustained climbing with great gear 5.10-.\n\nPitch 2 continue up the finger crack corner as it widens to off width, past a great knob.

If it weren't for all that, this would be a 4 star classic and one of the best pitches in Tuolumne. The variety of climbing, wild exposure up high, and sustained burliness make this a great and full-value climb worth hopping on if you're solid at the grade. And more traffic would clean it up a little and make it even better.\n\nClimb the left-slanting jam crack which has everything from thin hands to offwidth. At a ledge in an alcove you can either belay or link it all together into one 11a+ megapitch. Stem and lieback out the steep alcove and into some chossy rock. Climb up the steep crack with face holds and into the final corner. The corner looks crazy steep from the ground but you're actually on your feet for this part. Knob climb and lieback to a bolted anchor. A little more easy 5th class leads above the anchor to the summit.\n\nThe crux is getting up to the bottom of the finishing dihedral. There's decent pro but it's a little stressful climbing because the rock is decomposed.","protection":"To link in one pitch you want a double rack to 5\" plus tripples from .3\" to 1.5\", nuts, and a crapload of shoulder length runners.","location":"In the center of the cliff.
