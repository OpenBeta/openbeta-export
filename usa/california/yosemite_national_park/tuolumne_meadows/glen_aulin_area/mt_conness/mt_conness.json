Make sure to summit. Use this 1st route as a litmus test. If you need gear and belays on this route, turn around after the summit or plan on at least two days. Now trudge over to Conness and do the NR. Info provided on that page. After pondering bailing, go down to the West Ridge and climb back to the summit. West Ridge beta on its own page. Now if you want to make it back to your car instead of hiking out sawmill, hike along the East Ridge after exiting the plateau area and downclimbing the scree trail, looking for a low angled snow tongue just a few feet down a rocky gully.

I can't decide what is more sick...Peter Croft's onsight solo or Walt Shipley's after doing the route roped and knowing what to expect!!\n\nThe route is exciting and physical and a must do for the High Sierra tick list.\n\nPitch 1: 3 options...Center option is a groove to a roof (slightly loose) (9+, 115').\n\nPitch 2: Easiest free version is to step down and traverse right on the lower crack approximately 20' where its possible to move back up to the upper crack at a good jug in between. Clip a pin and wiggle up to a roof. Fun finger/hand crack changes to a lieback to a sloping ledge where you can go left or right to end on the upper ledge with multiple 3rd pitch options (10, 200').\n\nPitch 3: If on the right side of the upper ledge...Go up a flake to a broken left facing corner and a piton belay on a ledge (8+, 120').\n\nPitch 4: Pick the easiest run out path to the corner chimney (which you don't really chimney, stay outside) (7+, 110').\n\nPitch 5: Hand and fists in the corner to a 6-7\" OW/stem over a bulge passing old bolts. Continue up the 7-8\" OW/Squeeze with a lonely old bolt to a a good ledge (10, 150'). #3 and #4 BigBro's may be nice.\n\nPitch 6: Go right on the ledge and up the obvious left facing corner with two bolts. At the second bolt make a wild traverse right to the finger cack groove with a squeeze finish to a jumbled ledge (10-, 190').\n\nPitch 7: Move right and up a bizarre corner system with a strenuous lieback. Follow broken rock to a sloping ledge under a flared goove (9+, 190').\n\nPitch 8: Up the groove and follow the natural weakness for a 190' pitch (5.5).\n\nPitch 9: 200+' fourth class loose grooves to the summit.","protection":"Nuts/hexes, 3/4\" cams to 8\" tubes, runners, 60M rope.","location":"Approach from the back of Sawmill campground on a nice trail and past the Carnegie Institute.
