It took me 5 partners over 3 seasons of weekend trips to finish the route. The 'village' also includes those friends who aren't with us anymore. This route is dedicated to Zach Orman who died in a paragliding accident in 2013. He was an inspiring friend in my life and my thoughts were with him often while adventuring down in the canyon.\n\nThis is a beautiful 5 pitch line up an unnamed wall.  One of many such walls in the GCT. The route faces south and bakes in the sun so later season or an early start are key for the crux slab moves. The route is mostly crack climbing with some face climbing cruxes thrown in. Pitches 2 and 3 are beautiful and require a variety of crack techniques. Pitch 4 is the crux and is entirely face climbing with 4 bolts protecting the harder moves. The crux is on near vertical techy crimpy slab. After the bolts the climbing eases and follows beautiful golden edges with intermittent pro. This part is runout but never harder than 5.8. Pitch 5 features a mix of crack and face with one bolt. The route could continue to the right of the 5th pitch anchor along a weakness and then up a 30 ft slab to another massive ledge. Then there is another 300-400 ft dome above. Go get it!\n\nThe next party that goes up may want to bring some webbing and/or quicklinks and rap rings to add to the 1st and 2nd pitch anchor.

Look for a wavy right facing corner about halfway up and in the middle of the wall. This corner and crack below it are the 2nd and 3rd pitches. Pitches 4 and 5 continue up cracks and face above.

Below description is from Sevve Stember and AAJ.\n\n\"This July, I had the honor of fulfilling the mission of the Mountain Fellowship Award by establishing new routes on unnamed features near Waterwheel Falls in the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne, Yosemite National Park. Over the course of two weeks Alan Holzkopf, Scott Rysdahl, Maura LaRiviere, and I established four new routes. The most notable route, the Fortress Wall (700?, 8 pitches, IV 5.11- A2+), took us three days. To find the formation, walk down river from Glen Aulin (roughly one hour), past the prominent dome known as Wild Cat Point, until you see a striking wall on the north side of the canyon. Our route links a series of fantastic crack systems, with some exciting face climbing and tenuous glacially polished traverses, on the east end of the south face. The free climbing is high quality, with only one pitch of aid. The route is best descended by rappel.\n\nWe also established three other shorter lines. Two are splitter crack systems on a detached boulder east of the main wall. The third is a four-pitch climb that summits a smaller feature that is also east of the main wall.\n\nFurthermore, we found evidence of previously unreported routes that likely date back to the original Yosemite hardmen. The climbing here, of which I could find no information or documentation, is extremely clean and aesthetic in a breathtaking wilderness setting. The opportunity to work on new lines with great climbing partners, while looking over Waterwheel Falls and the Tuolumne River, was an experience I will remember for years to come.\"","protection":"unknown","location":"This route is located on the golden steep wall near Waterwheel falls.
