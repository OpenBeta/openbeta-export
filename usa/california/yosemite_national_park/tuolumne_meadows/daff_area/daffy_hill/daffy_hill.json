Start from a diagonal up and left crack (5.4, maybe place a #1 and #2 cam) to the first bolt then navigate between glass slick polish with exposed edges in eroded plates for the next 8 bolts. At a steepening section clip a bolt and proceed (5.8) to the upper slab and easy climbing to the anchor. Rappel with two ropes (~40M) or 3rd class off to the East down ramps. Alternatively, it can be accessed by those ramps and cracks to the east (3rd Class) to set up a TR (2 ropes) but be sure to bring long slings to extend the anchor.","protection":"8 Draws plus hardware for the anchor (2 3/8\" bolts with rap rings).
