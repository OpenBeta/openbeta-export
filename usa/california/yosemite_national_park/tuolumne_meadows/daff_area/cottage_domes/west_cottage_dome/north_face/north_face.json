Move the belay left about 20 feet on the ledge and climb the super physical corner/roof with bomber hand jams.  The crux is in the first 15 feet followed by a short, easy offwidth and then some 5.7ish hand crack climbing.  Despite great jams, lots of large holds around and great protection, this second pitch seemed really hard!","protection":"Stoppers to 3\" cams.  Extra stoppers to 1\" for the first pitch.

It starts on a ledge reached by moderate climbing that probably should be roped or belay lower than Reid's guide shows.  The first pitch is the right crack of two dihedrals.
