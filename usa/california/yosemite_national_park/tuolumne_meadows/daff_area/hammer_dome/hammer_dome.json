A large cam before the first bolts could be handy.\n\nRappel from bolted anchor or continue a steep knobby and possibly mossy second pitch 5.9 with no protection bolts to another anchor.

The first two bolts protect the 12d section. These are easy to pull through, and then the rest of the route is 10d. However, getting to the 3rd bolt is a no-fall zone but the climbing is pretty easy. Then it is basically just surfing the knobs for 100ish more ft. There are a couple of punchy sections, but none of the climbing is too bad. Once the cliff starts rounding out there will be two rap rings on the left. We were not able to rap with a single 80m, and had to use two ropes. Felt the climbing (once we pulled past the 12d) was as good if not better than Shadow of a Doubt.

Follow the ramp up and R to a bolt and a pin. (note: it looks like someone has added an extension past the original finish). There was quite a bit of lichen on this, so not sure how often it is climbed, but it is a beautiful location, super quiet, with fun climbing and big clean fall potential.","protection":"Several bolts supplemented with a couple cams (green and yellow alien, 0.4, 0.5, #1, and #2 sufficient).","location":"Hike about 15 min down-stream from Hammer dome proper, keeping an eye out for walls on the right.
