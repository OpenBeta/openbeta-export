The crux lies at about the 15 foot mark, and the crack never gets more than four feet off the ground.\n\nUnless you have big fists, the only solid jams are about a foot deep in the crack. In my opinion, this is one of the best crack problems in the park. WAY worth the hike (and drive if your coming from the valley).","protection":"Long sleeve shirt, Tape.
