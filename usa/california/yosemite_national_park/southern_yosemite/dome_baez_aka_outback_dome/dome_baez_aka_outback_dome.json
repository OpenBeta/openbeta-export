Hop on, it's better than it looks from the ground! We thought it might go at 5.7 if cleaned up, but did 5.8ish moves to avoid loose blocks and vegetation. It takes a repertoire of moderate climbing moves to top out, very fun.\n\nIf you know of a prior history of this line  let me know and I'l update the description. I would be surprised to find nobody had climbed it yet, but for its long approach, and the fact most climbs recorded here are much more advanced than this.\n\nAlso check out the 30 foot vertical splitter hand crack, just right of the start of this one.","protection":"Trad rack.","location":"Just left of the lowest southwest point of Dome Baez, with Walkabout around the corner to the right.
