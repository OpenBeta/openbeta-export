An excellent pitch that makes use of a perfect knob at the 2nd bolt to make for a just there crux reach for a jug. Can plug in a #0.3 then it's bolts to the previously mentioned anchor. recommended.\n\nP2: 5.10 - Heads up the moss streak above. I wonder if this pitch was ever clean, would take a big effort to do so. It's still climbable as the knobs stick out of the moss layer but a little more freaky. An otherwise amazing and long pitch. Skip a bolted anchor out right towards the top and head up left to another bolted anchor below the hole. A #0.5 is nice below a knob tie off on this pitch.\n\nP3: Truly unique - have never seen a tube like this in granite.Â pretend you're tunneling through a rime mushroom on Cerro Torre. After emerging, head up and right passing some bolts and gear options, eventually making it to the top of the cliff and a rap anchor (one bolt needs a quicklink/ring, and a knife to cut tat). A little runout but gets easy.\n\nRap the route with 1 60. Frist rap is to a bolted anchor left of P3 in a cave. Then to the bottom of P3. Then to an anchor on the route to the left. Then to the ground (careful with a 60).","protection":"Light rack from tiny -> #2. 14 draws.","location":"This route (and others) starts off a sloping ledge up and left of the main Blue Moon area.
