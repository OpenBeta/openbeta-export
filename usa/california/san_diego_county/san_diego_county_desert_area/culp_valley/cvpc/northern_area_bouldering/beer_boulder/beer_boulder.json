Start low on a left quarter-pad crimp and right on a sloping half-moon shaped dish. The right foot is FAR away, you have to press on it hard to pull your hips up. Pull off the ground to gain a right sidepull crimp above, then gear up for a monster bump to the jug-shelf above. The climb is basically 3 difficult right hand bumps and a mantle. Every move is it's own crux. Hard, sharp, small holds and lots of body tension, but very cool movement.","protection":"Multiple pads, no spotter as you're landing on another boulder right behind you.","location":"Start at the north-west lookout area, and head south-east on trail for maybe 500-600 feet, then turn off trail and go uphill. The beer boulder is hidden and halfway uphill on the south-west facing hill with the huge boulders at the top. This climb starts dead in the middle of the face, wedged between the 2 boulders. The rock is a specific red shade that contrasts with surroundings."},"__v":0},{"_id":"fKzbFEueWimiZjC3dxzuZA==","name":"Butter n Beer","yds":"V1+","grades":{"yds":"V1+","font":"5","vscale":"V1+"},"fa":"Zach Lane - Feb 2020","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.45358,33.22742]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"118577569","mp_crag_id":"118577547","climb_id":"fKzbFEueWimiZjC3dxzuZA==","areaRef":"nMNnsmrSWliF1KuuI9LHdQ=="},"content":{"description":"Starts on the lowest right side of the boulder(if looking at the face) with a low left sidepull and a higher right hand pinch.
