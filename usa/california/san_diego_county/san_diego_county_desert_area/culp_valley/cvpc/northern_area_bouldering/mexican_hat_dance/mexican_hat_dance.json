Very fun! Sit start low to the right with left hand on a sharp corner and right hand on a lower right sloper/dish, either get a high right heel to pull off the ground or throw feet in front of you on a lower shelf thatâ€™s far away but positive. Follow the Arete up to the apex of the boulder and mantle directly up. There is a stand start that goes about V2- that starts with left hand out on the lowest obvious hold.
