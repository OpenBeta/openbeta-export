Good warm up for the namesake problem. 3 stars for movement, but gave it 2 because I feel it may be a bit contrived as one avoids the top during the beginning sequence.\n\nStart matched on jug, left hand straight up to sloper. Right hand reaches right to good rail. Cross left hand to a comfy pinch. Set feet for a lurchy reach to the huge jug/sidepull/flake inside the talon. Left hand sweeps to good sidepull in a small pod near the top. Work feet into a good knee bar in the talon. Grab what you can on top w/ right hand. There's a good/obvious flake for the left, but its bendy- just an inch or so behind it is an edge that works. Right foot crosses high to the good black spot and left foot sweeps higher to the small pod you had earlier, press out the mantle.","protection":"A pad that won't blow away","location":"Sit start left of talon on obvious right facing sidepull jug."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,06ef17a3-29aa-56c6-b227-4e49cb91e070,7024e756-1df4-50fb-8b0f-21f8f8c3f0f9,7a833697-725f-549e-95e3-8d5ad4b9a149,a1f31c5f-66d0-55f4-adb4-e1d8d8964b30,7ea0b7cc-8829-5fe7-a528-2b334920ecae","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Diego County","San Diego County Desert Area","Culp Valley","CVPC","Talon Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4-5"},{"count":1,"label":"V1-2"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.45256,33.22276]},"bbox":[-116.45309751949888,33.22231033981814,-116.45202248050111,33.223209660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109208840","area_id":"fqC3zIgpX+elKCszSSDsrg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.45309751949888,33.22231033981814],[-116.45202248050111,33.22231033981814],[-116.45202248050111,33.223209660181865],[-116.45309751949888,33.223209660181865],[-116.45309751949888,33.22231033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:37.486Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:31.725Z"}
