Pitch 2 is one of the more serious pitches in the area in terms of difficulty and bolt spacing.\n\nP1 5.9 (Little Chicken, 80'):  Start from the ledge as for Stellar Crack and traverse left and up, following the bolts.  First move is protected by a medium nut.  Follows a series of overlaps and right facing dihedrals.  Anchor is way out to the right making the exit exciting for the second.\n\nP2 5.10d (Unfinished Business, 120'):  Head up broken rock to a ledge from where it is hard to continue due to undercut feet and small hands.  Up and a step left from here.  The route gets progressively easier until a headwall is reached.  The headwall is entertaining with a slight overhang but good holds.","protection":"Medium nut for start, to protect leftward traverse.  Easy but dangerous without the nut.\n\nIt may be wise to place a cam before the headwall is reached as it is run out but easy to the headwall bolt.  I just ran it out so I can't say what size would fit but medium is a good guess from looking around.  It is good to place a longer quickdraw on the first headwall bolt to avoid drag.","location":"Left side of Stellar Crack ledge.
