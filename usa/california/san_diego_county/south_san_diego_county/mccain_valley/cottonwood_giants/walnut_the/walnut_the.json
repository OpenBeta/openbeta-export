Move around to the slightly overhanging east face then exit the crack onto crimps and move up to the rounded lip to make the delicate mantle finish.\n\nLarger individuals may find certain sections of the crack too small to fit their fingers in, which makes the start tricky.\n\nSmaller individuals may find a few of the final crimp moves a bit of a reach, which can make the end tricky.","protection":"pads for final move only.
