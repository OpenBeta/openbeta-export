Start at the right side of the moss and follow the slab to a right-slanting crack.  Climb up and left over the crack and continue up the slab.  High on the route there is a vertical crack on the right.  Either use the crack or stay to the left.  The crack offers opportunity for protection above the last bolt but the climbing is low angle and very easy at this point.  The anchor is just above a horizontal where the face steepens, to the left of the aforementioned crack.  Be aware that this climb is longer than half a 60m rope, even with standard rope stretch!  Tie a knot in the end before lowering; for top-roping and lowering the belayer should be to the climberÂ’s right to shorten the overall distance.","protection":"6 bolts + bolted chain rappel anchor. 6th bolt to anchor very run out (~15') but easy.","location":"Far left side of Sundagger"},"__v":0},{"_id":"zZK/bvaRXvGe5kDNBQC9dg==","name":"Saladthe","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Jeff Brown and Pat Pidgeon","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.07191,32.62226]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107058411","mp_crag_id":"106370371","climb_id":"zZK/bvaRXvGe5kDNBQC9dg==","areaRef":"1h/ytJ+VW9GYhE+SBCySAg=="},"content":{"description":"A nice contrast to the pumpy routes on patina wall, you have to rely more on your feet than your hands.
