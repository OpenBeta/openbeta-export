Crux just off the belay with some moderate liebacks/gastons, a really good elevator move on good holds, super strenuous high-feet liebacking to a roof that's way easier to pull than it would appear.  Eases up a bit to the belay, fun hanging off another dike. (Indicated and probably 12a, can french free if needed)\n\nP5 is a bit gritty and slabby then has an obvious crux with two ways to get past it depending on your strengths.  Pretty much blank and you'll be hanging from slopers either way.  Also difficult to french free.
