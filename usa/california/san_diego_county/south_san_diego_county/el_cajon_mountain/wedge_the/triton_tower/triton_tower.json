It was featured on the cover of Rock and Ice in 2005 and is worthy of all the praise it has received since then. After falling prey to a rather prolific bolt chopper, the route was graciously re-bolted by Mike Maiden and Gordy Schafer. For a route that has been called \"the best pitch of 5.12 anywhere\", Resistance sees much less traffic than you'd expect.\n\nAccording to Randy Leavitt:\n\n\"\n\n[Pockets of Resistance] is a brilliant combination of huecos, pockets, cutter edges, gastons and arete climbing. It is varied, exciting, technical and a little pumpy. I believe it is the best rock climb in San Diego. If you aspire to climb this grade, you should get on it. I originally rated 12b, but I am getting enough 12c ratings (and rave reviews), that I think 12c is closer to the grade of the climb\n\n\"\n\nThe best way to approach the bottom of the route is to climb Supply Line to Not So Grassy Ledge, then hit the anchor just right of the Swiftness. It is also possible to climb Triton Tower and continue the traverse to the appropriate anchor.\n\nTo work the route from the top down, the best method is to climb the first two pitches of Triton Tower with a 70m rope, then Climb the next pitch, traverse over to the anchor for Pockets of Resistance, clip in and lower as you hang the draws and figure out the sequence.","protection":"Quickdraws for 11 bolts and a 70m rope.
