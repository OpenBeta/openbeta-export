Almost every hold is large, and almost none of the holds are down pulls. This route will test your core & upper arm power while leaving your fingertips mostly unharmed.\n\nStick clip the first bolt. Climb directly up the slabby dihedral & over a bulge to a huge mantel shelf where you can catch your breathe. A really fun v5ish boulder in & of itself. (there is an alternate easier start to the left, not recommended).\n\nClimb easily up a couple body lengths of jugs, leading into much harder climbing above the 4th bolt.
