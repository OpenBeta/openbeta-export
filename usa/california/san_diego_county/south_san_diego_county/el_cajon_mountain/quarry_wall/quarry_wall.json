It's a fun little line to satisfy your need to place medium to large cams but you will have to be creative to make it any harder than a 5.7 bouldery move near the top. I lead it on some chossy holds and just rappelled down an easier line for my followers. Definitely will just go to the main wall of the mountain right away next time.","protection":"Easy trad anchor at the top if extended with runners. I used cams and nuts from .75\" up to 2\" to protect rolling back of off lead but nothing will protect you from a ground fall.","location":"Follow the line leaning starting from the most challenging start to a crux ending with flat face. Far left of the dirt base in the quarry. To the left of it there is brittle rock and then a dirt hill to the top. To the right of it, 5.Easy blocks of rock to get to the top."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,06ef17a3-29aa-56c6-b227-4e49cb91e070,3e6d010b-b832-544e-b649-c3caf17b47dd,4d5effa6-9808-57b5-bcfe-e186d7c75dae,538adc0c-8510-5924-8e36-f2a6a6b09634","pathTokens":["USA","California","San Diego County","South San Diego County","El Cajon Mountain","Quarry Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.82453,32.89269]},"bbox":[-116.82506550790514,32.89224033981814,-116.8239944920949,32.893139660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106108484","area_id":"U4rcDIUQWSSONvKmprCWNA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.82506550790514,32.89224033981814],[-116.8239944920949,32.89224033981814],[-116.8239944920949,32.893139660181866],[-116.82506550790514,32.893139660181866],[-116.82506550790514,32.89224033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:55:34.606Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:30:56.125Z"}
