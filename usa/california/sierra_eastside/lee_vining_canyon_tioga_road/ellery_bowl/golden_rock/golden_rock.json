It sits by itself (actually there are two or three other climbs of lesser quality) far above Ellery Lake which in turn is just a few miles outside of the park along Hwy 120. Park, cross the dam, and hike up the steep, loose slope to the lowest tongue of rock that is usually guarded by a steep patch of ice/snow. Why did you endure this grueling 45 minute slog for just two pitches?\n\nP1: Ascend a beautiful pitch of crisp, white Sierra granite. The crux is bouldery but well protected with a small cam and some wires. Up higher its nice to have a very large cam to protect some wide cracks, but this section is quite easy. A final, wild move around the corner to the right leads up to a bolted belay. 5.10+.\n\nP2: Start directly (sketchy gear and rock) or move right then back left (a bit dirty). Climb the long, leaning, overhanging splitter via jams and liebacks. Sandbag 5.11b; outstanding!\n\nTwo double-rope (or a single 80m rope) rappels from nice ASCA hardware gets you back down.","protection":"Single set from 0.2 to #4 Camalots, 3 each 0.75's & #3's, wires, a few draws/slings. A #4.5 Camalot (#5 C4) not mandatory but highly recommended. Two ropes or a single 80m rope. The route is north-facing and can be chilly in the wind.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"qRGa+qASXDu/PKFvsf9wMg==","name":"Moose and Squirrel","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Michael Forkash, Lezlie Armstrong mid 1980s","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.23272,37.92796]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"112038120","mp_crag_id":"112032226","climb_id":"qRGa+qASXDu/PKFvsf9wMg==","areaRef":"35J4EpomUwirSiHykI5yrg=="},"content":{"description":"An alternative second pitch variation to \"Speed of Life\" that starts off the first belay of that route.
