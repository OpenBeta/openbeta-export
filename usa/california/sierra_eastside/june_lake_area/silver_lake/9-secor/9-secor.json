If some party bolts this route and leads it\n\nand\n\nsupplies a careful description of the size and metal-composition of the bolts and hangers - (by posting an Improve This Page or a Comment below) -- they wlll be given first-rank FA on this page. Also they can supply their own name for this climb (which is why currently this route has a \"generic\" name, awaiting installation of hardware).","protection":"Top anchor is 2-bolts-connected-with chain, with two carabiners.\n\n. . (All bolts + upper hangers are 304 Stainless steel, 3/8 inch, but lower hanger, carabiners, chain, and quick-links are plated steel - installed in 2017.\n\nNo intermediate bolts for leading as of 2017.\n\nTop-Roping: Currently in 2017 there is a static line attached to a tree, which could be used to help create a temporary anchor for Top-Roping.\n\nFor ideas how to get access to top of the cliff to set up top anchor for Top-Roping,\n\nsee the description page for sector Secor\n\n.\n\nnote: The two anchor bolts are vertically offset, so cannot just connect two quickdraws for lower-off or top-rope as many American sport climbers are accustomed. Consider bringing a sling or climbing accessory cord with one or two carabiners or quick-links.\n\nIn case anchor hardware is damaged or missing or otherwise inadequate, recommend to carry a few feet of 8mm climbing accessory cord and at least one quick-link.\n\nProtection for trad Leading is unknown and likely inadequate.","location":"Below rock tongue which forms the left side of the lower right crack. This tongue is below a high crack, and above left from obvious low left-facing flake.\n\n- - >\n\nsee on this Photo"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,28ecf9b8-3e02-54f1-9a23-26c5d4120483,2d851305-4237-55da-9626-16bb345bb0ad,85ff83a4-59fa-5e29-a266-ac1e73e33385,1791910d-d646-54cd-8290-0e02ea9f6c21","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sierra Eastside","June Lake Area","Silver Lake","9-Secor"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.6"},{"count":3,"label":"5.5"},{"count":2,"label":"5.7"},{"count":2,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":5,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":5,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":10,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":10,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":10,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.12889,37.77417]},"bbox":[-119.12945887956597,37.773720339818134,-119.128321120434,37.77461966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112288315","area_id":"F5GRDdZGVM2CkA4C6p9sIQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:23.347Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:16.506Z"}
