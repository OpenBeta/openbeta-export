(If doing this Variation on Top-Rope, make sure to set directional protections on the two bolts which are below the top anchor).\n\nOne more bolt then finish to two-bolt anchor with ramshorn.\n\n. . If continuing on higher to sector Moynier, the leader can scramble above the top anchor about 25 ft to a tree, which as of 2018 has a static rope attached that could be clipped as an anchor (but then likely still want to belay the followers from the lower two-bolt anchor).\n\nwarning\n\n: The rock on and near this route has not been climbed much yet, and some of the rock is still breakable and loose -- so the belayer and other people should stand far away from underneath the climber.","protection":"10 intermediate bolts for leading up to bolt anchor.\n\n. . .

This is to avoid dangerous loose rock along the line directly up the corner. To avoid rope drag, the Leader could consider using longer draws just before and after the move left. If climbing on top-rope, could be good to clip the climber's rope through quickdraws placed on those bolts, to guide the climber away from the loose rock.\n\nTop-roping\n\n:\n\nThe top anchor is designed so that a belayer on the ground can stand way off to the left, which reduces the chance of getting hit by a loose or breaking rock.\n\nwarning\n\n: To reduce the chance of a falling climber on top-rope swinging down sideways, clip the climber's rope through a quickdraw placed on the bolt immediately below and right from the top anchor, as directional protection.

The mid-way anchor is close under some trees above left from the right-facing corner (below and quite a ways left from the mid-way anchor for \"Salamander\").

Also might reduce side-swing if the climber on top-rope falls on one of the \"corner\" moves in the lower half.\n\nSince this route has no intermediate bolts for leading, each anchor is most obviously reached by leading (or otherwise climbing on) the climb to the right (\"Salamander\"), then rappelling or getting lowered or down-climbing on below from one of the anchors on that route.\n\ndirections\n\n: Start at the base of the large right-facing corner which is at the right side of big overhang.
