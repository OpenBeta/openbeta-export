Start on the low angle face just left around the corner from Riding Dirty. You might need to hop off the ground to get started. Grab opposing sidepulls. Stand up to a good right handhold on the arete, then move up and left to a weird slab finish that gets you stretched out and feels pretty insecure.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"SYgqvtczVuubAv8442SJsw==","name":"Riding Dirty Left","yds":"V8","grades":{"yds":"V8","font":"7B","vscale":"V8"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.08179,37.79368]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119188277","mp_crag_id":"119143165","climb_id":"SYgqvtczVuubAv8442SJsw==","areaRef":"mX63+0MPW3y40nv+OoN3nA=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the same crimp rail as Riding Dirty. Match the sloper up and left, then make a crux move to a hold on the left arete that's not quite as good as it looks. Finish straight up and over. Requires an interesting combination of power and finesse, and definitely helps to have cool temperatures.
