It's not quite as classic as that problem, but still fun and worth getting on.\n\nSit start at a low big jug. Reach up left hand to a good two or three finger pocket (the belly button) and then make a big move with the right to a jug sidepull about 8 inches from the crack. Then move up and left through the buldge on good holds that might be difficult to identify. It's easy for the grade if you use all the correct holds. Finish the same as the Undercling Problem.\n\nThe crack and wall to the right is all \"off\".
