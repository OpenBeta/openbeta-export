Stand up high using a tiny crimp or some other desperate features on the left side of the golden patina. Then grab a good undercling and hang on. Much easier climbing on solid holds leads the rest of the way up the tall vertical face.\n\nIt's kinda hard to grade the upper section. I don't think any moves are harder than maybe 5.8, but it has the potential to get pumpy if you spend too long feeling around for the good pockets. If you have any doubt, try it on a rope first.
