Stand start at a hueco at the lip of the roof, using an interior pocket for the right hand and edge of the hueco for left. Pull on and get a heel, reach to the arete and climb up some big holds. Get established on incut edges then traverse left onto the face, finishing up somewhat boldly on decent pockets and edges.\n\nThe high jump start to jugs on the arete is supposedly V4.

Start on the same hueco as The Road and traverse left along the lip of the roof on big holds. Once you reach the start of Last Man Standing, finish straight up that line. Steep and juggy for the first half, thin and vertical for the second half, awesome climbing throughout.\n\nThe Countdown avoids the first powerful campus move of LMS, but requires several more moves of steep climbing which adds a bit of pump, making the crux thin pulls feel slightly harder when you get to them. Probably a little easy for a V9 though.\n\nYou can also start sitting in the back of the cave and climb the hard compression moves of \"The End of the Road\" and link all that into LMS. This is called The Final Countdown (V12), and might still be the hardest established problem at Hartley.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"DZyc+CAOWsWtbiu77AyMPA==","name":"Bachar Ladder","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.04559,37.7963]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"119225417","mp_crag_id":"118996203","climb_id":"DZyc+CAOWsWtbiu77AyMPA==","areaRef":"G+SFuJJ5UYmN7cr7qRJe4Q=="},"content":{"description":"If this had a good landing it would maybe be even better than The Road. Awesome climbing on perfect rock.\n\nStart standing at the same hueco as The Road, with an interior undercling pocket for the right hand. Do the same first few moves getting established on the arete, then split off right to a couple big crimps. Continue up and right along the overhanging west face of the boulder past two powerful reaches. At the lip, mantle over to the right.\n\nIt's got really big holds the whole way, so if you're strong enough it can feel really secure and easy. You can also step off onto the boulder behind you at any point, so you can work the moves without fear of becoming committed. However an uncontrolled fall could possibly be very unpleasant, and it can get pumpy by the end, so don't take it too lightly.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,28ecf9b8-3e02-54f1-9a23-26c5d4120483,2d851305-4237-55da-9626-16bb345bb0ad,f93002d8-f872-5865-8cea-8b03e9dd2caa,952dc940-bf02-5f41-ae03-03edde1b8a30,ddfedb2b-fe58-5f09-99d0-b0a2b16ba338,1be485b8-9279-5189-8ded-cafba9125ee1","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sierra Eastside","June Lake Area","* June Lake Bouldering","Hartley Springs","Road Boulder Area","Northwest Face"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V6"},{"count":1,"label":"V8"},{"count":1,"label":"V9-"},{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":5,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":4}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":4}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.04559,37.7963]},"bbox":[-119.04615904993685,37.795850339818145,-119.04502095006313,37.79674966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118996203","area_id":"G+SFuJJ5UYmN7cr7qRJe4Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:33.088Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:27.642Z"}
