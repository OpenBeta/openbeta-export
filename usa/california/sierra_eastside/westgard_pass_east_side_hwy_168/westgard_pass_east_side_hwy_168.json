Or if you cheat around to the right for a couple of moves on a decent finger rail, the route goes at about 5.9.\n\nOnce achieving the ledge halfway up the route, do another reachy/cruxy move to get up where there is an obvious narrowing of two small angling roofs where you will climb between them in the narrow spot.
