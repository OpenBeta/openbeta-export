The last three bolts climb through slightly overhanging 5.11 territory to a triple bolt, triple steel biner lower off.\n\nNote: The half ton block wedged half way up the dihedral was found to be solid. However, its' precarious appearance gave much pause. After a hardy struggle trying to remove it with a large crowbar to no avail, I decided to secure it with two large bolts and a short piece of high test chain.","protection":"The route has eleven bolts, three of which are fixed draws.
