It starts at the top of the scree slope which makes a horrible belay spot. Climb crimps up to the second bolt then awkwardly pull into the undercling and make a long reach up left to a crimp.  Paste your feet on the tiny edges and deadpoint for a good edge. This first crux is hard and somewhat heady since your feet are above the second bolt and the ground ain't that far away.  At the third bolt another long dynamic move to an edge, followed by a hard gaston move at the fourth. After this its easy climbing up the arete if you can still hold on. Hard for the short.","protection":"6 quickdraws to open shuts","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"kxaZJQbdWIiJWGZQaniprA==","name":"Dancin’ Fool","yds":"5.13a","grades":{"yds":"5.13a","french":"7c+"},"fa":"Luke Potter, 5/2019","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.57388,37.52286]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"117000527","mp_crag_id":"105843701","climb_id":"kxaZJQbdWIiJWGZQaniprA==","areaRef":"rn6ImUexVUWMNkdhxplSQQ=="},"content":{"description":"An aesthetic line in a unique position, the entire climb is directly over the river.
