The crux comes after the first bolt and there is a good chance of crapping out if your partner in crime is not belaying from the correct spot.  It is tempting to belay from the anchors atop Return to Forever, but this will introduce enough slack into the system that decking from the crux becomes a much greater possibility.  Instead, belay off gear at the top left end of the Hotcake Flake, perhaps 15' up and L of the RTF anchors.  Cheating like I don't know how, it is possible to place some sus gear between the first bolt and the crux (red or gold Camalot, red or brown Tri Cam).  The gear above the crux is widely spaced but the falls would be clean -- you won't see the time flashing by.\n\nDescent: rap 100' to the top of the Hotcake Flake, then rap 50' from there to the ground using the Return to Forever anchors.","protection":"6 bolts, 2 pins and some smaller gear -- sixes and sevens and nines.","location":"On the left side of the Santana Pillar.

The upper cruxes are somewhat atypical for the gorge -- off vertical technical face moves.  There are anchors after the 8th bolt (if you rap here, it takes work to keep your ropes out of the river), but for full value, keep going onto the Abraxas finish, 8 more bolts of vertical face (rock quality deteriorates a little) with a 10d crux near the end.
