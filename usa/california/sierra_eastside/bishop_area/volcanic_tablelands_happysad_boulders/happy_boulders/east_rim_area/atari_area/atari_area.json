What starts off as a wide sloping bear-hug style arete, eventually becomes narrower and less secure. Most beta involves heel-hooking one side of the arete (generally the right side) as you squeeze the arete and pull off the ground. Keep your eye out for marginal foot smears as you pull off the ground and again higher up. There is no real defined crux, however reaching a critical thumb-pocket high and right allows you to adjust your feet and work your left hand up before eventualy throwing for the lip.","protection":"There are multiple ledges that you can land on to the right of this climb. Ideally, you should have a pad on each of them and a couple spotters: one just at the base and one down below in case you pitch off the first ledge. Beware of the fall on this climb... legend has it John Sherman fell while lunging for the lip, taking his spotter out with him for the plunge into the talus below (which I assume was well padded).
