A healthy sandbag at 5.9 by the first ascent party; modern climbers seem to find terrain no easier than 5.10c.\n\nP1) Runout slab up to the big right-leaning corner. It is probably best to stop and belay at the base of the corner. We linked with the corner above for a long 60M pitch, and rope drag sucked. 5.9R\n\nP2) Right leaning corner that varies from tips to hands, belay on a large flake/block above. 5.10c\n\nP3) Up the right-facing corner to a sloping belay ledge. 5.9. There is a mysterious 2 bolt (3/8\") anchor 20' up and left on the face from here that could also be used - this is not indicated on the topo.\n\nP4) Up and right on easy runout face and slab to a ledge with broken blocks. 5.4R\n\nP5) Step around the corner and up through a large bush, then straight up cracks. A couple fixed pins near the end of the pitch protect a few thin cruxes. Old 1/4\" bolted anchor. 5.10\n\nP6) Thin face off the belay to a crack, then more fixed pins protecting thin cruxy sections. Work up through steep and somewhat runout chickenheads to a belay ledge. 5.10 PG\n\nP7) Steep chickenheads lead to an airy traverse out right onto the edge of the arete, then follow a wide hands crack through a short chimney pod. Belay at a marginal stance inside a crack after you step left. 5.7R\n\nP8) Up and right following cracks to the summit ridge. 5.7. From here, unrope and walk around the summit block. Solo up/down the exposed and unprotected 50' summit block on it's SW side, 5.5.","protection":"Double rack from tiny to 3\", a handful of fixed pins, one bolted anchor (1/4\"). Lots of bail slings exist on the route..","location":"Starts up a clean right-leaning dihedral, left of the prominent Rowell/Belden Open Book Route.\n\nTo descend, we took the first major gully to climbers left of the summit - this required numerous single-rope rappels off trees and chockstones with some easy downclimbing to get back to our packs at the base. Straightforward and quick with many slings already in place. According to the guidebook, the second gully to climbers left is possible to descend without rappels."},"__v":0},{"_id":"/XCXQdBBVXSyf7nJKhrntQ==","name":"Chicken of the Sea (aka North Ridge)","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"Galen Rowell & Chris Vandivier 1974","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.65396,37.45175]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"111185468","mp_crag_id":"111185458","climb_id":"/XCXQdBBVXSyf7nJKhrntQ==","areaRef":"CVV+oUHlX2GVcLF9zcKglw=="},"content":{"description":"Follow the north ridge of Hot Tuna Tower. Much 3rd and 4th class scrambling with short (<50') sections of 5th class. The summit block is likely the crux of this route. Ascend the S/SW side of the summit block on some slab and sweet chickenheads. No anchor on top, downclimb the block to descend. I then followed the ridgeline south over the next sub-summit, and dropped off NW into the gully behind the towers. This is a good option if you are carrying all your gear with you, otherwise descend as per Croft/Lewis - \"drop east down the second gully south of the summit, some rappels may be required.\"\n\nThis route is easily reached from the top of Soaring Eagle Tower, and allows for a fun solo linkup of the two towers.","protection":"Light alpine rack.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,28ecf9b8-3e02-54f1-9a23-26c5d4120483,58a4c1de-fc5b-5e0c-89ad-ab28ac59e4fe,66dfc688-22f2-5ebd-a9f6-b768a579b134,da61c260-03c4-525d-9e34-907d943e4a7c,09557ea1-41e5-5f61-9570-b17dcdc2a097","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sierra Eastside","Bishop Area","Wheeler Crest","Mayfield Canyon Towers","Hot Tuna Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.65396,37.45175]},"bbox":[-118.65452641844615,37.45130033981813,-118.65339358155387,37.452199660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111185458","area_id":"CVV+oUHlX2GVcLF9zcKglw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-118.65452641844615,37.45130033981813],[-118.65339358155387,37.45130033981813],[-118.65339358155387,37.452199660181854],[-118.65452641844615,37.452199660181854],[-118.65452641844615,37.45130033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:23.986Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:06.433Z"}
