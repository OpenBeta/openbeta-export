Locate a beautiful but mossy right-facing corner near the left edge of the face. Right of this corner are 3 left-leaning cracks. The route starts in the leftmost crack/corner, above a horizontal black dike.\n\nP1) Up the slabby corner with stemming & some liebacks. Gear belay at a nice stance on the left with a fixed stopper. 5.10 100'\n\nP2) Follow the crack until it ends, then cast off onto the featured and extremely runout face. Some really marginal & weighted knob tie-offs are possible between the horrific 1/4\" bolts, as well as a shallow 0.75 cam in a pocket. At the second bolt, one may be tempted to try going straight up - this is very hard - instead traverse hard right and then up a lower angle crack. An angle piton and a third bolt will reveal themselves. Climb up the chimney to a large belay ledge made of boulders. 5.8+ R 160'\n\nP3) Up the crack and chimney to the top. With anything less than a 70M rope, you will have to do 2 pitches to top out. 5.8 220'","protection":"Standard rack to 3\"","location":"Starts in the first left-leaning crack/corner to the right of the obvious mossy right-facing corner.
