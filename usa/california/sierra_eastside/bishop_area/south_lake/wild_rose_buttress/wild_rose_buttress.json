It is sustained and varied with excellent rock and movement. Extend some pieces to avoid rope drag.\n\nStart at a giant flake thing that is protruding from the wall. I climbed the right side of it, but it might also be possible to start on the left. Climb the crack through a series of bulges to reach the final arching splitter. This section has great position as the cliff drops away just a few feet below you. Don't get tunnel vision here and look around for other features besides the finger crack. Pull through one last bulge to the top.\n\nThe guidebook says it has a piton anchor. We found one piton which can be backed up by gear.
