The top eases up into low angle offwidth.\n\nTraverse in from the right and back clean your .75, other starts are possible but involve no gear on grainy rock.\n\nWalk off the back or scramble down a gulley to the right.\n\nStanding at the bottom the climb is steeper/more overhanging than it looks in the distance. I was spooked, but it's all there and the flake isn't going anywhere.","protection":"I placed a 0.75 to get to the bottom of the chimney, then a single set of cams #4-#6 and a big bro #3 and #4\n\nTo go lighter, leave the #3 big bro and #5 on the ground.","location":"It's very visible with many ways to access. Easiest is probably to walk to the south of the formation and scramble up a gulley (with 4th class or easy 5th) to get to the base, or climb something else. We walked to the south side of the formation and climbed a very grainy offwidth to gain access to the climb."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,28ecf9b8-3e02-54f1-9a23-26c5d4120483,58a4c1de-fc5b-5e0c-89ad-ab28ac59e4fe,0313761d-fabf-5c02-a400-7f4d45cfb3d4,30dbcc4f-210b-58db-b00f-e175d36a8ce7","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sierra Eastside","Bishop Area","Little Egypt","Dinosaur Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.52551,37.30149]},"bbox":[-118.52607528482862,37.30104033981813,-118.52494471517136,37.30193966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113948843","area_id":"MNvMTyELWNuwD+F102qM5w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:23.342Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:40:55.448Z"}
