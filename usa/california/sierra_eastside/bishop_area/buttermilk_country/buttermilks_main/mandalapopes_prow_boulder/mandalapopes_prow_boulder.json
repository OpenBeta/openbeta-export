Randy Puro) and checks in at V8.\n\nOriginally named for local hardman Mike Pope, although he claims he never climbed it.

In the fall of 2002, during the Petzl Roc Trip, Tony Lamiche grabbed the coveted first ascent of the sit down start (dubbed The Mandalion,) that checks in at V13/14, making it one of the harder testpieces in Bishop.","protection":"pads and spotters.","location":"The obvious prow on the North-west side of the boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"t3N0cs1xWdKbTdUGNOizng==","name":"Devoted Traverse","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.57492,37.32909]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"109903545","mp_crag_id":"105908150","climb_id":"t3N0cs1xWdKbTdUGNOizng==","areaRef":"hBNP6v+UWvinBiw2RLX9zQ=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start at two good opposing sidepulls.
