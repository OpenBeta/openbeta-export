In some way it seems easier than Saigon but maybe it's because I'm short. In any case, start as for Saigon. Instead of getting the left hand pinch/sidepull and heading right, move straight up from here via a couple of possible sequences to a high pinch/edge. This is where you start to feel the air beneath you a bit. Move right from this hold with difficulty and rejoin Saigon for the finish.","protection":"The ground is like cement here so several pads and a really good spotter are ideal. An uncontrolled fall from the crux pinch/edge could really hurt on this one.","location":"Start as for Saigon and move right from the high pinch hold. The Superdirect (harder, scarier) goes straight up from the pinch to slopers at the very top of the prow!
