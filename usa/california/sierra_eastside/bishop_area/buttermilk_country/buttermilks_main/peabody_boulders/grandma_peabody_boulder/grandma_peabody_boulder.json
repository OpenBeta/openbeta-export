You could say it's contrived, but only because it's possible to go straight up the jugs to the left from the start. Once you're on the problem, it's as independent a line as any. This one starts on jugs to the left of Center Direct and traverses right via the 'finishing jug' of that problem to a series of edges and crimps midway up the wall. The crux is just high enough to get one's attention and involves a technical heel hook and a committing lock-off from a small crimp. The next few moves leading to the patina jugs are easier but still require some power. Tiptoe carefully up the slab above; you'll be soloing at this point. There are a couple of options. It's probably easiest starting a little further left from the uppermost patina, but you can more or less go straight up from where you finish the problem as well. Either way is a bit bold, but there are just enough positive smears to make it reasonable though insecure. Amazing! You can also climb into this line via Center Direct or, if you're really pulling hard, Direction.","protection":"Pads and a good spotter. The landing zone is flat but hard as cement.
