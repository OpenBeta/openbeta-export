Make a few really fun and unique moves that takes you to a couple small sharp crimps. Now stare at the blank face and wonder what you do next?\n\nThe entry moves on this problem are really good and you climb into a very powerful or technical crux section. There are a couple invisible micro crimps that can be used. There is also a 1 finger pad spike. Going out right to a gaston is probably the way for shorter folks.
