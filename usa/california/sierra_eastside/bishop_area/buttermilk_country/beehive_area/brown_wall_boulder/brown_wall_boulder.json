Beautiful bulletproof quartz monzonite with small smooth holds in a majestic location!\n\nStand Start matched on a small right facing side pull and make a big move up left hand to a small crimp. From here make another long reach up with your other hand to a decent crimp rail. Position your feet and come in for the match! Then bust another move out right to another small crimp. Get a high left foot and do a big cross to a small flake.\n\nReach over with the right hand to a decent hold at the arete. Swap the left hand from a crimp to a side pull and gather all you have left in the gas tank. Make a big dynamic move up to the last hold. Crimp down hard on the left hand side pull in order to hold the swing! Match the diagnol lip and get up there! Finish up the slab(money) or walk righwards and drop down.\n\nThe Swarm Direct(v13) has also been done by Nalle in 2011.
