Start at a glassy slopey rail which has a few good spots on it. Make two hard pull to small edges and then make a dyno up to a big flat protrusion. Not as good as you want it to be and slightly chossy. Might be worth climbing up and brushing.\n\nA static approach is possible by doing an awkward press/ mantel and going left hand to a sloper then bumping up.\n\nOnce established on the sloper jug climb up via some more slopers and make a high step finishing maneuver to get on top.\n\nFrom the start it seems you could go up to the edges at right and make a few hard pulls to gain a good crimp edge.
