This is a fun romp up well protected face and cracks.\n\nP1, 5.9- Head up the left hand side of the low angle slab at the top of the approach. The route on the right hand side in the corner is Smoothberry. Three bolts on this pitch supplement adequate smaller gear placements. Two bolt anchor, or link into P2.\n\nP2, 4th class- Move leftwards. Really more of an anchor move over dirty terrain towards the opposing left and right facing corners capped by a big roof. Gear anchor.\n\nP3, 5.8- Climb between the two opposing corners, aiming for the left hand side of the roof. A weird series of large blocks and a \"chimney\" gets you through the overhang. Continue up the undercut face following a crack to the right. Belay on a big ledge. Gear anchor.\n\nP4, 5.8- Follow good cracks up and right on from the anchor onto the arete feature. Pass a few bushes, and belay at a good stance at a horizontal 2\" crack. Notice the bolt above you on the next pitch. There is no decent way to incorporate that into an anchor. Gear belay takes 1.75-2.5\" cams.\n\nP5, 5.10a- The crux pitch, but really a one move wonder. Head up towards the lone bolt. Clip it, then make a tenuous slab move on exfoliating potato chips. Carry on easier terrain following the natural ridge feature to a two bolt anchor and good stance at the terrace below the upper Elderberry Buttress. This pitch can probably be linked with P4 with a 70m rope.\n\nDescend from the P5 anchor, moving right from the route, and ultimately heading into the gully. A series of bolted anchors allow rappels with a 70m rope. With two 70's, you can easily link rappels, though it would still be best to do the first rap with a single rope.","protection":"Single rack to 3\". Doubles in the 1-2\" sizes (C4 # 0.5-2). Most of the anchors are gear anchors.","location":"Head right from the trail as you near the base of the PSOM slab, there is a secondary gully that takes you towards Scheelite/Elderberry/Dingleberry. Follow the trail up to the top. This is Dingleberry Buttress. There are several sport climbs on a clean buttress. Youngerberry starts on the left hand side of the corner on the slab."},"__v":0},{"_id":"idjGKrd9UA2tOjt1wMJLqw==","name":"Thin Ice","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Alan Bartlett, Bob Bartlett, 1/77 GU","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.6744,37.389]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"117930602","mp_crag_id":"106771523","climb_id":"idjGKrd9UA2tOjt1wMJLqw==","areaRef":"bYE26pDIX8O4OmS8P2WQfA=="},"content":{"description":"An adventurous 'old-school' style route with typical limited/difficult protection. This route doesn't see much traffic, so there is a lot of exfoliating granite and some lichen/moss on the upper pitches. That said, if you like the challenge of a route that will make you feel like you are on the FA, with cracks, mild O/W, slabby face and some exposure, this is one to go for.  One 70m or two ropes required for the descent.\n\nP1) 5.7. Climb the corner to a break in the roof, and move right through the roof.  The book calls for setting an anchor at that point, but up the crack 15-20' there are better anchor options. The crack at the very start of this pitch has a bush growing out of it, so we slogged a bit higher up the gulley and stepped onto a nice sloping ledge to start.\n\nP2) 5.8. Traverse right on the rust streak to another crack.  There are multiple cracks; we chose the one that appeared to be the second to the last.  Looking up this crack you can see a hand-traverse crack heading right at the top. The anchor is sketchy; the left bolt is a button head through an aluminum angle and the right is an old bolt of indeterminate size and age with a regular hanger. No rings; there were two carabiners with the gates taped shut, which we left in place. It appears you could bail right into the gulley at this point if desired.\n\nP3) 5.10A, 3 bolts.  Climb the face left and up from the anchor; you’ll see the first bolt about 15’ away. At the big ledge, walk to the right end and build an anchor.  Exfoliating granite makes the slabby moves a bit exciting; we had to clean the rock and our shoes for each move. This is a very short pitch and you only need three draws for protection; no other pro.\n\nP4) 5.9, 1 bolt. A bulgy start at the bolt continues with a difficult to protect pitch.  There may be multiple options for this pitch; we stayed to the right at the edge of the drop-off. Good anchor/stances about 20 meters up, but it appears you could combine this pitch with the next. Starting to get into some lichen and heavier exfoliation.\n\nP5) 5.7.  Interesting weathered flakes on this pitch.  More lichen. Easy top out.\n\nDescend via Joint Effort.  Scramble climbers left around the back side of the buttress, keeping an eye out for new rappel rings on the upper face.  Four 35m rappels.  Be sure to rappel pretty much straight down; if you go climbers left to the anchors above the roof on In Dubious Battle, you'll need two ropes to rappel from there.  Hike over to the anchors at the top of Youngerberry, and five more 35m rappels get you back to your packs.","protection":"Standard rack through 4\"","location":"The last left facing corner on the right edge of the Elderberry Buttress upper tier.  The best approach is via Youngberry.  Hike up PSOM to about Rattlesnake Errands then head up and right and over the toe of the Elderberry buttress (not below the toe - over it).  Follow a vague trail up until you can rock hop up the middle of the gulley to stay out of the loose sand.  You'll eventually hit a not-well-used switchback trail that ends at a nice platform at the base of Youngerberry. Climb Youngerberry, unrope and hike across the base of the upper tier and up the next gulley a bit."},"__v":0},{"_id":"HSyFaN/YWeqnkk+HLu8Gqg==","name":"Smoothberry","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"Tai and Mary Devore","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.6744,37.389]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"120506169","mp_crag_id":"106771523","climb_id":"HSyFaN/YWeqnkk+HLu8Gqg==","areaRef":"bYE26pDIX8O4OmS8P2WQfA=="},"content":{"description":"A surprisingly fun route on excellent smooth rock.  The bolts are not tightly spaced and while the climbing is relatively low key, it may feel insecure at times and strangely engaging for the grade.  As the upper part steepens, holds become a bit more positive.","protection":"7 bolts, hook anchor","location":"Start in the corner that is formed by Elderberry Buttress (left) and Dingleberry Buttress (right).  Follow the first line of bolts on the left side (Elderberry) smooth slab.  The route is just to the right of Youngerberry."},"__v":0},{"_id":"kL59s2sQUCWc7GBBgdN9sA==","name":"Regular Route","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Doug Robinson, Lester Robinson, 1970","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.6744,37.389]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"112793303","mp_crag_id":"106771523","climb_id":"kL59s2sQUCWc7GBBgdN9sA==","areaRef":"bYE26pDIX8O4OmS8P2WQfA=="},"content":{"description":"Five pitches of adventurous climbing.
