The route is mixed as far as protection (bolts and gear) as well as the climbing itself... mantles, friction, liebacking, hand and foot jamming and even steep jug hauling are all thrown in. From the base the route is rather intimidating but with closely spaced bolts the route is mostly safe. Unfortunately the crux of the route is trying to find and place sound gear while at the most strenuous, steep, and intimidating section of the route. After a fair amount of effort and a couple of questionable pieces I finally managed to get a piece I was willing to climb past. Above, placing gear continued to be awkward and strenuous and never seemed ideal but the last bolt is soon reached and then the anchor is just a few pulls and smears away.","protection":"9 bolts and Pro to 1\"    or scroll down for the long winded version of what I placed.\n\nAfter the 8th bolt I placed a .75 C4 that probably would have blown taking a nice jug with it. Then fiddled with a small cam where a stopper probably would have been much better(#7 or 8 BD stopper ???) but last minute removed them from my rack. Not liking the look of the cam I got, I managed a fairly good .3C4 with a lot of energy expenditure a little higher. After committing to the crux moves and stopping with the last piece at my feet I battled with finding another. After much effort finally managed an ok small blue Metolious and climbed through to the next bolt and then the anchor. So next time I bring a couple of stoppers  a .3C4 and a red C3 and leave the rest on the ground. You might choose to bring the .75 incase you gas out you can rest on it. Also you could get a micro stopper below the red C3 but probably just gun it for the last bolt.","location":"The route is located in the middle of the Wall just left of an easier looking crack, Triple Jeopordy."},"__v":0},{"_id":"Ysvq6DWdXWaHO+RAna+wVw==","name":"My dirty secret","yds":"5.10c/d","grades":{"yds":"5.10c/d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Devores","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.67647,37.38297]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"108915908","mp_crag_id":"108915158","climb_id":"Ysvq6DWdXWaHO+RAna+wVw==","areaRef":"DB7HzfMhUYKdn053r7umFg=="},"content":{"description":"Awesome varied crack climb but with often less than stellar rock. In other words, do this route but make sure you do it with an attentive, loose rock savvey partner and wear your helmets, especially the belayer. The route is not called Dirty Secret for nothing but it is great climbing none the less. It's a giant left facing corner that goes on and on. Can be done in one or two pitches. Would be great to see this thing get more traffic and maybe a little cleaning up.  The hardest moves for me were at the second bolt right before the first anchor getting to the ledge where the crack in the corner kinda seams out. Above the first anchor a ways there is a blank seeming section  with tricky pro but the holds are incut and it turns out to be not so bad.
