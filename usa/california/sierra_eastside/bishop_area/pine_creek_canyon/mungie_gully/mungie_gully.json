Locate a small dirt road below the gate and follow it along the power lines, across a swamp, and up onto the flat tailings piles across to the delta wall. Walk past the boulder and slightly down along a dirt road which crosses underneath the talus gullies. When you arrive below a large triangular buttress with obvious cracks, walk up to and around the right side and into the Mungie Gully.
