The original line he had envisioned would have climbed the first half of Rubus Cube into the top of Nadine - while this proved unclimbable, once we messed around for a while we realized that there were two awesome independent lines there.\n\nThe grade reflects the fact that neither Luke nor I had previously climbed anything harder than 13b, and both agree that this rig is harder than anything else we've climbed.
