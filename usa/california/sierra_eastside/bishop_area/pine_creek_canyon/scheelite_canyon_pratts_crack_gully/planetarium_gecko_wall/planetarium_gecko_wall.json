The climbing is pretty thuggy, but there is just enough technical climbing to keep you focussing on your footwork as well.  You will not be disappointed when you rope up for this one.\n\nVenture left at bolt 5 to the neighboring anchors to climb the variation known as Atomic Rage (12d).","protection":"7 bolts + anchors","location":"This is the 4th route from the left edge of the wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"35w5bSdLW1yjFLnsK2YWwQ==","name":"Aristotle","yds":"5.12b","grades":{"yds":"5.12b","french":"7b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.67785,37.38453]},"left_right_index":16,"mp_id":"115395872","mp_crag_id":"105912888","climb_id":"35w5bSdLW1yjFLnsK2YWwQ==","areaRef":"PC9aY4U2Xr27ScbHzkzyqQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start on Biohazard 12a.
