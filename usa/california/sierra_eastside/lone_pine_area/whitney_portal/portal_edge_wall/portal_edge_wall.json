Instead of belaying on road, scramble up kitty litter to the big tree. Climb the arete/thin cracks/slab up and left past bolts and pins to join Portaledge. At the top of the second pitch, instead of climbing up the left-leaning crack, face climb up and right past 3 bolts (5.8). Two bolted anchors allow rap with one 60m down right to the start tree.\n\n(Text copied verbatim from Greg Barnes' description on rc.com.)","protection":"thin to 5\"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,28ecf9b8-3e02-54f1-9a23-26c5d4120483,95d927bb-d322-5477-8302-0f3059a7825c,3b208dbd-11de-5685-9a21-3f12dd045fab,93fe6b6a-23e4-538f-b4dd-bb24c6740e8e","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sierra Eastside","Lone Pine Area","Whitney Portal","Portal Edge Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.2159,36.595]},"bbox":[-118.21646006633759,36.59455033981815,-118.21533993366245,36.59544966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105897793","area_id":"k/5raiPkU4+03bskxnQOjg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:37.601Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:40:01.529Z"}
