Build a gear belay.\n\nPitch 2:  climb up and over to crack, place pro, then step over the corner to the right onto the face loaded with big chickenheads.  Sling knobs, and, dance on up.  Can traverse to the right and back left on a line of knobs to keep the grade a bit lower.  In 60 or more feet, clip a bolt.  Climb up and trend left to the shallow and steeper ridge crest and pass the steeper section by slinging another knob.  Step up, look up and to the right above a low angle crescent cut out, and clip the last bolt.  Milk lower angle friction weaknesses to the top of the slab.  Find anchor towards the steeper wall just above the rappel back into the gully behind the wall (sling in pinch).\n\nDescent:  single rope rappel back into the gully.  Follow gully down, take a left and either do a kinda sketchy downclimb on the climber's right of the gully, or, rappel from one of the large pine trees to gain the base of the route.\n\nNote:  we didn't notice the \"tunnel\" mentioned in the guidebook and other route descriptions.  Wondering if recent rockfall has buried it...?","protection":"Standard rack (set of stoppers and cams to 3 camalot or equivalent).  2 lead bolts on the second pitch.  Take slings for knobs.  No fixed anchor on route.
