At the bolt make a difficult (10c) traverse left, across the slab, to reach the left end of the flake. This is an easy offwidth which leads to a stance below the corner. Make some committing 5.7 moves across a slab to reach the corner. The corner is 10b and awkward. When the corner ends, traverse left past a bolt and then up to a 2 bolt anchor.\n\nThis first pitch is very difficult to climb without lots of rope drag. Twin ropes would be useful.\n\nA variation exists that bypasses the 10c crux. At the first bolt head up and right on some scary looking 5.9 slab. You can also climb on the outside of the 10b corner up juggy knobs. This route is called Blackballed (5.9) and links back up with Corner Pocket at the end of the second pitch.\n\nPitch 2: From the belay climb up to a bolt and then traverse hard right (10a) to another bolt. Then up to the top of the cliff.\n\nWalk right to a 3rd class gully to descend. Alternatively, rap to the ground with 2 ropes from a bolted anchor near the edge of the cliff (at the top of Blue Balls).","protection":"Pro to 3\"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"92/LHidVW4+C/DQodd+87g==","name":"Blue Balls","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Steve Plunkett, Errett Allen (Dec, '86)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.24075,36.58651]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"107262030","mp_crag_id":"105895635","climb_id":"92/LHidVW4+C/DQodd+87g==","areaRef":"VbvqVuUhVPKZaA9lz/bB3g=="},"content":{"description":"This route is to the right of Corner Pocket.
