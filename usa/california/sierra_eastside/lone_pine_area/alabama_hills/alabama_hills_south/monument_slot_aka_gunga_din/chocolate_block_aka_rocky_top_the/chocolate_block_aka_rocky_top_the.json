Not to get all hype-y, but this route is pretty damned funcomplete with a 40 chimney to big stems, a bomb bay squeeze, thin face section to a bulge crux a la High Plains Drifter and then finishes on those crazy fun plates we all know and love. Its a long route with excellent position and exposure combining for a nice mental and physical workout at the grade. [Note: the rock around the 8th & 9th bolts at the bulge area is still a bit crumbly, but should clean up---and the key holds should stay put---so that will add a bit to the head game, but pulling through feels quite excellent.

I only mention that to say that if youre itching to climb in the Hills during the off season, this route starts in a perennially cool and dark corridor chimney (and the entire northeast-facing wall goes into the shade around 2:30 in high summer). Not many people seem to venture south of the Portal Road, but if youre getting tired of the Shark Fin hero shots and the Tall Wall selfies, get over to the Gunga Din areaand the Chocolate Block especially.\n\n(Urban Dictionary defines chocolate pocket two ways.
