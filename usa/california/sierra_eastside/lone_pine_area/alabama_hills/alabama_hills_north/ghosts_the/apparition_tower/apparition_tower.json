Clip a bolt and cast off up the tower with closely spaced bolts all the way.\n\nThe crux is a bulge above the 5th or 6th bolt.\n\nA fun and very well protected route with nice exposure. Mussy hooks at the anchor.\n\nThe bolts are a bit closer than most typical Hills routes and the rock is good (all patina plates).","protection":"8? bolts","location":"Behind Elephant Rock and Leaning Tower of Pizza"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,28ecf9b8-3e02-54f1-9a23-26c5d4120483,95d927bb-d322-5477-8302-0f3059a7825c,a6b1ce37-194d-5d3a-9e7a-04151d2c7508,a3ab1d26-6f38-5577-be50-aa16ab198a23,7bef4740-f19b-557f-97e3-09d2dbf7d6d4,65803905-1fab-519b-986d-71e9d7575f18","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sierra Eastside","Lone Pine Area","Alabama Hills","Alabama Hills North","Ghosts, The","Apparition Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.13038,36.60613]},"bbox":[-118.13094014714392,36.605680339818136,-118.12981985285604,36.60657966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119949157","area_id":"ZYA5BR+rUZuYbXHp11dfGA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:43.085Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:12:37.900Z"}
