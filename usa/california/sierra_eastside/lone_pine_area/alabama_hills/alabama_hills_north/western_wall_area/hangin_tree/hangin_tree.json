Follow the bolt line through a thin layback crack with a finger jam or two up to an obvious roof. The crux is from the 3rd bolt to the 5th bolt through powerful moves over the mini roof on holds way worse than they look from the ground. After your over the roof the climb eases up. The anchor is only 2 hangers and webbing that is past being usable  so we left 1 beiner on one of the hangers. I will go back up there soon to install some mussys but be prepared to leave a beiner or quick link until then.\n\nIf anyone has info on the FA party or the name I’ll update it immediately.","protection":"A 2” piece to protect the initial crack moves and 7-8 draws for the upper part of the route.","location":"Located on opposite side of the corridor from Flappy and RCM."},"__v":0},{"_id":"9ZwGQR6GVAyatDbllmlP9Q==","name":"RCM (Redneck Cracker Motherf*ckers)","yds":"5.10b","grades":{"yds":"5.10b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Erik Anderson, Crystal Anderson, 11/2004","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.13224,36.60642]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106467289","mp_crag_id":"106467286","climb_id":"9ZwGQR6GVAyatDbllmlP9Q==","areaRef":"NWF/nqZPW0+rYZAkXrwlnQ=="},"content":{"description":"Since the route begins in a narrow corridor, it is possible to stem the start, then move out on the face after the second bolt or so.
