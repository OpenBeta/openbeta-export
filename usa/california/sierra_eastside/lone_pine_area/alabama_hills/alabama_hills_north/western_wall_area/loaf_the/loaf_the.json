Protection with med/large cams under roof available.  After surmounting the small roof the games begin.  Only experienced climbers with their lid screwed on tight should attempt this lead.  The ability to stop and tie off knobs and equalize marginal gear behind flakes a plus.  One bolt located about half-way up the route.  You'll see a similar bolt only 5' away for the neighboring route \"Bad Bananas\".  Clip the bolt, chose your path and travel towards the arete to gain the summit.  The original route follows just right of the arete then sweeps right to top anchors (Mussy Hooks) at 42m!  Be mindful of the length of this crag as two ropes or shenanigans are required for descent.\n\nOptional anchor located about 20' below and left (towards the arete) of the original line which will work for a sling-shot system using a 70m rope.  This sub-anchor is likely the primary for the mystery 4 bolt route under the arete.  Works fine if you'd prefer to belay from the ground and don't mind missing the last 20' of this classic line.","protection":"One Bolt plus (2) 2-3\" cams, set of wires, a few small cams (wishful thinking), many long slings.","location":"The Loaf Arete is located on the far left side of the north/west face of The Loaf.

Unlike 'The Pangborn', AHG starts off with sustained thin slab work before reaching the nice patina plates that the rest of The Loaf is known for. So, lace them shoes up tight! Although the route is well protected (17 bolts, 160'), the page author personally feels that this route is one of the hardest routes on the wall.\n\nOK, with that said, step off the flat boulder and onto the slab. Beware....there's a good sized gap between the slab and the boulder. A spotter would be wise to use before clipping the first bolt! After clipping the first bolt, continue up to the next two bolts taking advantage of the small foot divots and dime edges along the way. After passing the 3rd bolt, work your way up left then back right (5.10a) before clipping the 4th bolt. Pass 2 more bolts before reaching the left leaning ramp. Gain the ramp and head up right to gain a stance to clip bolt #7. Once there, step out left onto the face and enjoy the rest of the climb by working up good edges and incuts on patina plates. Pass 8 more bolts before coming to the 'physical' crux (5.9), by overcoming a subtle bulge near the top of the climb. Pass 2 more bolts and you're home free to one of the best view in the 'Bamas'! Rappel the route using TWO ropes (two bolt anchor with rings).","protection":"- (2) 60m ropes\n\n- (17) quickdraws\n\n- Fried green tomatoes (optional)","location":"Take Movie Road and head north for 2.5 miles before reaching a right turn in the road.
