The climb starts with technical pockets and edges up to a big pocket jug. From here a quick layback up the arete leads to a double sided flake/rest. The clip after the rest is very difficult (esp. for short people) and there is velcro for setting up a \"reachable\" long draw. The next section is the bouldery crux moving out left to gain a large hueco. Steep jugs lead from here. Great bouldery route other than the hard clip.","protection":"6 quickdraws to anchors","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"mei8DGHZXBCY79lfHVFpRw==","name":"Porridge","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.91432,37.78932]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"114156885","mp_crag_id":"105843241","climb_id":"mei8DGHZXBCY79lfHVFpRw==","areaRef":"IvseDxcdWHuKFxtlgwWMxw=="},"content":{"description":"The first half of this route is slab/face, the second half follows the large left facing dihedral to anchors near the top of the formation.","protection":"7 bolts to anchors; lower off.","location":"About 15' to the left of Maltese Falcon."},"__v":0},{"_id":"QsSXA1MjVH+5J2RQ6dTlgQ==","name":"Maltese Falcon","yds":"5.12a","grades":{"yds":"5.12a","french":"7a+"},"fa":"Dan McDevitt, 1990","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.91432,37.78932]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105843244","mp_crag_id":"105843241","climb_id":"QsSXA1MjVH+5J2RQ6dTlgQ==","areaRef":"IvseDxcdWHuKFxtlgwWMxw=="},"content":{"description":"A long chossy slab leads up to the first bolt.
