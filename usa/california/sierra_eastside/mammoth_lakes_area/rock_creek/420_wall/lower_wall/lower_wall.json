Unfortunately, you can't see much of that from the ground, or you would probably reconsider climbing the route.\n\nThe beta in the book is not good overall.  The effort to descend is not worth the quality of the climbing, in my opinion.  You can use a set of rap anchors for the final rappel to the climber's right of the large first pitch corner.\n\nI edited this description to help with the FA Team's ego.  I was a little more critical the first time around.","protection":"If you don't want to run it out a bit, bring doubles in the BD larger sizes (not the #5).","location":"Far left of 4:20 wall.
