Tag this spire and move to the next one.  Repeat this pattern until a summit register is reached at the 5714' Aquila Peak.\n\nThere appear to be more than five summits on this route.

All the summits can be soloed from one side or another. If the going gets tough, try another aspect.","location":"A true traverse of the fingers would be quite hard and probably hasn't been done.
