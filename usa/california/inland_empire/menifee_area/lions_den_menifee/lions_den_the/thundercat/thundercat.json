Climb upward to nice crimp and finish with a big move and commit to the sketchy slab top out.\n\nStart is difficult for shorter people and the last committing move is the crux. Stacking pads will make the starting move much much easier.\n\nCan be top roped. A bolt was added at the top. Can use the bolt and boulder at the top to build an anchor.\n\n*Anchor is one bolt and small boulder. Use static rope for Top R. And don't just use one bolt.*\n\n^Thanks Gavin Bridgman.","protection":"Pads and spotter","location":"The northern most portion of the east face of the large boulder just down hill of the Lion's Mane.\n\n33.676075, -117.117313"},"__v":0},{"_id":"b7Cnkm4AWsqDImB0G1GHnw==","name":"Pussy Foot traverse","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"Skyler Irish","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.11732,33.67608]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"112532540","mp_crag_id":"112457398","climb_id":"b7Cnkm4AWsqDImB0G1GHnw==","areaRef":"yA9P/+b9WgSIPghpGJ5XsA=="},"content":{"description":"Begin just around the right arete  on side pull and pinch.
