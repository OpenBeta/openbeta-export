Move left.  Stay about 1 to 4 feet off the ground. Towards the right, it will get more difficult and come up over some smaller boulders, towards the start of the Charred Shrub route. Follow it, you won't need to worry about being over those small boulders for this because you should stay less than a foot and a half above them.  If you fall on them you won't fall backwards, they form a little protective ledge.  The crux is towards the end, it becomes challenging slab climbing. It starts easy and get's harder so it's ideal for new climbers if you want to hop on and see how far you can get.","protection":"Low traverse.
