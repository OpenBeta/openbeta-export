Nevertheless, it is still possible for those who enjoy cranking on finger-wrenching crimps and using precise footwork. Both powerful and delicate, putting this problem on your Rubidoux circuit will help keep you primed and ready for those sick, improbable stopper moves you're likely to encounter out at Joshua Tree or Suicide. Once past the hard moves, it is possible to escape left (and down) or right and up the \"In the Picture\" finish.\n\nSo, where are the \"new school\" testpieces, one might ask? The answer is there really aren't any. Nevertheless, despite Rubidoux's hardest problems getting sent decades ago and receiving vague old-school bouldering grades (5.12+/B1+/etc.), some of these problems (\n\nPink Bug\n\n, The Octopus, Flabob, to name a few) are probably among the most difficult of their kind anywhere, and they are very rarely done. Some have likely never been repeated.\n\nFor some interesting discussion of Rubidoux's hardest by actual old school Stonemasters, see the following link:\n\nsupertopo.com/climbing/threâ€¦\n\nWhere are today's dime cranking masters?","protection":"crash pads","location":"Fifteen feet left of Five Niner.
