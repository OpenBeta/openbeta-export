Begin on the right side of the tallest face of the boulder. A tricky deadpoint or dyno gains the \"linear fracture\" (i.e., shallow horizontal crack) which is traversed left and slightly upwards to jugs. It is also possible to traverse halfway across the fracture and go straight up (probably the same difficulty). For shorter people, or for people who simply can't make the initial dyno move, it is possible to start this problem from the toppled block on the right. A cool non-slab problem requiring some body tension and careful sequencing and footwork.","protection":"crash pads","location":"On the tallest boulder that is about 75 feet or so to the northeast from the main wall of the Island."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,4607a1af-cccd-5c7a-910b-a7f0c81a794a,d1b5ac19-7ebe-5d62-8892-ff7f1b35564d,83c13c69-19c3-55b6-9b4d-a3dcd5fa717f,91493901-1a1c-51ca-823f-0e17c1daf4f9,aa66d9e9-d373-54bd-b76e-5a42872b8ef0","pathTokens":["USA","California","Inland Empire","Riverside Area","Mount Rubidoux","Island Area","Hueco Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"V2-3"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.3938,33.982]},"bbox":[-117.39434227329944,33.98155033981814,-117.39325772670055,33.982449660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107440104","area_id":"qmbZ6dNzVL23blpChyuO8A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-117.39434227329944,33.98155033981814],[-117.39325772670055,33.98155033981814],[-117.39325772670055,33.982449660181864],[-117.39434227329944,33.982449660181864],[-117.39434227329944,33.98155033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:49.320Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:58:35.993Z"}
