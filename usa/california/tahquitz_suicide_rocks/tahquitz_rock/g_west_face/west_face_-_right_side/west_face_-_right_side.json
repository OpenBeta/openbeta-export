Just above the treetop there is a spot where you can exit the lieback and climb right onto the top of the dihedral (hard 5.10 move).  Once on the face, clip a bolt (buttonhead, but looked good).  Climb up the right side arete for a bit of easier 5.10 climbing for about 20' to the next bolt.  Clip this and welcome to the crux.  Intricate slab (2 moves) gaines a good crack.  Finishes at a 2 bolt rap station (good bolts)\n\nP4-5: Follow El Camino Real, Jensen's Jaunt, or Pigs in Bondage to the top\n\nA great way to TR the sweet P3 is to do El Camino Real and climb up and right from the El Camino P3 anchors (easy 5th) 20' and gain this 2 bolt station and TR the route.","protection":"Several thin to 2 inches","location":"Starts as per El Camino Real near the No Top Pine Tree on the bouldery 5.10a start just left of an incipient crack to an overlap.\n\nRight of Fingertip Traverse and left of Jensen's Jaunt.\n\nWalkoff Friction Traverse."},"__v":0},{"_id":"PcRPQvKTWg68oKnt2PKuVg==","name":"Crimes of Passion","yds":"5.11-","grades":{"yds":"5.11-","french":"6c"},"fa":"Bob Gaines Charlie Peterson August 1987, Direct Start Gob Gaines and Charlie Peterson August 1997","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.68542,33.75985]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"106550478","mp_crag_id":"106181534","climb_id":"PcRPQvKTWg68oKnt2PKuVg==","areaRef":"lOn4ElYkVqqeJWpDtJBfQA=="},"content":{"description":"Crimes of Passion climbs parallel to Fingertrip, crosses at the second pitch arch and continues until the eponymous Fingertrip Traverse.\n\nPitch 1:\n\nOriginal Start: Startup Fingertrip, but traverse left after about 40 feet.\n\nDirect Start:  Start as for The Slab, up and right of the start of Fingertrip.

Pull the mantle, and attempt to avoid \"beached whale syndrome\".  Do the same to the next easier mantle (with a bolt) to join the original start.\n\nThe climbing through the next three bolts is for the most part continuous 5.10 climbing, not always with the comfort of a quickdraw in front of your face.
