Clip the first bolt on the ladder, then face climb out right and up (5.11 PG/R) to a bolt (shared with The Crucifix). Climb up to another bolt, then traverse left and move up (5.11c) to a hanging belay at a 2-bolt anchor.\n\nTenuous (5.11-) friction diagonally up and left up a ramp past 2 bolts (the first bolt is shared with Field of Dreams which climbs straight up from the first bolt) takes you to a left-facing flake (on the Vampire route). Climb about 15 feet up the corner, then bust out right, face climbing up and right for about 30 feet up to a belay stance at a tiny ledge.\n\nThe last pitch climbs directly up the slab and intersects Upper Royal's Arch where it climbs over the giant arch at a flake (5.8), then finishes up a steep corner through the headwall (5.7).\n\nFirst Ascent History\n\nFA to top of bolt ladder: (5.7, A2) Don Wilson, Jerry Galwas, and Chuck Wilts, 1960 (they pendulumed right off the headwall from the top of the bolt ladder)\n\nFFA of dihedral to bolt ladder: Tobin Sorenson, 1973\n\nFFA of bolt ladder (on Toprope, 5.12a): Matt Bebe and Ian Katz, July 2000.","protection":"Double rack from thin to 2.5 inches, plus one 3-inch CD (#3 camalot)","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,08e49e2f-9145-54f6-823f-36ad193735af,2498cbb4-36bc-5cae-af3f-7a09ff60b422,550db05d-b53c-5854-95b5-c8077740ba4a,24087776-d2f3-5535-8106-1493f4d0d6f5","pathTokens":["USA","California","Tahquitz & Suicide Rocks","Tahquitz Rock","(f) West Face Bulge Routes","Upper Bulge Routes"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":3,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":3,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":16,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":3,"advanced":12,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":3,"advanced":12,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.6846,33.76015]},"bbox":[-116.68514086573241,33.75970033981813,-116.68405913426764,33.76059966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106181515","area_id":"JAh3dtLzVTWBBhST9NDW9Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.68514086573241,33.75970033981813],[-116.68405913426764,33.75970033981813],[-116.68405913426764,33.76059966018186],[-116.68514086573241,33.76059966018186],[-116.68514086573241,33.75970033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":16,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:23.341Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:27.676Z"}
