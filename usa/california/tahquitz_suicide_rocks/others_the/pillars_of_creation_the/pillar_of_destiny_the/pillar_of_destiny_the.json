After multiple sessions on the route and having to place 8 protection bolts on lead. The finished product is that of a completely different and unique climbing experience, ascending features in such a way that it is extremely different then almost anything found on all of San- J.\n\nFollow the super wild white swirling dike the entire way from start to finish up the narrow black buttress. Almost entirely face climbing with enter-mitten gear. This is with the exception of the first 15 feet being a brilliant straight in 5.7 hand crack. Finishing the last pitch on a super stellar, steep, crystalline hand crack in a corner for the last 25', with a surprise ending to an amazing summit!","protection":"Standard trad rack.","location":"Start at the toe of this narrow buttress and follow until its end.
