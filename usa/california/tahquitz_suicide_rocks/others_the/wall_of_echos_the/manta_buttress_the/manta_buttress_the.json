Coined for the Manta Buttress's location on \"The Wall of Echoes\". As of this posting, it may be the longest route on this formation. The rock quality is incredible, but as always in this area be mindful of rock fall. The first three pitches are 180'-200' each...Rope drag can be an issue if protection isn't sufficiently extended. Pitch 1 : Follow the crack system up as it trends slightly right until they diminish. Traverse left across a face and mantle the first belay ledge.\n\nPitch 2: Start right from the ledge and continue slightly left to a weakness that goes under a roof ledge. Pull the right side of the roof to another comfortable belay ledge.\n\nPitch 3: Continue up through the weakness to some easy climbing. Belay at the base of the summit block below a huge tree.\n\nPitch 4: Easy climbing to a worthwhile summit view!","protection":"Standard rack with doubles in hand size pieces.","location":"Follow directions to the Wall of Echoes. Look for the Giant Buttress/Tower system past Medicine Man as you wonder your way up along the base of the WOE. To descend, traverse right to the top of \"Rain Shadow\" to a series of single rope rappels on fixed anchors. Use a 60 meter rope or longer."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,08e49e2f-9145-54f6-823f-36ad193735af,e356f18a-61b9-570d-b6b1-c55e1a2afde4,d1536a34-d1f3-5396-adbe-2ddd93e6fb46,09f94dee-018b-5205-9e00-91d66674de26","pathTokens":["USA","California","Tahquitz & Suicide Rocks","Others, The","Wall of Echos, The","Manta Buttress, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.67999,33.75805]},"bbox":[-116.68053085248216,33.75760033981813,-116.67944914751786,33.75849966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111948730","area_id":"CflN7gGLUgWeAJHWZnTeJg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:54.017Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:51.297Z"}
