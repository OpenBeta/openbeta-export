The first pitch is great fun- the second pitch has some mandatory 5.7 R climbing, plus a punishing 10a offwidth.\n\nPitch 1: Lieback a flake (5.8) that slants up and left, then climb an interesting face past 5 bolts (10a above the last bolt) to the ledge and 2-bolt anchor shared with The Beast (130 feet).\n\nPitch 2: Climb a 5.9 crack that arches right (or the easier face further right), then lieback an unprotected corner (5.7 R) that leads to an awkward offwidth crack (5.10a). Belay at the base of the summit block.\n\nPitch 3: Climb the right side (west side) of the block, up an easy, juggy face, to a belay at a notch.\n\nA short scramble leads to the summit where there's a 2-bolt anchor.\n\nDescent: Scrable down the west side (toward Tahquitz Rock) to find the rappel bolts.
