The crux is the sequence of moves passing the second bolt on its left, and involves moves on super slick quartz crystals. Above the last bolt wander up the increasingly easy face to the summit.\n\nThe second clip is thin, a quick clip setup with a runner might be a good idea in order to stay off the ground. The second bolt could have been placed a few moves lower but then it wouldn't have adequately protected the next section given the proximity of the ground. Given the need for the bolt to be where it is, the placing of the bolt was quite entertaining on the FA, with falls being taken to get it in (good job by KP).","protection":"Four bolts.","location":"The rightmost route on the face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,08e49e2f-9145-54f6-823f-36ad193735af,63c7f572-dc8b-5fa8-ad18-7b6040a419ce,3575ae2a-6aff-5b57-b84b-43f4f040e012","pathTokens":["USA","California","Tahquitz & Suicide Rocks","Suicide Rock","(g) Obsession Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.696,33.771]},"bbox":[-116.6965409342137,33.77055033981814,-116.69545906578632,33.77144966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106244556","area_id":"NXWuKmr/W1e4S0P08EDgEg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-116.6965409342137,33.77055033981814],[-116.69545906578632,33.77055033981814],[-116.69545906578632,33.77144966018187],[-116.6965409342137,33.77144966018187],[-116.6965409342137,33.77055033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:19.465Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:59.869Z"}
