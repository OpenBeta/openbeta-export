In a shallow corner just to the left of Spring Cleaning you can place a finger size TCU to protect the climbing to the first bolt.  Climbing directly from the ground to the first bolt adds some additional cranking moves but doesn’t effect the overall difficulty of the climb, in my opinion"},"__v":0},{"_id":"4yWhrr7zXzuF7QqymXB6LA==","name":"10b or not 10b","yds":"5.10b","grades":{"yds":"5.10b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Troy Mayr and Charles Cole, July, 1987","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-116.69613,33.76941]},"left_right_index":18,"mp_id":"105792730","mp_crag_id":"105792257","climb_id":"4yWhrr7zXzuF7QqymXB6LA==","areaRef":"k7EfdR9RWsOjVgWu46iAqQ=="},"content":{"description":"This is a sustained thin face route.
