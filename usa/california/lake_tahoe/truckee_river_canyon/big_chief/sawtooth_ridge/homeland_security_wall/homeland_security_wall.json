The first bolt protects the intitial sequence, which is about 5.10a, and very fun.\n\nRun out about 20 feet to a large flake system where gear is optional. Matle the flake in a fun 5.8 move, and clip your final easy bolting stance. Exit Strategy diverges from Pre-Emptive Strike here by moving onto the left section of the bolts. 4 really rough bolts later through excellent gently overhung micro pinch face climbing, once final reachy move awaits, which moves from shit holds to a huge jug on the arete that seems just out of reach. clip the last bolt, mantle on nothing, and lower off.","protection":"7 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor.
