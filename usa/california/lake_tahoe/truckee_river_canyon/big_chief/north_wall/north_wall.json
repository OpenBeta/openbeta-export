It is .10a up to perhaps the second bolt.  I \"warmed up\" on this route, and was a little more than warm by the time I got to the top.\n\nThe route heads up over three bulges to the top anchors, first gently moving to the right via a scary traverse move, and the back to the left at the top.\n\nThe climb looks and feels at lot like the route just to the left (High Tide) except for slightly easier.  Climbing up to the last move is probably lower .11ish, until a very HARD last move sends you up to the top anchors.\n\nAt the top, this route and High Tide are pretty crowded.","protection":"6 bolts to a 2 bolt top anchor, which is shared with  High Tide (5.11c).","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"VzRMKycmW1CFvmP26RoAUA==","name":"High Tide","yds":"5.11c","grades":{"yds":"5.11c","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Joe Missick, 1994","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.2028,39.24665]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"105736037","mp_crag_id":"105734453","climb_id":"VzRMKycmW1CFvmP26RoAUA==","areaRef":"F6U5Af+ZVNWabapU3jgJAg=="},"content":{"description":"Located just left of Laas Rocket on the left-most part of the North Wall, High Tide is steep and sporty and unlike Laas Rocket, it actually has some positive holds.
