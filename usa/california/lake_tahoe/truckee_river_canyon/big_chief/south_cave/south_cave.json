This is the crux.  From there, climbing eases for 20 feet before you follow an overhung crack up and right to the anchors.  The top part is very pumpy.\n\nThere is also an 11c variation that ascends the VERY overhung left side of the wall and meets the main route after the third bolt.  I found clipping the third bolt to be quite difficult as did Aron.
