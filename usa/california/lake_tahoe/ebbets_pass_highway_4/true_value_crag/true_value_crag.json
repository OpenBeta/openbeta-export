It's a climb to be done only when it's real quiet at the crag though. Embarking on this journey with someone else climbing what you're about to cross is a bad move - so be smart.\n\n-What's good about it?:\n\nIt's long, fun, adventurous, and challenging with loads of good handholds, great friction, and it's mostly protectable with bolts.\n\n-What's bad about it?:\n\nStill a little dirty with some suspect flakes and lichen, feet can be tricky in spots, requires some gear placements to be safer, big pendulum fall potential for leader and follower in places, rope drag, and it's only climbable when no one else is climbing in the area.\n\nAlthough it's 95% bolt protected you'll want to bring along some cams and slings.\n\nRight after leaving the third bolt on \"The Pumpkin\", as the actual traversing begins, the feet get tiny and the hand holds can be tricky on the bulge for about 15 feet. Place a piece as soon as you can and place it well. A second bulge comes after passing \"I think the Devil Just Called My Name\", and is a little heads up. Some of the rock is suspect in places so use really good judgment to eliminate the risk of blowing a piece if you or the follower fall.\n\nDON'T place any cams behind flakes - only in solid rock\n\n. Check holds before yarding on them.","protection":"60 or 70 meter rope, cams .3-2\", 5-8 alpine draws (for bolts above traverse and extending cams), 8 quickdraws, rappel style belay devices for leader and follower. Bolted anchor.\n\nMAKE SURE TO KEEP THE FOLLOWER IN MIND WHEN PLACING PROTECTION\n\n- especially right after leaving the third bolt on the \"Pumpkin\" - where the traverse begins. It's a long way to the next bolt and that means a long ugly pendulum fall. Place gear as soon as you can and place it well.","location":"Route starts on \"The Pumpkin\". Climb straight up for three bolts through orange lichen and traverse climbers right into the obvious horizontal crack/flake system all the way to \"Swallowed\".\n\nBelay follower from the anchors on \"Swallowed\" and rappel from there when finished. Alternately, you can choose to belay from any of the anchors on the climbs you pass en-route if they are close to the line (ex. \"Izzy-b\"). This will minimize rope drag and could break the climb into two pitches."},"__v":0},{"_id":"FlMhnHQ5VY+6UaNnzxQY7w==","name":"Swallowed","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"Kenny Thompson  2010","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.72262,38.63789]},"left_right_index":18,"mp_id":"106767241","mp_crag_id":"106764604","climb_id":"FlMhnHQ5VY+6UaNnzxQY7w==","areaRef":"YaaLLiahUnq397uJn5r4Gw=="},"content":{"description":"hardest move at third bolt. then well protected climbing to anchors","protection":"bolts","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"J1iXY6cLVeC+UqOPIRDUIQ==","name":"Static Cling","yds":"5.12a","grades":{"yds":"5.12a","french":"7a+"},"fa":"Kenny Thompson, 1995","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.72262,38.63789]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"106764613","mp_crag_id":"106764604","climb_id":"J1iXY6cLVeC+UqOPIRDUIQ==","areaRef":"YaaLLiahUnq397uJn5r4Gw=="},"content":{"description":"a powerful move at the second bolt gets things started from there follow the seam to the crux at the sixth bolt.after clipping the last bolt go left onto the face good holds lead to anchor.","protection":"9 bolts open cold shuts","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"NWmldsK1Xu6VEIMFCJ1JVw==","name":"Spark Arrestor","yds":"5.10a/b","grades":{"yds":"5.10a/b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Kenny Thompson / Spark Flagg  2010","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.72262,38.63789]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"106884634","mp_crag_id":"106764604","climb_id":"NWmldsK1Xu6VEIMFCJ1JVw==","areaRef":"YaaLLiahUnq397uJn5r4Gw=="},"content":{"description":"A fun little route with no distinctive crux.
