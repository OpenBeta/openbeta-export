It's a pretty easy 5.7 and one of the four 5.7's in the area with only three of them worth climbing.  Fortunately, this is one of the three.  The climb is on the next spire to the left of \"Mixed Emotions\".  It will be easy to spot if you look for the bolts to the left of a ledgy crack.  There are four bolts with chains at the top but you'll only be able to see three of the four and the chains are just out of sight even though this is a short climb.  The roof would be the crux, but it's a small roof.  It's a good option if you're working in the 5.7 range.
