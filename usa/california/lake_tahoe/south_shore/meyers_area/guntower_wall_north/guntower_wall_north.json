A cool adventure being that it's a 60 m route.\n\nTIE A STOPPER KNOT at the end of the rope before belaying your leader, or better yet, TIE IN before beginning the climb so that you're already set up to follow after the leader sets the anchor for the top belay.Of course, be sure you have a setup for anchor and top belay and work out multipitch call signals before beginning. This route is almost exactly long enough for a 60 m rope.\n\nThe leader will have to top belay their second then climbers will rappel down to mussy hooks from the route immediately climber's right of it (The Bomb 10a/b), then rappel to the bottom from there. Each rappel is about 30 m, so be careful to find the midpoint of your rope and TIE STOPPER KNOTS at ends of rope for both rappels.\n\nLocate the mussy hooks of the adjacent route for the rappel before you start.\n\nA little cruxy clipping 8th bolt trusting slabbier moves if you canâ€™t clip high beforehand which is a taller move.","protection":"15 bolts ?","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"RmHjBqYBVE+LzBuHcxJFQg==","name":"The Dud","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Todd Offenbacher, Abe Greenspan","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.04562,38.84483]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"117604329","mp_crag_id":"113182022","climb_id":"RmHjBqYBVE+LzBuHcxJFQg==","areaRef":"9iZt6cN9Xu2kD+IDsE/d7w=="},"content":{"description":"From the base of the main crag you'll have to backtrack on the trail through some bushes to get to the start of this route","protection":"10 bolts","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"XNe9VT9NWIG7RILcMFHEfA==","name":"The Bomb","yds":"5.10a/b","grades":{"yds":"5.10a/b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Todd Offenbacher, Abe Greenspan","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.04562,38.84483]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"117604422","mp_crag_id":"113182022","climb_id":"XNe9VT9NWIG7RILcMFHEfA==","areaRef":"9iZt6cN9Xu2kD+IDsE/d7w=="},"content":{"description":"Far right route.
