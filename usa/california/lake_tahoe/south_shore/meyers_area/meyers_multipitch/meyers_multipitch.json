Steeper sections may have some hand holds or more textured rock for smearing. The crux, however, is very much dependent on smearing technique and is arguably harder than similarly graded routes (5.7) nearby at the Guntower Wall.\n\nThere are some run out sections where climbing is quite easy. Bolt spacing is more generous in crux areas. Could likely be heady for a new 5.7 leader, namely at the crux where climbing is friction dependent and there are little to no hands before a clip.\n\n* At the 4th pitch, 1st bolt may not be immediately visible. Traverse Left to tree and look up on the slab to your Left.\n\nThe second bolt is only visible once you've clipped the first bolt and moved out onto the face, but it's there. This pitch is only two bolts and then the anchor just to the Right of the big tree. Note that if you skip any bolts, it will remove helpful directionals and make the route more difficult for your follower.\n\nUnlike MU, you can easily see and hear your partner from each of the belay stations, which vary from very small to large ledges.\n\nRappel is NOT available. Anchors are 2 bolts with hangers.\n\nWalk off options:\n\n1) Follow the rock face climbers right until it ends (maybe 150m?), this is the start of a gully on the backside.
