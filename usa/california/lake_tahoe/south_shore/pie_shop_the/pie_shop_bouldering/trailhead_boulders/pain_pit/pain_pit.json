It hurts, and it’s hard not to dab.\n\nStart in the pit with a left hand undercling and right hand jam in the crack (see photos for specifics). From there, follow the crack to the right through a tight squeeze around the boulder. I find that a toe hook in the left hand start helps to avoid a dab on this squeeze. From there, the crack narrows down to painful finger size. Follow the crack up and right for several moves, then use the flake undercling to secure an awkward tight-squeeze topout.","protection":"This route is tricky to pad, especially in the tight section toward the topout. Don’t use huge pads or you may not be able to fit them in the pit. If you’re not comfortable with extra spicy fall zones, this might not be the route for you.","location":"Near the east end of Boulder D. Look between Boulder D and the small boulder with no climbs just east of it and you should see the finger crack section.
