Starts with a layback that runs towards the left turning into a fist size crack until you reach the slab about 40 feet up. After that it turns into a dirty slab that probably hasnâ€™t seen too much action. Not bad when the sun is beating down as it is covered most of the way up.\n\nI have no idea what the bolts were put in for, but it seems like it was to rap down to avoid the trail. We were practicing rappelling and found it was possible to climb back up. Watch out for poison oak at the bottom and if you have to, you can walk around the right size of the face on a dirty scramble.","protection":"2 solid bolts","location":"First clearing you find when hiking on the trail to the main area. There is a small trail, maybe 15 feet off of the main trail that cuts off. Look for the manzanita tree. Rap down and climb back up or hike around the right side."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,6d6152bc-0bbc-501a-9891-f11b5d49c911,f2c3db33-a8f4-5afc-a1c7-db5c8b227244,bbebf4a2-8c29-5da7-abd0-b1cf6874d8d8,69ccdb2c-f22e-5a6c-9a5d-8413233b3492,e9ab5fbc-30b3-52ef-8c7a-fd3359732f20","pathTokens":["USA","California","Lake Tahoe","Highway 50 Corridor","Placerville","Cosumnes River Gorge","Upper Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.70619,38.65071]},"bbox":[-120.70676577286544,38.65026033981814,-120.70561422713456,38.651159660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109718311","area_id":"6atfvDCzUu+Mev0zWXMvIA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-120.70676577286544,38.65026033981814],[-120.70561422713456,38.65026033981814],[-120.70561422713456,38.651159660181854],[-120.70676577286544,38.651159660181854],[-120.70676577286544,38.65026033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:53.223Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:31.909Z"}
