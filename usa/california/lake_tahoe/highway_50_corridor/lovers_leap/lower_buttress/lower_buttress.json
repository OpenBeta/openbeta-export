The last time I had a shot of this stuff I kept it down for about 30 second before the cauldron of my stomach boiled over and I filled a nearby pint glass with a foul brew.\n\nChances are if you're looking at this route on mp.com you've wandered by the lower buttress, seen those two pink poot slings hanging off that old pin and wondered 'what is that thing?' That thing is the seldom repeated Wild Turkey.  Located just uphill from the much smoother Crown Royal is a shallow corner with the pin about 25' up.\n\nStart up the dike face just right of the corner before working over left.  Continue up to the pin and take a good at it before you push your chips into the pot.  Look up... that giant knob is close... so close.\n\nAttack the roof, gain the knob and pull up.  By the way, that move is not 5.8.  Continue up and get established on the dikey slab headwall above.  Wind your way up, brushing lichen from dikes.  At some point falling will not be an option.  Eventually you will gain a series of right facing flakes which take some gear.  Right below a large dike the third flake is a good spot to belay and takes a couple hand size cams, about 150' up.\n\nThe second pitch continues up easy runout face.\n\nRick Sumner's old green Tahoe Rock guide says this about the route:  \"Rack: webbing slings and one 2 1/2 chock. Climb up a groove to the right side of a large ceiling; then traverse left along the celing's lip until possible to face climb up left to a horn. Continue until out of rope, then belay.

At the first big roof, traverse to the left side of the arête (into the left-facing corner). Get a few good jams before traversing back right onto the face at a prominent horn on the arête. Clip a bolt and climb up the face on 5.6R territory before reaching a second roof. Again, traverse left over the arête and onto a slightly overhung face for a few moves (really, only a few, don't try climbing up the overhung face too far), at which point you swing BACK onto the face and make some easy moves to the chains.\n\nRap (barely, with rope stretch) with a 70m rope, or (probably a better idea) with two ropes.","protection":"6 draws, singles from .5\" to 2\", long slings to keep the rope running smoothly.","location":"Starts on the right side of a 15' wide recess (Beer Can Alley), on the left side of Lower Buttress."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,6d6152bc-0bbc-501a-9891-f11b5d49c911,f2c3db33-a8f4-5afc-a1c7-db5c8b227244,b7663f40-eea7-5cad-8055-e8fe3e93288f,7f4e7b04-163f-5cd9-b630-d0c2dd4fbbdb","pathTokens":["USA","California","Lake Tahoe","Highway 50 Corridor","Lover's Leap","Lower Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":3,"label":"5.8"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":3,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":18,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":6,"intermediate":9,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":6,"intermediate":9,"advanced":5,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.13695,38.8003]},"bbox":[-120.13752697955839,38.799850339818136,-120.13637302044157,38.800749660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105734324","area_id":"f057BBY/XNm2MNDC3U+72w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":20,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:55.116Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:12:50.060Z"}
