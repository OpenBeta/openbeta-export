Mind the ground fall potential on a move or two.\n\nFrom there all the guides are vague about the finish. I followed my leader's wandering line up 5.7 to 5.9 rock (depending on the variations chosen) following adequately protectable cracks and features. If you meander as we did, also mind the rope drag. This influenced us to break it into two pitches halfway up a 60 meter rope, although we had enough rope to top out (certainly the route is less than 200 feet tall total).\n\nAll routes on Hogsback south go to the same largest tree described as a landmark in the Falcon guide. From the tree, they scramble up lower angle class 4, perhaps easy 5., to the level top of the formation (which is also the top of the rarely climbed fifth pitch of Better with Bacon on the north side of the Hogsback/Hogwild).\n\nNone of the Hogsback south stuff gets much action,  so expect much more lichen, moss and loose rock than on the training lines and classics.","protection":"Two bolts, followed by standard Leap trad pro, including longer slings to manage rope drag and lasso naturals.","location":"On the south face of the Hogsback. Try to follow use trails up from the Pony Express Trail to the steepest section. From the base of the face, look for Mike Carville's \"windswept tree\" just above halfway up the route.

The cracks and slabs are messy, but surely it will go - we'll be up and down quickly and back in time for tea...\n\nThe first pitch leads up and slightly right before the problem starts to appear. The flake / crack system leading to the obvious anchor vibrates ever so slightly when you hit it. Some bits are worse than others. There's just enough decent places to put pro, and you continue up and left onto the flake curving up to a small roof, where you there's enough cracks to feel good about building an anchor.\n\nFrom here, go slightly left, and up a small flared crack. There seems to be no easy way out here, but as the crack runs out, you can shuffle left over the ridge (great feeling of stepping into the unknown!) to find some bulbous features and an easy scramble up to the top, past a dead tree bent over in the shape of a Japanese Tori (watch out for rope drag here).\n\nWorth climbing?
