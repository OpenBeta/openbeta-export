Most of the climbing is less than vertical, but a couple small roofs and a short vertical section near the top make it memorable.\n\nBegin just left of Off-Width Their Heads (the odvious off-width crack) and work through the foot-less start to a tricky face that finally leads to the crux roof.  After pulling the roof, there's about 15 feet of 5.8 or 9 crack climbing.  After the crack you're left with a steep face before the climbing lets off as you gain the anchors.\n\nIn my opinion this route should be called 'Off With Their Shins' because messing up on the crux roof is likely to cause some bleeding in your shins... believe me.","protection":"4 bolts to a two bolt anchor.
