Caution should be used if attempting to lead the right hand variation as the protection bolt placed is totally worthless and will not protect you from a ground fall when pulling through the crux. A boulder pad is a better option than a rope. Both variations share the same bolt line for the rest of the climb (dirty 4th class), low-angle but with an easier cruxy move close to the anchors.
