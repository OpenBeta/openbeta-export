A couple of easy un protected face moves to gain a splitter hand crack for 40 feet (5.9). From here step onto the Spectrum tower proper and climb the crack past the \"sentry box\" (10c) and up to the bulge. Clip the bolt and move up and right (crux) into the brilliant sustained twin cracks to single finger crack finish. The upper 35 feet protect well (as does the entire route) but the gear placements are pumpy to hang out and place. I really love this climb and to successfully lead it is incredible satisfying.
