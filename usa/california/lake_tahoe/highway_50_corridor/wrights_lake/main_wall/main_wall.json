It is wise to use long slings on these two bolts - or to unclip the first bolt once past the difficult move - because you'll feel the rope drag up top.\n\nAfter the ledge, there's a .4\" or .5\" cam placement to protect moves on diagnol ramps/cracks below the first bolt.  At the first bolt, the climbing gets steep as you pull up a discontinuous crack system on the blunt arete.  Continue up this crack system as it gets less steep and leans to the right then power up to the finish.","protection":"Three bolts and gear to 3\".\n\nI'm 'pretty sure' you can walk around to the left to setup a top rope.
