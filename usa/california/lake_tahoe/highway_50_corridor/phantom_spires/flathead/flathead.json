The route has two sections: the first tier, a proper deep chimney, and the second tier, the chockstone.\n\nThe actual chimneying on this route is easier than the crux, surmounting the chockstone (5.6).\n\nThis is an adventuresome and easy route to the top.","protection":"Protecting the first part of the chimney may be possible, though I did not.  After the large ledge, on the second part of the chimney, small cams protect the crux.\n\nThere exists many options for a traditional anchor on the summit.","location":"This is the obvious chimney on the east face of the Flathead.  The Flathead is the formation to the north of Upper Spire.\n\nThe approach to the start of the route is straight forward: simply find your way up the slope to the base of the chimney.\n\nThe descent is easy.  Walk off the north side of the formation.  Hang a left and find your way down between Lost John and Flathead."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,6d6152bc-0bbc-501a-9891-f11b5d49c911,f2c3db33-a8f4-5afc-a1c7-db5c8b227244,15789bad-c217-5150-96e1-3ac08cb2a73c,35bcd267-7faf-5240-8b54-9fd3bd3b2598","pathTokens":["USA","California","Lake Tahoe","Highway 50 Corridor","Phantom Spires","Flathead"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.2457,38.7894]},"bbox":[-120.246276891328,38.788950339818136,-120.245123108672,38.789849660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108028647","area_id":"NbzSZ3+vUkCLVJ/TvTslmA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:51.925Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:12:47.270Z"}
