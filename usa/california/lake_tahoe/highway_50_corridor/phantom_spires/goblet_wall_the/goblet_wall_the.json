Make easier moves clipping two bolts to the right (in lieu of trad pro on those suspect blocks) to reach the gully. Avoid much loose stuff here. Now follow the left arete past another bolt or two, and the move from the final bolt to the anchor is the crux. Going left as the routesetter intends makes a 5.10c finish using underclings and friction. Keeping to the arete or going right around the corner makes for a 5.9ish balancy or edge-stepping finish move.","protection":"Place one piece of wide trad pro (3\" to 4\"?) in the right crack, clip four or five bolts, then something to rap off the anchors when done.\n\nTim noticed the bolt hangars are factory stamped 2011.
