Begin up a leftward ramp. From the top, you can clip the first bolt. Climb technical and powerful slab/face moves to the crack and up it, where the holds get more positive with big sporty moves that eventually go left on knobs and scoops. Doesn't let up until you're hugging the giant knob!\n\nYou can decrease the run-out between the 3rd bolt and the anchor with a .5 cam in the horizontal. I was able to make a blue totem work, but a bigger cam would have been better.\n\nIt's short, but this route packs a punch and is well worth doing! Twin Owls is more sheltered than the main spires and can be a good place to escape the wind.","protection":"3 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor with lower-off hooks","location":"This route is the obvious sport route on the south face of the East Twin Owl.
