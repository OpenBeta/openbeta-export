Starts with a lengthy and runout slab section. I felt this warranted at least a PG rating (MP only offers PG13/R/X), as there are just 4 bolts for ~50' of climbing through the slab section, and there are a handful of tricky slab moves above the bolts which would really suck to fall on.\n\nAfter mastering the slab, fire off through an awesome, quickly steepening overhang. This section is characterized by bouldery movement between a wide variety of holds. The route probably get its name from the moves in this section which frequently involve throwing your arms behind your head to grab the next hold.","protection":"Two bolts protect the intro slab and are not fixed. The remaining seven bolts are fixed with chain draws to lower-off anchors.","location":"The route is easy to identify by the line of fixed chain draws through the overhang.
