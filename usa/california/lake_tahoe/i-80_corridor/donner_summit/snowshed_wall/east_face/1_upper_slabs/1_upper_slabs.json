Pull over with crimps and seams and continue up the steep slab on small features. The crux comes after the lone bolt and involves a tenuous rockover to the left on minuscule crimps. Easy featured slab (dirty!!) to the top.\n\nThe Horniak guide shows a bolted anchor lower on the face, but we did not find it. Instead there are two very rusty cold shuts on the ledge at the top of the wall. I would recommend traversing right to use the better anchor for Telegraph Crack about 6 feet lower. The author also suggests 11c/d for the grade, but that seems like a hefty sandbag. Go up there expecting a 12- with spicy gear, friable footholds, and lots of lichen. In its current state, the route seemed like a harder onsight than Bell Bottom Blues.\n\nWith replaced anchors, a heavy cleaning, and--dare I suggest--another bolt or two, this route could become part of the typical Snowshed circuit.","protection":"An emphasis on cams in the 0.1-0.4 range and offset nuts should see you through. Many of the placements are suboptimal, and there's usually a variety of dubious choices--a real engineering challenge. The crux bolt seems to be on the older side but held several falls (much better than the anchors at least).","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"QvkesnK4U+i8Eo4o2cJ18Q==","name":"Reductio Ad Absurdum","yds":"5.11b","grades":{"yds":"5.11b","french":"6c"},"fa":"Dan Honneyman, 2015","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.31796,39.31581]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"110961691","mp_crag_id":"119317055","climb_id":"QvkesnK4U+i8Eo4o2cJ18Q==","areaRef":"/Mton6koX4aWDSg7fHEncQ=="},"content":{"description":"Arete R of Mole's Corner.
