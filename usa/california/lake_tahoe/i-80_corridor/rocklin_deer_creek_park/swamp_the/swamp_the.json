This starts off on an arete from some pallets in the water and climbs a hard 5.10 to a horizontal crack where a hard 5.11 move gets you onto the face. The crux is climbing the thin left facing corner to the top. there are two top outs. one goes straight up and the other climbs out right a bit. Definitely has some of the coolest moves I've pulled at Deer creek.","protection":"Must set up top rope on a tree and use a directional off a cam (.5-4 camalot) to stop the rope from wandering. Route must be top belayed due to rope drag.\n\nI know bolting is controversial here so I'm not sure whether or not I should bolt it and make it a lead climb. It's definitely tall enough and would be unreasonable to protect with pads. It would take three bolts and two for the anchor.
