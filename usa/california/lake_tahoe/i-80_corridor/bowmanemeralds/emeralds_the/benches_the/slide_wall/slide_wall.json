This route presents far more of a mental challenge than the easier climbs to it's left, and is more akin to Drowning Machine (it's neighbor to the right). While being technically quite moderate at 5.10a, this route feels more committing and heady. Recommended for confident 5.10- leaders.\n\nI'm giving this a PG-13 rating based on the rather precariously stacked pile of massive blocks which marks the beginning of the route. I extensively jumped around on said rock pile, they seem fine, but they are spooky. I recommend you take a nice long look at this stack before saying, \"yea, this is a good idea\". It's not the worst idea to have your belayer stand back a ways while you climb to the first bolt, just in case.\n\nFirst bolt is about 20 feet high after climbing low 5th class rock stacks.
