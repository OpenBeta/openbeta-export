From here bust straight up using some interesting side pulls and edges to a cool pocket. Continue straight up from here through more edges and a sloper to finishing jug under the White Riot anchors( lower to mid 5.13). Bouldery route, super fun, and deserves more attention!\n\n*****WARNING*****I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SKIPPING THE FIRST BOLT WITH THE BLUE TAG, PRE-CLIPPING & EXTENDING THE SECOND(OR ALSO SKIPPING), AND EXTENDING THE THIRD BOLT. You want to make sure the rope isn't going to get snagged under the sharp edge of the roof by the first two bolts!
