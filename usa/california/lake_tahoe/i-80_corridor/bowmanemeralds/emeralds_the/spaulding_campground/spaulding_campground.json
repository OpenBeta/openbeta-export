A mix of great, easy holds, and horribly thin slabby ones. The upper 20 ft or so is unprotectable slab after you step out at the top of the crack and mantle up. Watch out for angry ants at 20 ft in the shrubbery. Oh, and a bear got into the neighbor's bear-proof box that night and ate their snacks.","protection":"No bolts. Led bottom to top on a Silent partner. Small cams and small nuts, micros. An offset camalot size 2-3 might have done me good. One pocket for a #4 BD. Pins would be great. Bring a bolt for the slab. Rapped off the dead stump to clean.","location":"I suppose you could anchor off trees some 50 ft back, and the dead stump, and top rope this whole thing.
