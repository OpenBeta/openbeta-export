You want to get your left hand where your right hand starts on midnight mountain lion, to do so, I had to crimp the hold above the left hand start, if you can dyno straight over, that's impressive.\n\nAdding these moves makes this boulder much harder than midnight mountain lion, v5 might be a more accurate grading, however, the starting moves are harder than any v5 I have done.","protection":"Just a bouldering pad","location":"Center line on the Traverse boulder, just start lower than midnight mountain lion."},"__v":0},{"_id":"SCb6/S6+WQmHn6lM0tu9Ig==","name":"Midnight Mountainlion","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.0032,39.06697]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"113427438","mp_crag_id":"113427324","climb_id":"SCb6/S6+WQmHn6lM0tu9Ig==","areaRef":"VtaXCyLiWHKxASqLkSBflQ=="},"content":{"description":"This route is WONDERFUL!
