It was a project for me when I had first started climbing again, and at the time I thought it was upwards in grade. I met Jakob later on that year and decided to show him the block, and after warming up on the other jug-fest lines, he casually flashed the problem haha. He gave it a grade of V4. Jakob is a strong dude. I repeated it shortly after him. Since that time, I've developed lots of other boulders and grown significantly as a climber. I've brought other folks to this block, and to me this line still definitely feels like it's on the high end of V4, most likely V5. Jakob has yet to name it, so I've kept the original project name on it until he otherwise changes the title. For those who don't know Jakob, he is now one of the co-founders and owners of the climbing coop Gold Crush Climbing Gym, and he is also responsible for many of the other first ascents around the Yuba River and many new ones in the Tahoe region as well.\n\nProblem Beta:\n\nSit start on the far right of the block on decent holds. Move up left into the crimps on the face and go straight up through crimps and pockets and into the hueco. Very sustained beautiful movement.
