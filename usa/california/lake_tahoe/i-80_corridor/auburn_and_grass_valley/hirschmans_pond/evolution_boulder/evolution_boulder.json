There is a terrible landing, as you will fall onto a rock and break your back if you fall in the wrong spot. It starts out pretty easy. You start at the very left side of the lower boulder. The rocks to the left of this boulder are off. IT is easy to stay on this boulder, for you can lock your knees into a space under the upper boulder. After that, it gets harder. Do a very short traverse until you are right over a rock on the ground. Climb up the cruxy face, making sure that if you fall, you push away from the rock so you land safely instead of the rock on the ground.","protection":"Crash Pads","location":"On the same boulder as Evolution Face"},"__v":0},{"_id":"mLd0mdy6WF6gjM0CfAsf3w==","name":"Evolution Face","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"Alex McKenzie (possibly)","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.02961,39.26853]},"left_right_index":8,"mp_id":"113595315","mp_crag_id":"113863313","climb_id":"mLd0mdy6WF6gjM0CfAsf3w==","areaRef":"tS6RvYmJXy2niuBH2QdwQw=="},"content":{"description":"The clean dual boulder stack that may have been climbed before, but any info about this problem is unknown.
