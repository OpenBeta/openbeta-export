A 5.9 climb for 5.10 climbers. Bolts are further apart than normal for Auburn Quarry since it’s on a slab and is easier than the approach pitch. The second bolt is easy to reach, but be careful not to fall while clipping it due to the ledge below.\n\nThe route trends right from the anchors and follows the shallow S shaped corner over the lip of the cliff up to a nice ledge at the very top of wreckage wall. Most of the climbing takes place on the face to the left of the corner for the first half of the route until it crosses over it near the top.\n\nThis is a great multipitch practice route for a confident sport leader. Also has a great view from the top!\n\nRappel the route with a 70m rope or walk off the top all the way down to the backside of scale wall. The walk off is doable, but is kind of sketchy at one point and only for those who want a bit of an adventure.\n\n(Be very aware of climbers below you while you are climbing this and setting the rappels. The rock is solid and cleaned, but there is some dirt at the top and some pebbles may come down while you’re up there. TIE KNOTS AT THE END OF YOUR ROPE WHEN YOU RAPPEL)\n\n——————————————————————\n\nDo you think it is worth having this route accessible? There’s certainly a risk of rockfall to having climbers on the second pitch while there are people climbing below. That being said this route is fun and great to climb during a non-busy day.
