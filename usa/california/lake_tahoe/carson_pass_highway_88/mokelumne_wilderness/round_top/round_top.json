The climb is quick and easy and a good way to start your day.","protection":"Lots of cordelette to set up a TR, if you want to set up a true anchor you'll need a few #4s or #5s to make sure your gear doesn't walk. Or a set of nuts.

At the end of the trail there is a small scramble, scramble up the rocks and continue to climbers left, scramble across a patch of boulders and you'll see a couple of cracks (yet to be established). Go just past the first cracks and you'll find a crack in a dihedral and that's nuts and seeds.
