Typically called class 4, and most moves on it are that: intuitively ladder-like. I called it easy 5th because there were a couple of distinctly climbingish moves on it that a scrambler wouldn't usually encounter (at the chimney, and especially starting the downclimb from the top). If using a rope, the summit route breaks naturally into two short pitches.","protection":"The volcanic stone is quite loose and covered in gravel, especially after recent rain. More of a \"sling it and see\" place than holes for chocks. I think many people free solo it.","location":"Circumnavigate the peak to scramble loose but easy class 2 and 3 terrain to the start of the largest gully on the south face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,6d6152bc-0bbc-501a-9891-f11b5d49c911,b9f8ec09-9fa9-5afe-8b68-a68ecda3e0ea,b61d4995-8cd0-5c9c-85f0-0d89fda25367,02aca6eb-6684-551b-8131-cdc6a3b5c88f,ac35e61b-0cb0-5f88-b73e-f8165b6d3d28","pathTokens":["USA","California","Lake Tahoe","Carson Pass Highway (88)","Mokelumne Wilderness","Border Ruffian Flat","J.D.
