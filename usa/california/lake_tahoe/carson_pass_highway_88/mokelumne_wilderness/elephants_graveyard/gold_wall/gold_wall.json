There's a wide (hip width) crack to the left and a rattly finger / thin hand crack to the right.\n\nSteeper than it looks from the meadow 15 feet from the base. Various hand jams that didn't feel as nuclear as I always wanted. Awkward rests.\n\nNote: I tried to climb the right crack direct - this \"eliminate\" is a different route and I'd peg it at 11-something.","protection":"Gear. Two-bolt anchor + chains up top. Hardware looks 6.5/10.\n\nA 6 (or larger) might be nice for parts of the wide on lead, though there's room for 1/2/3s deep.","location":"Cairns are somewhat inconsistent and don't link well - didn't always see the next cairn from the last. That's okay - you can mostly cross-country if you get lost after setting your sights on the cliff from the parking spot in the grove of trees (\"#1\" in Cottrel's guide), but _try_ to stay on the trail and limit erosion."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,6d6152bc-0bbc-501a-9891-f11b5d49c911,b9f8ec09-9fa9-5afe-8b68-a68ecda3e0ea,b61d4995-8cd0-5c9c-85f0-0d89fda25367,1e29b39a-58bb-5159-b3e0-9d48714d2d62,bce6c171-cc80-592b-b442-96cc11fc8e05","pathTokens":["USA","California","Lake Tahoe","Carson Pass Highway (88)","Mokelumne Wilderness","Elephant's Graveyard","Gold Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.97896,38.6668]},"bbox":[-119.97953590222751,38.666350339818145,-119.97838409777249,38.667249660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113559396","area_id":"vObBccyAWSu0QpbMEfyOBQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:08.060Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:13:02.729Z"}
