Depending on your comfort with chimneys, a #4-5 might be wanted...or might prove totally unnecessary for you.

You actually can climb it without the #4 (as I did), but I really wished I had it about 15-20 feet after the crux.  Smaller gear can be had here but not as easy to pop in quickly; however, your skill and mileage may vary.  A #3 can be pushed in toward the back of the OW down low.","location":"Sits between Sun Wall Right and Sun Wall Left (imagination at work).\n\nTo get off, climb left along the blocks at the top.
