There are two options for first pitch. Option 1 step left at bushy ledge after a short jam crack and tunnel through (5.8+?) a gigantic stuck block to reach belay ledge.

A small runout is required for this 2nd option, but is the more appealing and more direct climbing for sure.\n\nP2: From the two bolt anchor, step right to gain the first crack system.

Fight up this crack and use face features right to gain a tiny ledge which has the final splitter fingers to the chains that are just below a small roof.\n\nClassic Woodfords in the sense it looks like slab 5.7 from the ground, but is rather steep and pretty difficult at solid mid .10\n\nRappel off.","protection":"Standard Sierra rack to 3\"\n\nFirst bolted anchor doesn't have rings or chains, we left two biners (Dec '18).
