Some loose and crumbly rock exists in the crack and it ends poorly.  The middle of the climb has nice hand jams while the pillar is a fun feature to climb.  Overall a route of average quality.\n\nThe first crux comes from getting off the ground and a second crux comes from leaving a stance and gaining the hand crack just after the roof traverse.  Higher up there is a small crack on the left wall that accepts nuts and smaller cams.","protection":"Standard rack with a couple 3-4\" cams to protect the roof traverse under the arch.","location":"The climb follows the left side of the namesake detached reddish pillar on the east side of the crag.
