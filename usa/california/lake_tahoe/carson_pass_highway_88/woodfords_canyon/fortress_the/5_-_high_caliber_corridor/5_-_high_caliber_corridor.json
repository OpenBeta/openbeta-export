With just about every climbing style represented this pitch reveals it's many cruxes like so many chapters in an epic novel.\n\nChapter One:\n\nSurmount a steep roof right off the deck via a powerful boulder problem to gain a short, thin book. Thin pro combined with difficult moves probably make this the technical crux of the climb.\n\nChapter Two:\n\nMove easily up to a second, steeper corner, the base of which has some looseness to it. Crank up the corner utilizing thin pro and beautiful moves.\n\nQuality.\n\nChapter Three:\n\nAt a pumping \"rest\" assess the crack looming above. Then cast off into the wide, physical slot/crack that defines draining. A long reach helps here.\n\nChapter Four:\n\nExit the slot to an overhanging and seemingly blank dihedral. Finesse your way upwards with precise body english. What helped those with long arms on the previous section will hurt them now. The vertically-challenged will find this stretch easier.\n\nChapter Five:\n\nEscape the corner left, clip a bolt, and send the 5.10 slab to the top.","protection":"Micro wires, standard stoppers and a single set of cams from 3/8\" to 3\". The pitch ends at a two-bolt rap station with chains.","location":"Pigeons on the Roof starts above the fourth class step on the right side of the High Caliber Corridor The line is inobvious at first; look for a short corner near the ground with an undercut roof at its base. Once on the route it becomes apparent (as it's the natural weakness).\n\nThe bolts at the top are also a rap station for climbers descending from the climbs located above. This makes it easy to set Pigeons up as a TR. Using directionals helps to get back on if you fall as the climb is deceptively steep and leans to the left."},"__v":0},{"_id":"mIxhM0+mXdm9ri7dGoDIrg==","name":"Mr. Personality","yds":"5.12a","grades":{"yds":"5.12a","french":"7a+"},"fa":"Dan Kennedy, Jerome Fitz, Ryan Curry","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.85241,38.76948]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106363197","mp_crag_id":"106363192","climb_id":"mIxhM0+mXdm9ri7dGoDIrg==","areaRef":"jO6Ym8Q2Vx2akadrFDr8zQ=="},"content":{"description":"Featuring fun moves on great rock, Mr. Personality is simply fantastic.
