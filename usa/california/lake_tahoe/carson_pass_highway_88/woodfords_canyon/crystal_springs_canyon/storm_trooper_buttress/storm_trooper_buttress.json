It is sustained, technical and BADASS. Make your way up the crack facing difficult moves throughout the diagonal section. Easier climbing comes when the crack goes vertical, make a couple traverse moves then continue up the broken crack system where more pumpy hard climbing comes, ultimately finishing on the steep lazer splitter. Taversing to the ledge is an option for a shorter version of the route. Gear can be creative but is all there. It includes 1 pin that I would not recommend taking a fall on, but it is still a comfort to clip as other forms of pro would be difficult. Anchors have been updated on the ledge and added for the belay at the start of the crack (courtesy of Shredmands). An amazing line that needs to be enjoyed more. Thanks Dan O!","protection":"Nuts, doubles of black alien through #1 camalot. Triples of .4 and .3 would be helpful as well.","location":"The obvious crack in the middle of the red wall. Start on the slab that can be accessed via fixed line or easy scramble off right in the willows."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,6d6152bc-0bbc-501a-9891-f11b5d49c911,b9f8ec09-9fa9-5afe-8b68-a68ecda3e0ea,e4ddadeb-4e72-5e50-837d-0ee7490051b1,105b8896-0860-5528-85e2-a301a32f720d,39d76bbb-d540-5db9-9f99-586259f58141","pathTokens":["USA","California","Lake Tahoe","Carson Pass Highway (88)","Woodfords Canyon","Crystal Springs Canyon","Storm Trooper Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.84748,38.76387]},"bbox":[-119.84805668486179,38.76342033981813,-119.84690331513818,38.76431966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110669353","area_id":"Oddru9VAXbmfmVhiWfWBQQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.84805668486179,38.76342033981813],[-119.84690331513818,38.76342033981813],[-119.84690331513818,38.76431966018186],[-119.84805668486179,38.76431966018186],[-119.84805668486179,38.76342033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:56.436Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:34.990Z"}
