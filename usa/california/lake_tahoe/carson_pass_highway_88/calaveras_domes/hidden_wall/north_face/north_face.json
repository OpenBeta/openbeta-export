The whole route can be spotted from the ground with a sharp eye and a decent pair of binoculars.\n\nPitch 1 climbs a mossy corner (5.6) which has many ways one could ascend. Climb to the base of a right facing corner which makes up the right side of a prominent pillar.\n\nPitch 2 Climbs the right facing corner (.10a). Do not go to the top of the pillar. There is a 1/4 in bail bolt up there. If you see this, you've gone too far. Instead, before reaching the top of the pillar, traverse right to a triangular downward sloping ledge (.10b) which brings you into a steep grass filled corner system capped by a massive roof.\n\nPitch 3 climbs out right from the corner past a bolt (5.9) and some gear and rounds the arete to a splitter hand crack on the face. Follow the crack (.10c) to a two bolt anchor.\n\nPitch 4 climbs behind a massive detached flake and up a splitter finger crack (.10c) and back out onto the face. Negotiate a dirty short left facing corner (crux .11c) and back onto the face to a big ledge system at the base of two wide cracks.\n\nPitch 5 climbs the left side crack (5.9) too a ledge with a two bolt anchor above. The right side offwidth has not been climbed but looks fantastic.\n\nRappel the route with two 60m ropes back to the base.","protection":"Cams, doubles from .4\" to 3\".
