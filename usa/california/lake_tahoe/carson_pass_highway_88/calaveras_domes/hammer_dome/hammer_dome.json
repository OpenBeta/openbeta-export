As in, I barely squeaked my way up this climb.  Expect amazing, hard friction and smedge climbing for pretty much the whole 200 feet. Unlike some of the other more grotty, flakey rock found on some of the other face routes on Hammer Dome, the rock on this route is exquisite. The rock is brilliantly yellow, white, and orange colored and is water case-hardened to perfection. This route goes as one single 200 foot pitch, but there are anchors midway at 100 feet.\n\nClimb past 5 bolts, clip the first set of anchors, and then climb past 4 more bolts to the second set of anchors. Keep in mind that this is not bolted like a sport route. Expect to do some hard climbing between the somewhat well-spaced bolts (albeit safely).\n\nThere is a variation to the first pitch called Shrieks of Bold (also very good). The variation is the right of the two bolt lines. Climb past 6 bolts and clip the first anchors and merge with Squeaks of Gold for the final 4 bolts. Perhaps a hair harder than the standard version (maybe 11b'ish).\n\nI thought that the route was great, but a little punishing; WAY harder and more continuous than 'Glide Slope' (11a) over on the nearby Deer Creek Dome.","protection":"Draws for 10 bolts (11 if you do the variation).","location":"Directly under the belay for the end of the first pitch of Wings and Stings are two bolts lines (all three routes actually share a set of anchors).

The line begins in an arching crack and flake system that leads to a clean friction slab peppered with thin knobs. The route takes the thin crack right of Gemini and continues above for two more pitches.\n\nP1: Climb through a right-arching series of flakes and cracks. Pull onto the face above as the arch system peters out. Climb past 2 bolts to a bolted anchor.\n\nP2: Friction and knob climbing on a steep face. A fun and well-protected pitch. Go straight up and then trend right past 8 bolts to a bolted anchor.\n\nP3: Climb the face past two bolts. Trend left to clip one last bolt before heading up to a bolted anchor. This anchor is shared with Gemini Cracks, positioned directly beneath the twin cracks.\n\nP4: Climb the thin crack just to the right of the classic final pitch of Gemini Cracks; an exquisite and not to be missed pitch. This pitch ends at a shared bolted anchor with Gemini (5.10b/c; take a bunch of thin gear from smallish nuts through about a 0.75 Camalot ).\n\nP5: Climb straight up from the belay about 10 feet to a ramp/dike. Next traverse straight left for 20+ feet until you can step up and clip a bolt. The climbing is easy here, but be cautious as a fall will result in a 25 footer directly onto the belay. Climb up from the first bolt passing a couple more bolts and a cruxy 5.9 bulge. After the bulge you can get a blue or yellow TCU (or something similar) in a horizontal crack before you need to run it out on pretty easy ground to gully of sorts. Get some gear at the base of the gully (around a #2 Camalot) and climb up to the top of the pillar that makes up the right side of the gully. There is a bolted anchor at the top. (5.9; bolts and a couple pieces of gear).\n\nP6: Wander up and left to the base of an obvious headwall. Climb the bolted headwall. I don't recall whether there are bolted anchors at the top of this pitch, so it is probably prudent to bring something to sling a tree etc.\n\nThe fourth pitch really shouldn't be missed because not only does it climb an amazing crack, but it provides a great counterbalance to the smeary face climbing of the first few pitches. The fifth and sixth pitches are worth doing at least once, but are not as good as pitches 2-4.","protection":"Pro to 2.5\". 8 QDs.","location":"Park where the road crosses the aqueduct east of Hammer Dome.
