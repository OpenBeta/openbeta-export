You can tell that the climbing goes up and to the right in a slight dihedral/crack to the first bolt, and from there continues straight up following a series of cracks. Route finding shouldn't be too difficult on this one.Fun climb with lots of large holds, lots of which you can either practice your crack technique, or use them as side-pulls. Some guides books have this as an 10a others as an 10b, after all 3 of us climbed it, we sorta looked at each other determined we agree with those who have it as a 10b. While I'm critiquing guide books, I'd also mention that we hardly sawÂ any bat shit or bats on the climb. So while some say the bat presence detracts from the quality of the climb, I say it was fun shit since we encountered no trace of bat infestation.Still, though, I'll remind you to keep an eye out for bats in some of the underclings you encounter.","protection":"6 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor.

It begins in front of a big tree a little uphill of the other climbs.\n\nMy eval: there are 5.10 b/c moves 8 to 12 feet over the bolts, including one longish runout in the middle. Down low around the second bolt is a little tricky in groundfall potential. Up high, the falls are safe, but if you go, youre going to take a big ride. Just breath, there are good holds up there, and the hardest moves are nearer the bolts. The crux is moving off a sharp finger lock to a couple of small sidepulls after doing the runout section in the middle.\n\nPG-13 would be a good warning. Not quite Serious.\n\nThere's a ton of lichen and moss on this thing, but most of the climb is out of it. It is still clean enough and scary enough to be a good climb. Just be careful down low around the 2nd bolt.\n\nNOTE: Belay from down the ramp. Don't belay from under the tree. If the leader takes the 20-footer, you don't want to hit your head on the tree or get tangled up in it.","protection":"7 bolts to a two bolt anchor.

The left variation is safer, with three or four bolts down low, but offers only 5.8-5.9 climbing for those first 25 feet. I didn't do the R section, so I can't comment on the features there.

The bolting protects the climb just fine and the route is sustained and technical for fifty or sixty feet.\n\nFinally, there is an airy crux up high to the anchors. Totally safe fall.
