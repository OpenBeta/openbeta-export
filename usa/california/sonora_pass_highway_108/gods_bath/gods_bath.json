Be careful as the waterfall might make you slip. Work it into a layback steering left, then there's a big enough opening to hand jam, work your feet and then wedge your way up using the wall on your right to smear your feet. You should be able to stem for about 5 feet until you get to some cracks and hand jams. Once you get as high as you can on the crack, look to your left or behind you and there will be a jug you can dyno to or get to by cutting feet. Scariest parts are the heelhook, stemming, and jug near the finish. Once you get to the jug it's easy, just mantle up toward the tree.","protection":"Water below you is deep.
