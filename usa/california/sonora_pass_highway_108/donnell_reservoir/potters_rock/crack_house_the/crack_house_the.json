There is also a large bush set about 50 feet off the ground that you will have to contend with when you get to it.  There are several techniques that will get you up this strenuous route, however none are pretty.","protection":"Bring BIG pro (up to 5\") for protection.\n\nTo set up a top-rope, you can walk around the right side to the back side of the rock. There are several trees that can be used to set up a top rope, bring a short sling (3') and a longer sling (10') for a backup. Beware that this approach to set up a top rope is at best awful and slippery, at worst a 40 foot tumble down the steep leafy hillside.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"361jxGhtUe62AOdpeVhEDA==","name":"Project","yds":"5.12","grades":{"yds":"5.12","french":"7b+"},"fa":"you, perhaps","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.0088,38.26965]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105734921","mp_crag_id":"105734159","climb_id":"361jxGhtUe62AOdpeVhEDA==","areaRef":"DQXK2u0tW+iOOl5yaheB3w=="},"content":{"description":"This project is an overhanging and outward flaring off-width crack located on the right side of the Crack House.  Bruce Bindner placed the bolts on top of it to keep people from using the loose flake for pro, or anything else.  He also recommends that the route be named \"Ebola\" once someone sends it \"because it is sick,\" and because the skin contusions you're sure to receive are similiar to those of an ebola victim after some internal organs have burst.","protection":"There's a couple of bolts with chains fixed at the top of the climb.  To set up a top rope from them, rap down from a trad anchor atop the Crack House, also put a directional cam in to keep yourself from swinging into the slab behind you in the event that you fall.  Leading this climb requires a 9\" and 6\" cam, as well as perhaps a 4\" piece.  Finally, there is an enormous loose flake atop the crack, left of the anchors that you probably shouldn't even touch unless you're intending to kill your belayer.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,327bafd8-74a6-554b-b487-93aff233501f,ee6b6037-2078-5a25-ab4b-c5ba9996a441,d5a9c2a2-e8ad-551e-ae93-ad847798a5a8,0d05cada-ed2d-5be8-8e3a-5e726a1781df","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sonora Pass Highway (108)","Donnell Reservoir","Potter's Rock","Crack House, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.0088,38.26965]},"bbox":[-120.00937273922946,38.269200339818134,-120.00822726077055,38.270099660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105734159","area_id":"DQXK2u0tW+iOOl5yaheB3w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:23.344Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:14:16.222Z"}
