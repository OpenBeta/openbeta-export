The paved trail will head left after the bridge, and then make a big right turn. About 100' after the bend, walk off the trail and to your left, aiming for the right side of a mound of boulders. When you reach the talus, angle up and left, aiming for a small dead tree in the middle of the talus field and a larger dead tree need the top of the hill.
