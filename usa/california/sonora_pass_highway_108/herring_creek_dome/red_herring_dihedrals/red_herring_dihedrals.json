The dihedral can also be seen from the top of The Herring Dome.\n\nThe rock is granite, with beautiful red, orange and pink colors making the visual stimulation on the climb sometimes a little too much.\n\nStarting in the corner, traverse through the bush and head up a sustained face using the arete as necessary. The route is sustained .10a, and if you're not acclimatized, it will feel like a considerably tougher climb. Some pockets are huge, some are small, but the climbing gets easier up at the top.\n\nTo approach this climb: Set up a trad (placements are plentiful) anchor on the dihedral above the climb, and rappel down to the top anchor, over the corner and down the face of the climb to a medium sized belay area. The preferred approach rope would be a single 60 meter rope, which will reach the talus field below, and using another rope to climb the route.\n\nAnother alternative approach is to climb the sketchy class 3 up to the base of the climb from the talus field below.\n\nGetting out of the belay area either requires you to downclimb (or rappell) into the talus field, or to climb the route.","protection":"3 bolts to a 2 bolt top anchor. A 1\" friend will be helpful in ensuring that an initial fall doesn't send you 60 feet down the rocky cliff below.\n\nThis can also be lead with pro, using mostly medium to large pieces (1\" - 4\")","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,1e18b6dd-d8b1-5c36-b555-175190184622,327bafd8-74a6-554b-b487-93aff233501f,5dba55e7-bacf-526e-9ee8-8c991b9b4252,6c7f54a7-1e41-588c-bc0d-5341f68d314c","pathTokens":["USA","California","Sonora Pass Highway (108)","Herring Creek Dome","Red Herring Dihedrals"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-119.92743,38.22472]},"bbox":[-119.92800238531017,38.22427033981814,-119.92685761468985,38.22516966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105734165","area_id":"bH9Upx5BWIy8DVNB9o0xTA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-119.92800238531017,38.22427033981814],[-119.92685761468985,38.22427033981814],[-119.92685761468985,38.22516966018186],[-119.92800238531017,38.22516966018186],[-119.92800238531017,38.22427033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:54:29.863Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:29:35.621Z"}
