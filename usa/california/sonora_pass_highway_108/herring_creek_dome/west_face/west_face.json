All gear is thin and marginal. Biggest piece we used was a #1 tricam.\n\nAlso, the big 12' high column marked in the topo is more to the right, closer to the top of the climb than is shown.\n\nThis info is(was) correct as at 2 - Sept - 2001.\"","protection":"1 set of cams 1/2\" - 1\", an extra 1/2\"-3/4\" cam,  and a few slings.
