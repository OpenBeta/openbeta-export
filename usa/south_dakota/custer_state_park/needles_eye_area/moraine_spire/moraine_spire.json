There is also a chimney on the east side which can be climbed.  The crack is more on the southeast corner of the spire.  Climb up this crack with poor quality rock caused by the road blast, working your way up and left.  Be careful of jugs - they do break on this route.  You'll get a good rest at a large flake which you can sling before continuing up the face following a small crack, moving slightly right and onto the arete for the last few moves. \n\n  If you can keep your head together through the crumbly and difficult to protect 5.8 moves down low, the top of the spire offers excellent quality rock, high exposure, and very delicate moves on extremely small crystals with extra spice due to the lack of good quality protection.","protection":"Standard rack with extra small pieces.  It's definitely useful to have small nuts, TCUs, and maybe some Aliens or something similar.  The last 15 feet is protected by a piton that's bent in half and a rusty bolt which has popped about halfway out of the rock.  The anchors on top should be replaced but are still usable.  Some who are more cautious may not wish to trust these anchors.  Please do not leave any webbing either on the flake or up top.  You can backup the belay for the second by slinging the large top of the spire with some webbing.","location":"Follow the tunnel until you see a crumbly looking crack on your left to find the start.  A 60 m rope will get you back down to the tunnel."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,eb71723c-d454-5686-9f66-8bbd19c7143e,9d2e1b0f-8212-5b6e-80f9-5fd3b4a983a4,29848d0c-d3dd-5b0d-9314-2faac05ccd39","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Custer State Park","Needles Eye Area","Moraine Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.5458,43.84169]},"bbox":[-103.54642344011481,43.84124033981813,-103.54517655988519,43.84213966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106729924","area_id":"KYSNDNPdWw2TFC+qwFzNOQ=="},"content":{"description":"The Moraine Spire is a slender pinnacle that lies on the west side of the Needles Eye Tunnel, very close to Bloody Spire.  There are four known routes up the spire.  Those who climb any route that starts on the east side (tunnel side) of Moraine Spire should beware - the rock quality can be poor due to the blasting done for the tunnel.  Also, stay out of the way of unaware tourists in the tunnel.  Perhaps this spire is best climbed early or late season.
