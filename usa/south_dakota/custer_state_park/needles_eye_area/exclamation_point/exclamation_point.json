It shares the same start as the Conn route which is the tight chimney on SE side which separates Exclamation Point from the lesser formations to the east. After just a few feet of chimney climbing, move left to follow an obvious crack system directly up the face. After a horizontal, the crack becomes more of a seam in a subtle corner/groove. The crux is a bit sporty and is protected by very small gear. Bring small nuts and your smallest micro-cams. After a short ways the crack opens up again to fingers, then a handcrack leads through a bulge. Above that, the crack ends and three bolts lead through very juggy knobs and another overhang to the summit. \n\n  To descend, rappel from a bolted anchor with 2 ropes down the very sheer south face. Or we made it down with one 70m by rappelling directly back down the climb and downclimbing the first few moves of the start of the route (sort of tricky).","protection":"Pro to 3\" with extra small stuff, 3 bolts.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"eW0CHt8MWdahipZHs2X+NQ==","name":"Fenton-Oslund Route","yds":"5.8+","grades":{"yds":"5.8+","french":"5b"},"fa":"Renn Fenton and Peter Oslund circa 1965","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.5458,43.84169]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"107313776","mp_crag_id":"107313769","climb_id":"eW0CHt8MWdahipZHs2X+NQ==","areaRef":"ILu03UFoVjmyyqSuxlapEQ=="},"content":{"description":"A great trad climb with just enough of a spook factor to give it a hint of headiness and an impending sense of danger. Much more than Goldline. \n\n  Starts in the boulder field. Work your way up a crack system and move to the right into a larger crack system. The crux is escaping the pod you encounter about halfway up. The protection is good here, use some larger nuts and/or some smaller cams.  \n\n  Once you have escaped the pod you'll find yourself at a face with some crumbly, yellow rock. Move left and around the corner to gain access to a ramp enclosed in a chimney feature. \n\n  Place a larger cam in the crack in the ramp of the chimney if you feel the need and work your way to the anchors. Summit register is a short hike to a larger summit above the rap anchor. \n\n  Enjoy the airy repel! This is a very doable climb for competant leaders who are good at judging safe gear placements and have a good lead head capable of convincing the body to just keep moving up.","protection":"Standard Rack.
