I was forced to drill out the hole I had started with a 3/8\" drill. The 3/8\" bit kept binding. I had drilled the hole once almost. After fighting with the redrill process I decided to stand in a sling on the bolt below to finish the hole. This was justification for the chopping in Muehl and Archbold's minds.
