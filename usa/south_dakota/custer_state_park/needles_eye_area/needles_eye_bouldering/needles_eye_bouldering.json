This problem was put up by Colorado hardman Justin Jaeger. This attacks the steep highball bulge on the boulder. Speaking with Chip Phillips in person a few years back when he was visiting the Hills. He recounts Justin working this problem and said the crux came at the top of the boulder (climb) and was super commiting to try and mantle a holdless  bulge at 15+ feet. When i find the photo Justin sent i will get it up. Great route and good boulder. ","protection":"crash pads spotter","location":"Drainage boulder that Bob Kamps climbed alot on. "},"__v":0},{"_id":"+oHa37biW9aerWuuSWKASw==","name":"Raw Edge","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.54629,43.84223]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"116584096","mp_crag_id":"116584101","climb_id":"+oHa37biW9aerWuuSWKASw==","areaRef":"1tQ4Gb3tXQqu1FfWWa1Ysg=="},"content":{"description":"This problem starts on a boulder touching the base of the Needles Eye.
