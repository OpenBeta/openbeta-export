It can be mistaken for Spire Two from a distance, as it completely obstructs the view from the parking lot.  If you look at the beta photo of the Cathedral Spires, the one that I have numbered as 2 is really Balcony Point.   \n\n  This is a large spire, and it requires around 3 pitches to get to the top.  One common way of climbing it is a beautiful crack that leads up from the saddle of Spire Two and Balcony Point.  Descend by rappelling from the summit of Balcony Point to the saddle with Spire Two, and then follow its rappel down the east face route (two ropes necessary)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:16.229Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:32.757Z"}
