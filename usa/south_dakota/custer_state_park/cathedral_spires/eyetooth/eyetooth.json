Follow the obvious crack up and left on to the southwest side of the spire. There is a fixed pin in the crack up high if I remember correctly. Move up out of the crack and right onto the south face to clip a big new bolt (better than the scary old nail that used to stick out of the face). The angle eases off on the face and the climbing changes completely. The face is very small crystals which you friction and smear on and palm a few holds - really cool. Climb up to the beefy 2 bolt anchor and belay. A double rope rappel brings you to the base of the route. Classic Needles must do with good gear, fun climbing and good exposure on one of the coolest spires in the Needles.","protection":"Standard rack, fixed gear.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"EPP+B0ybVFS5KwlLEPRm9g==","name":"Dental Dam","yds":"5.12+","grades":{"yds":"5.12+","french":"7c"},"fa":"Chris Hirsch, Shankar Zamora, Matt Scherer; ground-up June 2020","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.53319,43.84915]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118973074","mp_crag_id":"105714450","climb_id":"EPP+B0ybVFS5KwlLEPRm9g==","areaRef":"ZgfdRYsHXImRvmCE23xTqg=="},"content":{"description":"This all-gear route climbs the steep North side of Eyetooth.
