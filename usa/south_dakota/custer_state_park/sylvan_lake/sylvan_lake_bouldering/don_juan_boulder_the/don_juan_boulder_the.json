In a grassy medow. Most people today know it as \"The Mood Swings Boulder.\" The boulder has 3 problems that I know of. The problem Mood Swings (V10)  was an old Larry Schafer project. The story of this boulder is a interesting one. None the less it doesn't see much traffic. There is another problem on the backside opposite of Mood Swings that looks kind of similar to a mini Orange Roughy. ( Orange Roughy V6 is a classic problem at Old Baldy, Rushmore.) this problem seems about the same grade if not harder but I have never climbed it so don't take my word on it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:12.465Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:44.458Z"}
