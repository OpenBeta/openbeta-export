This boulder was first cleaned and kept \" secret\" it was first envisioned by Colorado climber Chuck Fryberger. It wasn't until a few years ago a group of climbers really put some effort into it. The bottom is sharp and that's what kept it elusive. The crimps are good at the bottom. Matt Cochran and Taylor Lais almost had this thing sent a few years back but lack of pads and spotters kept it unclimbed. It resparked interest but would take another 2 years to finally get it finished up. Crux is the first couple of moves and then transitioning onto the arête. Once you are able to stand up on the arête it should be cake walk to the top. This is a highball boulder. You will need more than one crash pad to feel safe. Spotter is a huge plus. This problem will be in line with Acid Test for test pieces of Sylvan Lake. Beautiful Line."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:12.470Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:27.805Z"}
