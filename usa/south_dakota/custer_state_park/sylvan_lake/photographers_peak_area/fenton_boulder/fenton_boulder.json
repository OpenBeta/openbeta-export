This bouler was mainly bouldered out by Renn Fenton. Later John Page added variations. Look for a huge almost slab like boulder leaning up against Photographers Peak by the parking area. Anchors were installed not sure when but they are looking pretty old. Routes can be top-roped or soloed. Routes tend to have nice crystals with a slight bulge up top. Cruxs down low with a few problems up high and committing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:11.999Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:15.919Z"}
