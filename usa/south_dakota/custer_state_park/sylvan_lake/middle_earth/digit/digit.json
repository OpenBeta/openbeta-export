The resemble fingers with Digit being the highest finger. When driving through the switchbacks up to Sylvan lake look to your left and on the southwest corner you will see the fingers with Digit. A small turn out is the easiest access to the spire. Turnout is past the switchbacks right where you hit the top if the hill. 2 known routes exist. Short climbs 1 route has 1 bolt on it. What these climbs lack in length they make up for with exposure on the west face ( where both climbs start) the view is stunning of the Nelson creek area as well.
