Continue to the top passing a couple more bolts along the way. \n\n  The route was done ground-up, some drilling was done from hooks, and was completed on the second effort.  The first attempt failed when a handhold broke off, resulting in a 35' fall from 40' up, as well as lots of blood, stitches, and rock rash.  Second effort went much better, but the route needs one more bolt.  \n\n  The sword Narsil was broken in the overthrow of Sauron at the end of the Second Age.","protection":"Take 8 draws for bolts and a few long slings for horns and knobs.
