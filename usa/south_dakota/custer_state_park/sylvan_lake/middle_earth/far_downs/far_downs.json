Stands out even in an area (Middle Earth ) that has classic after classic. The route goes up a steep water chute with some pretty unique features. I remember thinking \"wow\" a few times. Stick clip bolt one. The crux start is a boulder problem on blackish rock to pull an overhang. Has a technichal set up and a punchy finish to pull the overhang. Goes left, right, or center-- each with its own unique challenge. Then work up past a flake. Bit runout to bolt 2, but it is a pretty easy crystal-speckled slab. After a couple of crack-climbing moves, one hits a slightly overhanging headwall feature with some weird slopey knobs. These interesting knobs appear amber-colored if the light hits them right. Smearing and compressioning the knobs brings you to another slab that steepens toward a physical grunty chimney that eases off eventually. Hike a brief gulley to one more slab move guarding the anchors in a notch. Packs a lot into 100 feet!","protection":"Two bolts plus standard rack.","location":"Most people will access this climb by circling around the southwest end of the Far Downs Mass past the prominent 5.8- slab climb Bard. Follow the Far Downs Mass north and east. West of the Sun will be first climb you come too... Radbug  also 5.11- is just a bit farther in. "},"__v":0},{"_id":"yGecm0PbUpuC+9xFndtBlw==","name":"Smaugs Tail","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"Paul Muehl","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.57106,43.84867]},"left_right_index":6,"mp_id":"112518241","mp_crag_id":"106538500","climb_id":"yGecm0PbUpuC+9xFndtBlw==","areaRef":"tlCcYAAKWzCDKamo7FjzhQ=="},"content":{"description":"Wide crack and flake with moss and wetness in the cracks.","protection":"Medium to small gear despite the size of the crack and flake","location":"Wide crack next to Bard"},"__v":0},{"_id":"OHzasSx5V++aeS14ZTD5TQ==","name":"Orcrist","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Paul Muehl, Pete Delannoy, and Eric Janoscrat, July 26, 1983","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.57106,43.84867]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"110594827","mp_crag_id":"106538500","climb_id":"OHzasSx5V++aeS14ZTD5TQ==","areaRef":"tlCcYAAKWzCDKamo7FjzhQ=="},"content":{"description":"Very long crack system in the middle of the gully.

Totally worth the approach. Located on the way to the \"Adventure's of Bill-Bolting Baggins\"... \n\n  There are several classics on this same formation that will provide a days worth of climbing in the spicy but safe 5.7 to 5.10 range.  \n\n  Climb the bolted groove until it becomes possible to jam up under Smaug's Left Wing. \n\n  Setting a belay at the top of the notch is possible. A short distance around the corner is a set of bolted anchors located on the south side of the formation to belay from. \n\n  The summit of the Dragon's Head can be climbed from the notch belay stance. Follow a rising diagonal counter-clockwise starting on the north side of the Dragon's Head. \n\n  There currently are no fixed anchors at the Dragon's Head summit. Be prepared to down lead back to the notch. A great little 5.7 summit. \n\n  Protection is possible on the way up. Some longer slings are useful to set a tope rope for those who aren't up to down lead from the Dragon's Head. \n\n  If you don't mind walking a short distance back around to the north face you, can safely rappel from the south side anchors with one 60 meter rope. \n\n  It is possible to climb a little higher and belay at a set of bolted anchors in a smaller notch on the east/left side of the groove. Two ropes are required to rappel back down the route from these anchors.","protection":"Modern Bolts & a set of 1/2\" to 4\"+ cams, one set of stoppers, q.d.s & over the shoulder slings, Bolted Anchors","location":"This route is located on the north face of the Far Downs.
