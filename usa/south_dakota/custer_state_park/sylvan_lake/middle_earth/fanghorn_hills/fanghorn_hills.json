You'll see Goldberry Lane on Ered Lithui on the left at the top of the hill. Quickbeam is on the right, just before you crest the hill. There's a large boulder (rock fin) in the middle at the crest to confuse you a bit. Use your alpine route finding skills :-) I used John Pages green book (\"Recommened Climbs...\") for the approach. \n\n  Crux is getting to the first bolt and maybe a move past it. After 1st bolt, I climbed a bit right before angling left to 2nd bolt. Follow your nose to the 3rd. Then you'll wonder where the 4th is until you step up a bit. Don't worry about the run to the top because there's a crack a bit up from the last bolt and a great horn up and right of that. \n\n  Enjoy!","protection":"4 bolts, the 4th is difficult to see until you move past the 3rd. It's a ways from the 4th bolt to the top but there's a good webbing sling (not a cord sling, too thick) around a horn about 10 feet from the top. If I would have brought gear, I believe I could have gotten in a tcu or 1/2 tech friend in between 4th bolt and sling.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"e1qz+x8WUaObWWWwIAV6Yw==","name":"Enting","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.57021,43.84842]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105714896","mp_crag_id":"105714390","climb_id":"e1qz+x8WUaObWWWwIAV6Yw==","areaRef":"HU9lo91hXdy0q+n11D/GQw=="},"content":{"description":"Climb a nice thin crack left of Quickbeam on the same spire.
