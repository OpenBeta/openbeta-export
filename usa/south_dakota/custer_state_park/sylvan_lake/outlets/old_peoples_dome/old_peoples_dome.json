Basically, go down the same trail that leads to the back side of Outer Outlet and the Conn Diagonal climb but then turn to the left and continue downhill on a well worn trail that leads to a tall dome shaped spire. The climb is just left of the two small white birch trees. The first bolt is about 20 feet off of the deck, but it can be easily approached from the adjacent ugly gully. I highly recommend the direct ascent. The route is also fairly run outt near the top, but there is a horizontal crack that takes a #1 tricam or small cam. After the last bolt, follow the unprotected arete or slide around to the right and go up last protected part of Aging Gracefully to the intermediate bolt/chain anchor. If you choose the second option, you need to place a double sling on the last bolt of Creeping Senility and a single sling on the last button bolt for Aging Gracefully to avoid monster rope drag. The approximately 175 foot high summit can be reached with a 60 M rope with about 3 M to spare, otherwise with a shorter rope you can make it a two pitch climb. It's an easy unprotected scramble from the intermediate belay up to a large ledge and on up to the true summit, where a new bolt anchor has been provided. Two ropes are needed for rap from either anchor.","protection":"Seven or eight bolts with runout in the middle and near the top of the climb.

Getting to the first bolt is probably the crux. Another trouble spot is having to stretch to the right to reach a foothold below the 5th bolt. I found that clipping this bolt pulls your second to the right off of the more comfortable holds to the left. Apparently there is a horn that can be slung above this point so it may be better to skip the 5th bolt? The anchors are the same for Creeping Senility but on this climb you have a bolt just below the anchors unlike on Creeping Senility, which is unprotected on top of the arete.

All three climbs also go to the same intermediate bolt/chain anchor below the true summit.
