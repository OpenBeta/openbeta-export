Some great climbing is packed into a short distance. \n\n  Start near large boulder and climb 15' to a small bulge. Place micro cams or small stoppers to protect the crux bulge, then follow knobby face 15' to a small, sloping ledge and a solid fixed pin. From pin, climb to summit on solid crystals with no pro. The finish is easy and a good way to get your head straight for harder routes.
