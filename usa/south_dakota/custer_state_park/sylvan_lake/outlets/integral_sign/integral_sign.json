Located on the S side, stem up the unique integral sign that cuts the center of the formation. Establish on to the right wall and make a couple moves before protection is available. A fall before gear is placed would result in a 15' drop to a slab then a further 25'-ish of tumbling. Continue up hand crack over a bulge to a nice low angle ramp. Build a nest of gear and punch it straight up the crystal face to the safety of the next crack. This cracks leads to the summit.
