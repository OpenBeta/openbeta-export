Start on the diagonaling finger crack which leads to fun and committing face climbing through two bolts. The crack gobbles up gear and has one \"interesting section\" right before the rest and first bolt. Continue face climbing up and slightly left while getting small gear in diagonal and horizontal cracks. The holds on the wall are sculpted sloper pods and at times can feel insecure. Have a good head and cruise flawlessly through to the next bolt. Above This place a red Camalot and fire off the easy 50ft run out left side of arÃªte to the top.","protection":"Standard rack.

Climbs the crack up to the flake. Place a stopper and move straight up and around the flake to gain the low angle chimney. Don't be fooled by this \"easy Chimney\" its fun 5.6-5.7 that makes ya think in a few spots. Exposure is great and the views half way up the Chimney are good enough to jump on this climb. The chimney gobbles gear good. The last part of the climb is a nice step out onto the flake and is about a 5.7-5.8 move with beautiful exposure. Great belay at top. Take a moment to take a seat at one of the best natural benches in around Sylvan with great views of Vertigo. Downclimb is on the back.
