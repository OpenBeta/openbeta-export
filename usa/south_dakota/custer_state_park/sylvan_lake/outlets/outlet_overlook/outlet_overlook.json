Either a early morning warm up or a late night pump. Work the small crack through the bulge throw a fist in. After all this is just another roadside acracktion. If only this thing was a few feet higher it would be a great route. Fun and short with great gear placement and hand jams. Starts in crack and works through the Crux bulge some say this is 5.8. Depends on your reach. Simple yet fun a good warm up or a fun first lead.\n\n This is the small little spire that looks like the top could slide off. ( It won't.) Directly to the south a few feet from the Sylvan Lake Lodge Maintenance shed. It is the only climbable rock opposite side of the road from Noras Wall and Middle Earth Overlook.
