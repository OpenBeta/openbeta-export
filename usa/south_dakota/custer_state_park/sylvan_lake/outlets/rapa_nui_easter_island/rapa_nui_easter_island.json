The only thing this climb is missing is a long easy runout to put the cherry on top. Scramble up easy 3rd class on the lakeside of the formation near a fallen tree to a possible belay ledge and the base of the climb. Around the Corner at the fins low point Start up the fin/arete and follow the bolt line just left of the arÃªte to the top From the first moves to the last it just keeps giving thin holds. The top gets tricky. Expect small sharp holds and good smearing. (Beta) Don't get suckered in to going too far left. This route is taller than the pictures show. The bolts are right where you need them not so much where you WANT them.
