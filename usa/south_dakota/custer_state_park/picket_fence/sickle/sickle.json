It would be beneficial to bring two cordolettes that are a little longer to sling the nice natural protection.  There are also a couple places where a  cam or nut could be placed as well. \n\n  A very nice set of anchors are at the top of the route just below the summit.  There is also a bolt that the Conn's put up in the late 50's /early 60's which is loose, tiny and not very confidence inspiring.","location":"The route is on the northeast side of the formation and moves up the obvious arete.
