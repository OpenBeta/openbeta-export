May be only 10+, but a full value one at that! Best done as one pitch but be very mindful of rope management, and be prepared to be on the lead for awhile. Gear and rock are excellent. Though some placement opportunities are a little ways apart, it never becomes R rated. Just exciting!\n\n Start in right facing off-width to gain the beautiful zig-zagging crack. When crack starts to disappear towards the top, traverse left then up face to link a couple more cracks.","protection":"Extra micro cams   Doubles up to 3\"   Nuts and RP's   Runners   Bolted anchors with webbing and two quicklinks.","location":"Obvious zig-zag crack that faces the Cathedrals.
