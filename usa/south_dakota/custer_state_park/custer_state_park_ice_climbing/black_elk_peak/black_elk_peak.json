Although the the mountain is not in Custer State park but rather the Black Elk WIlderness which borders Custer State Park. There is one known climb as of now on the mountain \" Black Elks Tear\". It is a very obvious feature you can see from a far. It is likely the \"best\" ice to climb in the southern hills. Usually the ice is pretty fat and is a great length compared to many of the smaller flows around the Hills."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:16.668Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:33.217Z"}
