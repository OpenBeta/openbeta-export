In the transition between, I was eating raspberries growing from a plant on the wall to the right... reaching for them added a crux.   Climb up the very north end of the East Face and pass a bulge with what appears to be an undercling (but is actually rotten rock) and up better stone near the arete. Continue to the arete and to the inside, between the spire and the wall behind it on good square holds. Reach the knife-blade arete, now to your left and climb runout to the summit. This final bit was worn as if it had seen some prior traffic, yet a few folks walking by with the Piana book could not identify it.  Can you help?
