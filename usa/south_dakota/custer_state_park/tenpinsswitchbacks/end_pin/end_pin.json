It requires great faith in the friction here.   Climb up the East Face cracks past a bit of gear and a pin, reaching a bolt. Get into a good stance and figure your way past a bulge just below a second bolt, you may or may not decide to place a micro-cam in a little constriction below a slick fingerlock entering the crux. I placed it. My partner did not. Then again, I caught a few hefty falls due to that too... I think it would hold a fall.  Anyway, it is a little in the way of the climbing.  COmplete the crux, reach over and clip the second bolt, then proceed on pretty good holds and easier moves (5.8+?) to the top, but probably pumped.","protection":"A few small cams and nuts plus 2 bolts.","location":"On the East Face of the End Pin, staring you in the face as you look at the End Pin formation."},"__v":0},{"_id":"MgrNr/ayUtuKIV0XxI2kKQ==","name":"End Game","yds":"5.11+","grades":{"yds":"5.11+","french":"7a"},"fa":"Todd Skinner, Paul Piana, Pete DeLannoy, Brett Cochran","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.53626,43.83973]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119559676","mp_crag_id":"105845960","climb_id":"MgrNr/ayUtuKIV0XxI2kKQ==","areaRef":"3k8OBHMfW9muQ8mewjF6mw=="},"content":{"description":"Another of many classic difficult Skinner/ Piana lines, and Paul & Todd's last first ascent together in the hills. Clip a good looking piton and make thuggy and fun moves complete with slopers and lay backing until the thin crux at bolt two. Pull the nothing crimps and relax as the route eases up until the summit. At bolt four either go straight up following clean holds or bail right to some dirty knobs for a slightly easier finish.
