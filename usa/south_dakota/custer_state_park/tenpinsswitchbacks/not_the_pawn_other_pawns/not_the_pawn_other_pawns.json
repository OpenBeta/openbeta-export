It is dead vertical so all falls would be short and clean. There isn't a very distinct crux, it's just very consistent hard 10 move after another. Very pinchy with ok feet. i felt like I was going to blow a finger tendon while holding on so tight because i thought my feet were just melting off the rock. I've been told this was bolted from the ground up using free stances, great style if you ask me. Get on it.","protection":"5 bolts. Three bot anchor up top. Easy access to the top from the rear if you wanna set up a TR, use extra long slings to reduce rope drag.","location":"Located near the Pawn. Look for a short blunt spire with a crystalline face and 5 bolts, can't miss it. Best to walk off b/c of the location and type of bolts up top."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,eb71723c-d454-5686-9f66-8bbd19c7143e,68deff18-0cec-54ad-bd51-199e9e408017,fa07dfd3-d2cb-5ded-a742-65b7411f4c4d","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Custer State Park","Tenpins/Switchbacks","Not the Pawn (Other Pawns)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.5358,43.8394]},"bbox":[-103.5364234161862,43.838950339818126,-103.53517658381381,43.83984966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108281820","area_id":"+gff09LLXe2nQmW3QR9MTQ=="},"content":{"description":"This formation is located near the Pawn (which holds Patience 8X).
