Climb the obvious wide crack.  At the end of the crack, traverse right around to the other side of the spire.  This is easy at first then more difficult (use the force if necessary--it worked for me).  The route finishes up a short but unprotected face. \n\n  Be mindful of the way your rope is running.  You'll need to place a long runner when you least want to. \n\n  A one rope rappel will get you back to the ground.","protection":"Medium to large cams for the beginning and smaller pieces for the traverse.
