Pass one more bolt to gain a small ledge. At this point you can place an optional #1 BD. Continue up angling right on easier terrain, then move up and left to a small \"pedestal\". Getting your feet on this is slightly cruxy (there is a crappy small cam placement to help get the next bolt clipped from the pedestal). From this point the climbing gets harder and somewhat sequential but if you have clipped the bolt from the pedastal it is very well protected. Climb past the well protected crux to the anchors. This route can also be toproped. Access by going around the mass to the left. A couple approx. 5.6 moves gain you access to the anchors. Bolted ground up with hand drills using hooks and cams as needed.","protection":"Bolts, chain anchors.
