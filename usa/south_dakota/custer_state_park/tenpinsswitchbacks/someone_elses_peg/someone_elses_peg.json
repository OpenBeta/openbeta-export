After climbing for about 25 feet you traverse to the left over a bulge and do a short traverse.  This is a bit scary as there aren't too many gear options.  Head up again after about 10 feet with good gear placements behind a flake.  The crux for me was the face climbing which starts at about half way up the climb on top of the flakes.","protection":"The bottom half takes bomber nuts, cams, and I placed a hex as well.  The top half is bolted.  Bring a lot of slings with biners for the bottom and at least 8 draws for the top bolted section.","location":"The route is located on the northeast corner of the formation in an obvious dihedral.  You can climb this or the nice crack on the face.  Two ropes will be needed to get down to your starting point.  You may want to bring webbing to replace the anchor.  It was ok as of 11/07/07, but usually gets brittle quickly."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,eb71723c-d454-5686-9f66-8bbd19c7143e,68deff18-0cec-54ad-bd51-199e9e408017,5ecd6122-fcf9-5dbe-9227-624a337004db","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Custer State Park","Tenpins/Switchbacks","Someone Else's Peg"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.5358,43.8394]},"bbox":[-103.5364234161862,43.838950339818126,-103.53517658381381,43.83984966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106057733","area_id":"Xs1hIvz5Xb6SJ2JKM3AE2w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.5364234161862,43.838950339818126],[-103.53517658381381,43.838950339818126],[-103.53517658381381,43.83984966018186],[-103.5364234161862,43.83984966018186],[-103.5364234161862,43.838950339818126]]]}},"content":{"description":"Great rock in the Ten Pins.
