They originally had no intention of climbing it due to the fact that you can just walk off the back. The day before they had set pre-placed pitons to move things along. After a couple of pitches up the Conns gained a obvious ledge in which became known as, \" The Balloon Ledge\" because the Conns intended to float balloons off so that the reports could see their position. The 30 foot crux of the climb comes directly above this ledge. Huge route with great exposure. Like any Conn route its an adventure and takes good route finding skills. I found myself off route at times. The route ascends the Nose of Little Devils Tower. Climb up gully systems to gain the Balloon Ledge. Short face crux pitch leads to more gully systems above the ledge. Easier ledges and gullies lead to the summit. Summit pitch should end around the old spruce tree atop. There route for the most part has been lost. Try to follow up what information has been given. As stated before I got way off route.

A rack is plenty from past experience on this wall.","location":"The Northface of Little Devils Tower.  Huge Obvious face across from Harney Peak.
