LightSaber is the premier gear route in this little corner of the galaxy. And while it is more fun than blowing up the Death Star without using a guidance system, it is not a route for those who think their fear might make them succum to the Dark Side.  \n\n  Starts with an unprotectable boulder problem which puts you up against a crack that is hard to navigate and even harder to read as far as gear placement goes. The crack leads to a tricky pod/roof pull that brings you just within reach of two bolts which offer very little New Hope for those who are not comfortable with Needle's style runouts.  \n\n  A few Jedi Masters might insist that this route is everything the Needle's offers in a miniature package and Padwans need not apply.
