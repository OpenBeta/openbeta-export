Climb up and left on good gear to a small roof. Hand traverse under the roof for a wild exit into the finger crack. Follow the finger crack past a tree to a nice belay ledge. This pitch is covered in moss and lichen but is surprisingly fun! \n\n  P2: (5.8, 80) Climb the clean finger crack as it slowly widens to hands. If this pitch was anywhere near a road, it would be an all-time classic! \n\n  Descent: From the summit, scramble down to a minor summit with webbing.
