A BD #4 and #5 are really useful.  The 5 is probably more useful.  Sling the summit for an anchor.  Rappel was done as two Needles Style Rappels.  One 80 m rope MIGHT make it as a NSR off the top.  It was a hard call.","location":"Easy to identify - the deep offwidth splitting the two spires is an obvious landmark.\n\n This route was named as our friend and visiting climber from Boulder felt that after all these sketchy Needles antics, he'd be happy to go home, clean his house, and be domestic for a little bit.  A satisfying adventure."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,4122cbe4-c7e6-5f19-9fb8-2ccb790823d6,c1a410df-c728-50ce-814e-0407c27dd9ab,b0091929-4fd4-5062-b331-b1d772f44a5d","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Grizzly Bear Creek","North Fork Area","Domesticaters, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.51482,43.8656]},"bbox":[-103.51544369012382,43.86515033981814,-103.51419630987616,43.86604966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119068459","area_id":"sAkZKU/UUGKzMbHXcvRKXQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.51544369012382,43.86515033981814],[-103.51419630987616,43.86515033981814],[-103.51419630987616,43.86604966018187],[-103.51544369012382,43.86604966018187],[-103.51544369012382,43.86515033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This pair of spires (East & West Domesticaters) sits high up on a ridge top above the North Fork."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:19.022Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:25.661Z"}
