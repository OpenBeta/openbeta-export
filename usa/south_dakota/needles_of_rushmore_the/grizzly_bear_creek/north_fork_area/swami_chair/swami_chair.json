It can be identified pretty easily from the North Fork bottom as it is quite tall and has a very long low-angle slab running up to a distinct summit block (a spire that might have inspired the name Blockhead if there weren't already several in the Hills.) \n\n  IMPORTANT: A cairn was found on the summit.  Given that there are several easy lines and that we probably didn't even take the easiest, it is quite possible this summit has another name.  If you have climbed this, please message me and we will update the spire appropriately.  While a couple of Horning routes and Conn routes in the area have not yet been identified/confirmed, it is unlikely to be these spires.  The Horning routes nearby are listed as 5.8 and 5.9.  The area's missing Conn route, the Booby Prize, has little information.  It was climbed by the Conns as a consolation after an attempt on the Ball Bearing.  It is described as a 'neighbor' of the Ball Bearing but the hike between what we have called Swami Chair and Ball Bearing is, I think, a bit too long to match this description.  No register or other clues were found on the summit."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:19.022Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:25.327Z"}
