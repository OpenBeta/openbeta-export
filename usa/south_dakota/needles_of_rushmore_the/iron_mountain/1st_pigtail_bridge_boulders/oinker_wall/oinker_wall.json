I guess it depends on if you like cracks or holds. The original FA was done by sit-starting with legs in the hole, grabbing the inside rail to start, and jamming your way to the top-out utilizing some interesting face techniques along the way. Alternatively, you can start with legs to the side and hands on the rail, going into a layback technique through the steep arete until the bomber hand jam can be reached.
