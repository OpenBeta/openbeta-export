Or also good if you are new to offwidth and wanting to test the waters. Start on climbers right with the low ledge and traverse-jam your way to gain a left arm chicken-wing. Then wiggle your way left side in up the offwidth until you can gain the solid hand jams near the top. Top-out and scramble down the opposite side. I have seen this route done by compressing both sides of the arete until either the hand jams or top ledge is reached. Either way, the grade is relatively consistent.","protection":"Two pads and a spotter","location":"As you approach The Butcher Shop from the direction of The Hog Wall you will see an obscure hole created by two leaning boulders with a dead log in front of the entrance.

Such an awesomely unique problem for this area! For those of you that don't climb OW, do not lose hope, there are many good face holds throughout the climb. For those of you that dabble in the art of OW, you're in for a real treat! This problem would be a hard on-sight for the grade. The holds and jams are particular, requiring picky sequencing to feel secure. Four-star route for it's uniqueness and technique. The only thing that bumps it to three-stars in my mind is it's need for further clean-up, but that's where time and bodies come into play.Start at the narrow obscure opening and burrow through the 8ft tunnel using patience and precision. As you near the end of the tunnel find your holds and nail that invert baby!! For the last 8ft of crack, use your body type and climbing style to fuel your beta generator (there are a couple options here height dependent). Top out the crack and scramble back down towards the sit-start.","protection":"2 large and 1 thin bouldering pads and a spotter.","location":"As you come uphill by way of The Hog Wall look for an obscure hole created by two leaning boulders just over top the hill.
