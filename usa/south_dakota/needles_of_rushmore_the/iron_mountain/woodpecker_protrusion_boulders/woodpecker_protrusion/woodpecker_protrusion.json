The original crack line was good however Luke Ross had an \"Awakening \" and saw the direct finish- truly making it a Black Hills Classic ! I had pleasure of helping him bolt this amazing line.   Two bolts lead to a slightly overhanging hand crack- having 3 #3 cammalots is the ideal rack but you can get by with 2 and double #2's- singles on the rest- slinging your gear is helpful for rope drag. The crack narrows to fingers then bolts on the face head wall. Save a medium piece in between last bolt and anchors. Many different cruxes will test all of your climbing skills-","protection":"6 bolts, stoppers, .3 -#3 Cammalot - extra # 3's helpfull   2 bolt Anchor at top   A 70 meter rope will just barely get you down- WATCH your ends!!","location":"From parking spot follow trail west- turn right -N-and go down the hill just before the sledgehammer- you will pass Knife in a Gunfight-on your left -as you walk down hill Rain Shadow Boulder will be on your right- continue around the Boulder heading east now you can't miss this Amazing Splitter!!"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,862d90b2-4205-52e8-84ee-eb63dba710f5,8911653f-06be-5b29-9f7e-be099543121e,f71b8f07-b42d-5c51-b5ee-f75dbdf27de8","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Iron Mountain","WoodPecker Protrusion Boulders","Woodpecker Protrusion"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"V0+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.4317,43.8731]},"bbox":[-103.43232376860944,43.87265033981815,-103.43107623139055,43.87354966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107981053","area_id":"9xuPB7QtXFG17vddvfJ96A=="},"content":{"description":"Obvious Protrusion up the hill from parking."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:17.118Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:34.146Z"}
