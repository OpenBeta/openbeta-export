There is one established problem and one very hard futuristic project that probably is one of the hardest in the Hills. It could probably go from some crazy strong mutant climber. I have done some moves starting from the chalked crimps above your head to the left when viewing. Out right almost making it to the lip. Its very powerful! The low start into this is going to take a lot. The feet are there and it's just figuring out one/two hand holds that don't exist to connect the lower portion into the upper portion. I believe this line will be a classic proud line if it ever gets complete. Hirsch? Ross?
