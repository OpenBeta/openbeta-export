I was shown this line years ago by Brent. He told me it was one of the last great projects of this area. From the time I saw it I was impressed and spent many hours, days, months, and years figuring out this line. When looking at it one may think this is a easy line. Once you get on it, it stays on you until the very top Crux comes leaving the crack and bumping up onto a committing crimp high on the face. I had given up on this project until i went out with some friends and found new beta to make it do-able. I originally thought this problem to be in the upper 7/-8 range. Climb it and see what you think.","protection":"couple of crash pads and a spotter is a must.","location":"Very obvious problem on the west face of the boulder.
