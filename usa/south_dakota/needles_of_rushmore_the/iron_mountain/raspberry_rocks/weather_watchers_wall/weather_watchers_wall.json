Climb up this crack until near the end. Climb out left to the face on jugs and up to the anchors for pitch one. For pitch two head up and shoot for the gap in the roof above. Enter the cave and walk to the back. Chimney up through the cave to the top. The anchors are to the left as your facing the wall or to the north. The climb can be done in one pitch with lots of rope drag as both pitches wander a bit. The climbing is very easy at the top so it isn't a huge problem.","protection":"Standard rack. Fixed bolted anchors for the belays. Number 2 and 3 cams for the hand/fist crack. Lots of slings to sling natural pro and to avoid rope drag.","location":"The route is a large right facing corner between the bolt lines for Rocking Raspberries and Awk-Weird Raspberries. Start to the right of Awk-Weird Raspberries and climb above and to the left to gain the corner. The first belay is at the anchors for Rocking Raspberries. To descend do a two rope rap from the second pitch anchors."},"__v":0},{"_id":"1CBw5Z9PUy6II1Qp7zZhqA==","name":"Bad Apples and Raspberries","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Brent Kertzman and Monte Carlson","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.40947,43.83905]},"left_right_index":13,"mp_id":"105715298","mp_crag_id":"105714537","climb_id":"1CBw5Z9PUy6II1Qp7zZhqA==","areaRef":"DJ8FLQBMUZmmcUZD5FMC4A=="},"content":{"description":"This route follows a leftward trending (doglegged) finger crack in a corner just left of \"Middle of the Road\".

The route consists of difficult liebacking plus offers iron cross type movement.  Move left a bit at the fourth bolt for the 5.11 variation which is the more popular version on this route.  There is a direct variation that can be climbed between the fourth and fifth bolts and checks in around 5.12a/b.  Unfortunatly the crux foothold on the direct seems to get smaller every year.  The direct version was the way the first ascentionist originally redpointed the route.  The finishing moves will keep your attention.

It faces west/northwest. There is a substantial boulder field below this wall. Near the center of this wall is a giant tiered overhang. This wall is home to the majority of the routes at Raspberry Rocks. This is one of the steepest and longest walls we have in the Black Hills. There are a number of corners, aretes, cracks and overhangs on this wall. There are no other cliffs in the Black Hills that are so symmetrically cleaved. This area is similar to Index Town Walls in Washington State or many of the crags in Boulder Canyon, Colorado. Most routes have fixed anchors for rappel purposes. This cliff is in the shade in the morning and gets sunshine after 2:00PM during the summer. Several routes not to be missed are Rocking Raspberries 5.9, Somewhere East of Fresno 5.10c, Indian Summer 5.10c, Frosted Red Raspberry Pop Tarts 5.10d, Left Face of Eve 5.11b and The Horn Route 5.10b."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:18.370Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:24.239Z"}
