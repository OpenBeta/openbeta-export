Broken into 2 pitches to eliminate the chance of rope drag. If diligent could get away going this thing in one monster pitch! \n\n  Pitch 1 (5.10+): Start by tackling the crux right off the ground by passing two bolts to gain the crack about 20 ft up. Starting off with fingers and quickly turns from hands to off-width. Continue up and left to a bolted webbing anchor.  \n\n  Pitch 2 (5.7): From the belay ledge trend right and up the chimney/fist crack. Bolted webbing anchor. Either rappel the route right away or I recommend summitting the formation by scrambling up 5.fun to a great view of Black Elk Wilderness. \n\n  Descent: Make two rappels down the route.  Single 70m is plenty.","protection":"#.5-#4, Doubles #1-#4, Nuts, Draws   Bolted Anchors \n\n  Optional #5- can get away with large hexes","location":"As you approach the wall.
