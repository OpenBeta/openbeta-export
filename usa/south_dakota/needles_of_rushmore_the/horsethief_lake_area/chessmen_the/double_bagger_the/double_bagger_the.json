The route actually traverses in above the roof from the left side.  There is a little bit of gear.  The crux of the entire route is rounding the corner to gain the main face above the roof.  Thin 5.10 climbing with small gear and very small licheny and slippery feet.  After this, work your way up, trending toward the left side of the spire, placing more tiny tiny gear in a horizontal or two, before reaching a large ledge with a separate summit block.  To gain the block, you can you stay on the SE face, although the move is steep and intimidating.  There is a very hollow flake which you should not place gear behind.  Instead, there is a fixed pin in a horizontal above the flake on the upper summit block.  Clip this and make your final big move to the top.  A bit heady but not too hard!","protection":"Bring your smallest gear, especially brass nuts and small ball nuts, up to a .75 BD camalot.  A few pieces a little larger than this can assist with the anchor on the top.
