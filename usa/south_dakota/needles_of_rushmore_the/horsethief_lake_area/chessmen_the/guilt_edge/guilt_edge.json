Starts in your face with a small bulge to a dead vertical crimper section.  After two bolts, proceed to a short vertical finger crack which takes gear.  Continue above this on techy 5.9 past one more bolt and a very small tricky gear placement in a horizontal pod.  Easier terrain leads to your last piece in a mid sized horizontal which you use to traverse about 10 feet right to a band of crystals you can use to gain the summit. \n\n  As you might guess, the route was done ground up by two hookers covered in glitter.","protection":"3 bolts and a rack of your smallest pieces up to a .75 or 1 BD camalot.  Bolted anchor at the top currently set up with cord but no rap biner.","location":"The route begins on the west face.  Look for the two bolts down low.  By the end of the route, you will have traversed onto the south/southwest face,   which faces North Needle.  Single rope rap of at least 60m will get you down.
