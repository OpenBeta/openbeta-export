But don't worry about the munge, it clears up and the rock gets cleaner pretty quick. After a few hard sidepull moves grab a jug and place a few small cams and nuts, get your feet up and gain a good stance on a juggy rail for some more small nut and cam placements and huck for another jug. Gain a lawn chair of a rest and gain a small crack in the granite for a decent large nut placement before the first bolt. \n\n  After that, start dancing and prancing your way up some really good 5.8 crimps and small holds on less than vertical rock that is absolutely bomber. Climb past two more bolts and get ready for the mental crux. After the pounding in the third and final bolt, Chris came to the conclusion that he could float like a helium balloon up 60 feet of suburb 5.7 jugs. \n\n  Gain a crack below a pudly bulge and toss in a hand sized cam before crawling up the last ten feet to the summit. If you had an orgasm after sending Four Little Fishies in Custer State Park this route might be right up your alley.","protection":"Bring an assortment of C3's, small cams, small nuts, a big nut and three quickdraws. After the third bolt your best protection is not to fall until a seam at the top takes a fist sized cam. Needles style repel and a walk off through a gully  is required. This route might be equipped with more bolts and a proper anchor in the future upon request...but until then sack up and go for an adventure.","location":"To the right of Black Elk's Cry."},"__v":0},{"_id":"5IS+0jdqVJKXvjtdr6Swbw==","name":"Black Elk's Cry","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Andy Busse and Toby Brusseau: 2010 (Ground Up)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.50288,43.88045]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"111918902","mp_crag_id":"111918899","climb_id":"5IS+0jdqVJKXvjtdr6Swbw==","areaRef":"Ve5QbUotXFe0u9o4SNzcBA=="},"content":{"description":"Climb an overhanging face left of a schist alcove and gain a crack that will make you cry out with pleasure and pain.","protection":"Purple C3 - #3 along with a rack of nuts with an emphasis on micronuts.","location":"North 43.880330 by West 103.503035.
