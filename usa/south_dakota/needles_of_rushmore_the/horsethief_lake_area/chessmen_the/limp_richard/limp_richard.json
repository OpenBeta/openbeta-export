It has two cruxes - entering the offwidth and a pinch point as you exit the offwidth into face climbing with a finger crack for protection.","protection":"Bring at least a couple fours and fives.  This route would be hard to walk cams up on because it widens out to a chimney in the middle.  Bring a few finger size pieces for the top.  Having a couple hand sized pieces is also nice.  You can easily use the bolted anchor for Stiff Richard.","location":"The route is pretty obvious.  When looking at Limp Richard's sunny west face, the crack systems from right to left are Limp Richard, Richards Out For Harambe, and then Stiff Richard.

Toss to a hatchet handjam in a crack and begin the off-width struggle with great jams, crimps, and creative foot placements.  \n\n  Exit the crack system.
