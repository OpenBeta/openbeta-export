Jack Torness led the FFA.  The start without a shoulder stand goes at about a V4 boulder problem.","protection":"Bring lots of C3s and small nuts.  If you want to do the route in the style of the FFA, solo the beginning without any gear or a harness.  Then, after passing the crux, wedge yourself into the chimney above and have your friends throw you a harness, rope, and gear.  This way, you will avoid having to use any wide gear at the bottom.   \n\n  Beta Bonus Clue: A number five is a tasty treat at the slab topout. \n\n  Descent is a Needles Style Rappel however you see fit.","location":"Look for the obvious direct crack right behind the Twisted Tree at the base of the spire.
