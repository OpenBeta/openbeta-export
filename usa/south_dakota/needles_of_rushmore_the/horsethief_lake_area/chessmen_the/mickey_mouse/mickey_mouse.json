The free ascent of End Pin was to follow a month later (which has now settled at 10+). \n\n  The route takes a crystal trough protected by three spaced bolts. Bringing supplemental gear is nearly futile. Get the first bolt clipped by stemming off of the boulder then start off the ground. The crux is in the first 10-15'. Sustained 5.9+/10- climbing the rest of the way. \n\n  Excellent rock, bold run-outs, and historical significance make this a backcountry classic!  \n\n  All star drive bolts have been replaced as of 2017.","protection":"3 bolts   no anchors on top","location":"Start on NNE corner of spire.
