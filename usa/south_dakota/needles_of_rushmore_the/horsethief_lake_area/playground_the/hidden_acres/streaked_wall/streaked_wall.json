Starts on what looks like a featureless vertical slab of granite that actually has strangely deceivingly good holds if implored and swiped without anyone noticing. Good sport climbing moves and bolts for quite a few feet until the lying to your face climbing forces you to traverse to the left.  \n\n  The diagonally-grabbed, digit robbing holds come to an abrupt halt under a crack that is too ugly to fully enjoy, yet oddly, enough has some large finger-like, crackish holds that allow for sick laybacking. Unfortunately, this tricky route robs you really good finger crack holds the entire way to the anchors but the climbing is still protected by good gear. Black Diamond C3's, small cams (up to about 0.75 and nuts) get swallowed up by this homely slit while you layback, stem and beg for hidden holds to appear right up until the anchors.  \n\n  The fact that it can be top roped after leading Greetings From the Ground makes this route super fun instead of totally deplorable. However, with that said, an onsight of this climb would be a feather in your cap making it a tasty three star experience.","protection":"A normal rack of nuts and a fistfull of finger-sized cams.
