Climb the terribly awkward bulging flake to wide flake above. Climb this flake to the top and place small gear high in the seam above you. Commit to the face out right and climb the face to an obvious crack out right. Follow the crack to the wide slot above, from the top of the wide slot head right up the wide tube. At the top of the wide tube build an anchor on the large ledge.P2: From the ledge stem up the trough climbing past large chicken heads to another ledge, from this ledge commit to the right side of the green face that takes you below the summit block.
