Solo the easy but grungy and lichen-infested face (there are gear opportunities, but the rock is rotten) to gain the platform. Stem between the boulder and the face to reach the high first bolt. Follow the closely-spaced bolts up the dihedral with a combination of stemming and face-climbing. Rock quality on this thing is a bit suspect, and it is pretty dirty. An alternative start would be to tiptoe on a ledge battling a tree to reach the starting platform. Pretty obscure route that apparently sees little traffic and is barely worth doing-- particularly as there are a couple of really good routes at the same grade (Fintastic and Buddha Boys) right nearby.
