So this beautiful highball committing problem starts sitting on a crimp and moves up and slightly to the right of the middle of the \" X \" in the center face. Undercling/ Pinch the dyke with a high right foot. Left hand goes on a small crimp. Pull up and kneebar and cross your right hand through to a small but good hold above your left hand. Move your right foot over to the lover dyke and bring the left hand off the crimp to a sloper. Adjust and match onto the \"Good-Looking hold\" it is quite the opposite depending on how you get it. Either just throw for the lip from here which is pretty good or you can use a small sharp crimp for an intermediate. Grab the big dome up top and pull over. Slightly Overhanging, Holds right where you need them, Fun start and a scary landing make this a great problem in my opinion. Its really not bad if you have an attentive spotter.
