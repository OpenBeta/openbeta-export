Fun problem to warm up on. Some say V6, other stout V5, you be the judge. More traffic could see 3 stars.\n\n Beta from Mike: This problem is to the right of Dynamometer. Start sitting with hands on obvious crimps. Pull on and heel hook with your left foot, you're right foot kind of dangles or smears the entire problem. Bump to the huge side pull jug with your right hand, then move it up higher for a better holds. Adjust feet and throw for a few different options of crimps. High left heel hook on top of the sidepull jug. Adjust and throw for the awesome \"worm\" dyke. Slowly move right along the traverse and adjust once more and hit the small good incut crimp right at the apex of the overhang. Move feet and throw for the awesome bowling ball sized jug.","protection":"A few crash pads.","location":"Southwest Face"},"__v":0},{"_id":"08ihq2YgUneKBPzVr47b+w==","name":"East Face Warm Up","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.47034,43.88772]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"110103577","mp_crag_id":"110020468","climb_id":"08ihq2YgUneKBPzVr47b+w==","areaRef":"7amGjnaVV5e8XVw0vDpu9Q=="},"content":{"description":"East Face problem working good crystals and holds.
