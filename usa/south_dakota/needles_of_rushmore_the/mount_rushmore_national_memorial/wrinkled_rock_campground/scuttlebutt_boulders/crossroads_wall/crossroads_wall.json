Very unlike anything else we have here in the southern hills.\n\n Tackle the overhanging and leftward trending bulge by starting a boulder problem right off the ground (stick clip the second bolt). Continue on good holds and try to hold back the pump. Fire through a brief hard section to a decent rest before the real crux. Gain an even better rest after the crux then make a final dynamic redpoint crux.","protection":"8? bolts   Bolted anchor","location":"Just past the Scuttlebutt boulders is this South facing wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,3b48a6c3-f8e6-52f5-b57a-35a299fb1b7a,f4d7ec62-e67e-51c5-8374-066fc91f4a39,9323fe83-8c67-5c71-9d56-205978f2ada0,0335963c-c312-5a2f-b3a1-0ab595ab89e0","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Mount Rushmore National Memorial","Wrinkled Rock Campground","Scuttlebutt Boulders","Crossroads Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46901,43.89195]},"bbox":[-103.46963396600438,43.89150033981815,-103.46838603399561,43.892399660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116983293","area_id":"AzWWPMMSWi+zoQq1lauJ4A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.46963396600438,43.89150033981815],[-103.46838603399561,43.89150033981815],[-103.46838603399561,43.892399660181866],[-103.46963396600438,43.892399660181866],[-103.46963396600438,43.89150033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"Very sunny.
