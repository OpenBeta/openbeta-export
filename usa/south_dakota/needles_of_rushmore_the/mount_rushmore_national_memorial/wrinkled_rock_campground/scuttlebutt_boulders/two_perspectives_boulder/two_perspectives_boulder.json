This problem was put up on a tour from Brent Kertzman of the Breezy Point area in 2013. Will post photos once i find them. Not really worth doing but figured i would add it on here just for history. Name comes from Robbie and myself because of the rodent poo getting flung off the top when mantling. Since then it is clean and no poo exists.\\\n\n Possible V1-2 variation: Start in a large dirty (for now) undercut in the bottom left of the face. Hike your feet up and slap for a couple slopers until you gain the gash. Work jugs, slopers, and crimps trending right to the peak of the boulder.
