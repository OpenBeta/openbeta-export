Once to the steepness clip a high bolt off great holds and pull on up passing another bolt and gear to the anchor. good ledge. Great pitch on its own. Gear and 3 bolts \n\n  2) 5.9+ Traverse delicately left up the small ramp using tiny crystals on the face. Follow a couple bolts passing a black knob and a small ledge until under the right side of a roof, place a piece and pull a bulge. Follow the path of weakness to the top being careful of some loose flakes. Belay up your second and then traverse to the W on easy ground to find the slung rap anchor.  Some decent ride potential, but shouldn't be a problem for anyone climbing the 1st pitch.
