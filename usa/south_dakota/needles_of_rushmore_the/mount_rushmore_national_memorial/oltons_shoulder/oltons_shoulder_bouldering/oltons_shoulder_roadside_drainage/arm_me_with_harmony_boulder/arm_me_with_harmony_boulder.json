This problem is in a dead end gulley up hill from where you park at Magna Carta. Hike the trail leaving the parking and trend slightly (left) south to the first drainage. Hike up this for a few feet and you will come to a dead end with a small overhang prow. This is the problem. Start on Crimps and move up into the arete feature.
