This tower is the closest one to Olton's massif. At the SE end of the tower, from the large boulder at the base, climb the crack to the ledge. Step up onto the face aiming for the bolts. Face climb past two horizontal fractures to the anchors at the top. It appears that the start of this climb is the same start as Paper Beats Rock. PBR heads right once above the crack and on to the face to the right or north of this route. This route heads straight up or a bit left using the dikes.","protection":"The crack takes medium to larger stoppers or cams of that size. There are 4 bolts between the crack and the 2016 chain anchors. The two horizontal fractures provide no plausible place for pro. Harder than it looks above the crack. There is a moon dust lichen on the surface currently (2017). Best to rap, or top-rope from the anchor. Â From the NW at the top of the gully nearest to Oculta, you can scramble to the summit class 4/5X. Use Caution.","location":"On SD 244 past the Profile View, park across from Monster in a pullout on the west side of the highway. Hike west up the hill on boot tracks up and right to the old abandoned roadbed. Hike west again to where you can drop down west off the old road. Hike west again and downhill a bit before you level off around some bad downed trees (2016). Hike west staying level around and about trees until directly under the massive Olton's Shoulder looming above. There are less downed trees now and hike west again (straight) through the bottom of the drainage. Walk west straight up and left up the hillside. Aim a little left and watch for a broad tower through the trees. This is the tower, but to get to the top of the boulder at the base of the SE rib, do an end around to the left or SE and then up the gully between Oculta and the next tower to the SW. This tower is hidden and HARD TO LOCATE. Hence it's name. If you wander a bit, enjoy the forest."},"__v":0},{"_id":"qOFZFU2iXd2uFX3XbanQQA==","name":"Paper Beats Rock","yds":"5.8-","grades":{"yds":"5.8-","french":"5b"},"fa":"Mark Rafferty and John Lang Ground up","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46879,43.88132]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"109668038","mp_crag_id":"115311212","climb_id":"qOFZFU2iXd2uFX3XbanQQA==","areaRef":"kj7LzKWrURCHCC7dRzB1ng=="},"content":{"description":"","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,3b48a6c3-f8e6-52f5-b57a-35a299fb1b7a,361dfe22-09ad-5981-a2f0-13f3aa15234f,923ecbcc-a5ab-5110-8708-2edd4730759e","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Mount Rushmore National Memorial","Olton's Shoulder","Hidden Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46879,43.88132]},"bbox":[-103.46941385466462,43.88087033981815,-103.46816614533537,43.88176966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115311212","area_id":"kj7LzKWrURCHCC7dRzB1ng==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.46941385466462,43.88087033981815],[-103.46816614533537,43.88087033981815],[-103.46816614533537,43.88176966018187],[-103.46941385466462,43.88176966018187],[-103.46941385466462,43.88087033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"Enter a description of this area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:15.412Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:52.262Z"}
