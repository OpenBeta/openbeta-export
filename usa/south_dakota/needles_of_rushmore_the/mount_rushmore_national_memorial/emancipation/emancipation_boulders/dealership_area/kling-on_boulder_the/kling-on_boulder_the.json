Your right hand goes on the pinch in the overhang horizontal crack. Right foot smears on the face and left just where ever. Transition weight on to your right foot and bump your right hand up to the crimp on the bulge. Bring your left hand up and undercling / pinch the overhang. High feet brings you to the face. Either go right for the small sharp 2 finger crystal or bump in the dish right below it and then adjust onto the crystal. KEY BETA can make this part go smoothly. Without the beta it can seem really hard. once you have adjusted your right hand on the crystal move feet high and slowly lift up reaching for the top jug hold. A few easy moves gets you on top. Better to just flash this problem the fall isn't too fun.","protection":"2 crash pads and a spotter is helpful.","location":"middle of block"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,3b48a6c3-f8e6-52f5-b57a-35a299fb1b7a,73ab82dc-c5ee-5c83-a1ef-7ab3fbcb5d3a,8ac63232-58ac-5f10-83fc-4ad33e3739eb,97128146-1c1f-5f98-a5d6-bbc7b35b27f2,100cc44f-d99d-57a1-b366-96bf70deff67","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Mount Rushmore National Memorial","Emancipation","Emancipation Boulders","Dealership Area","Kling-On Boulder, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.4615,43.88002]},"bbox":[-103.46212384105247,43.87957033981813,-103.4608761589475,43.880469660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110771285","area_id":"EAzET9mdV6GzZpa/cN7/Zw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.46212384105247,43.87957033981813],[-103.4608761589475,43.87957033981813],[-103.4608761589475,43.880469660181866],[-103.46212384105247,43.880469660181866],[-103.46212384105247,43.87957033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"The Kling-On Boulder is located to the right of Mini Marker.
