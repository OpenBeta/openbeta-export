Belay or continue to the top being mindful of rope drag. The next section is fun face climbing up the dihedral and crystalline crack to the top of a pillar with a bolted anchor way off right. Don't belay here, instead go straight up and yard over the roof to the summit and final anchor.  \n\n  Two options to descend. Rap all the way back to the anchor for the potential first pitch, but be sure to keep the rope out of the roof crack OR make 3 raps straight down The Gambler.  \n\n  The bolts on the first section (or pitch) might be a new advent. Perhaps to avoid the federal closure area...or maybe the chockstone crack itself? Regardless, it's a great route with fun climbing all the way.","protection":"Nuts and supplement with a few less than finger to hand size cams.

You can do this without the gear, but it is a little spicy. \n\n  Pitch 2: 12+   Clip the first bolt and yard up to clip the second before you start to keep you off the ledge if you fall...the moves at the start are hard. Climb the arete/face to the left of ace in the hole. Essentially three boulder problem separated by good rests. 8 bolts on this pitch no gear necessary.\n\n The route is atypical for rushmore, not too much crystal pinching...lots of patina edges and slopers.
