You'll know you're there when you see folks waiting for the route. \n\n  Seriously, it took until my 6th visit to Rushmore before I caught this route with no one on it.  A cool rock graced with an incredible route.  Very popular and deservedly so. \n\n  Gossamer climbs the right side of the fin / arete up to, beside, and over the hole (picture window) in the rock.  The start is a bit of an awkward (yet easy) move up to a block and the start of the fin.  As the ground drops off beneath the climb, it is wise to protect the first moves with a stopper (#10 BD?) or cam. \n\n  Once on the block, layback the fin, and start moving up clipping the bolts.  With each move, the angle of the fin lessens and makes things just a bit easier.  Once at the apex of the rock, you'll find 2 'quick clip' type anchors - slip the rope in & get lowered to the ground.  Because of the nature of the route, it needs to be seconded to be cleaned, and rigging a TR wouldn't really work. \n\n  The climb is rated 5.7 and the moves are 5.7, but has a certain intimidation factor.  A fall for the leader OR second could get a bit messy.  As with so many climbs in the Black Hills, this isn't sport climbing - it is bolt protected climbing.","protection":"4 bolts = 4 draws, probably a nut (or two) for the start.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"yMXj5SnPXIWc2rUVtGvQwg==","name":"Conn Route on Picture Window","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Jan and Herb Conn","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46349,43.88448]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105947089","mp_crag_id":"105714372","climb_id":"yMXj5SnPXIWc2rUVtGvQwg==","areaRef":"ZcIb3zo+XC23WVhkI66eCQ=="},"content":{"description":"The crux is stepping up onto Picture Window.
