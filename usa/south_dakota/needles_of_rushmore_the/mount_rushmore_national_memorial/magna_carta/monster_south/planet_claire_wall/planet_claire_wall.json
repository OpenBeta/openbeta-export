After the roof the climb backs of to 5.9-5.10 climbing.  But until after the fifth bolt the climb is on you with the smallest crimper I've ever felt on a 5.11--and you'll use it to clip!  You don't have to clip off of, but it makes the climb that much more interesting.   \n\n  When I climbed this on 06/10/2003, I broke off THREE holds, and one of them is a crucial left hand after the fourth bolt.  I'm not sure if this bumps the grade up a letter, but it's a smaller hold now (three or four fingers, half pad to two fingers, half pad) at the start of a small sequence to clip the fifth bolt. \n\n  Despite the sometimes unreliable nature of this rock, \"Planet Claire\" is worth doing any time you are in the Monster/Marker Area, in my opinion.","protection":"There are eight bolts on \"Planet Claire\" and two rusty chain anchors on top.
