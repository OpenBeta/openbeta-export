It is an excellent somewhat unique slab climb on generally bomber stone with very interesting holds. Climb dishes and sloping crimps up a sustained 5.10 slab to a high weird crux sequence about 10 feet below the chains. Really memorable good climb marred only by a bit of a mungy start and the sheer cussed awkwardness of the crux move. Well worth the hike in to get on this one.","protection":"Bolts— 8 of them.
