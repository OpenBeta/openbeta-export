It is super classic and close to the parking making it a Must for any boulderer. SDS on small but good holds. Pull up and get established with your feet. Your hands get nice holds in the horizontal crack. High right foot to a little crystal indent. Find your balance and throw a high reach and slap the top. This is the hardest part of the climb its a nothing-less slap. If you do make the slap throw your left hand up and do an interesting mantle. Top 10 routes in the Baldy Vicinity.

The best being right foot on a good hold right hand underling and left in the sloper pod up and slightly left. ( HARD) 2.)The other is the SDS makes this probably Solid V8 / V8+ . Start low with right hand where your foot would go for a stand. Left hand on crimp formed by horizontal seam under bulge. Heel hook where your right hand is. Pull up and cross your left hand throw to the small crimp above. Reposition heel hooking foot and push up on it. Bump right hand to a MICRO ( Barley anything there) crystal. Throw right hand to first pod sloper. Left goes to the horizontal seam mid way up for a rest. CRUX TIME: Left hand goes to what appears to be a great sloper pod. :) Laugh it off once you grab this but be careful because hidden in the good looking sloper pod is 3-4 micro seraded crystals waiting to end any and all attempts. If you can manage the pain and strength bump left hand out to a crimp. Adjust feet and throw for the top lip.
