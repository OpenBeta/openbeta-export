Walk around the slabby part of the boulder to the south (closest to the Hueco boulder) and you'll find an overhanging scoop. This problem ascends the left side of the scoop. Start on decent slopers and make a hard move up into an undercling. Stand tall and get some bad slopers on the rounded top of the boulder. Slap around and find the best ones, fight to get your feet up and top out.
