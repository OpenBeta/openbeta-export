Grab with your right hand a decent pocket and stabalize with your left hand on a small crack. Stand up with your left foot until you can reach higher with your left hand. You'll pretty much have to reach to the top with your left.

It climbs the gently overhanging black face on the north side of the boulder, requiring tenacity and intricate footwork more than brute strength. Start standing with your left hand high on a good edge and your right hand about waist high on a good edge. High step your right foot and head up. I don't want to give too much away, half the fun of this problem is figuring out the correct sequence.

The crux move is right in the middle involving a hard move falling into a left hand sidepull, but getting there seems ridiculous and leaving that spot is only slightly easier. After reaching the slot near at the top, move slightly right to top out on the Seul Avec-side on slopey dishes. This problems climbs as well as it looks.
