A modest grade for a route that when first looked at will \"Seam Easy\" (hence the name), but will quickly prove otherwise. Apparently first done as a sit start, this problem starts on abnormal crystals and climbs the thin seam to the top. It's basically a 3 move wonder, the first move is where Greg has his right hand in the photo (a small 3 finger slot), second move is where left hand is in the photo, third move is a lunge with the right hand to the top. Power, but more importantly precision, will go a long way on this great \"V5\" (quotations because 'seams easy' seemed really hard for the given V5).","protection":"Like a lot of the problems at Baldy, this has a good flat landing. 1-2 pads will be plenty.","location":"Go to the lillipad boulder and look at Frogonius, now turn 90 degrees left, walk about 15-20feet, and turn 90 degrees to the left again. You'll be looking at \"Seams Easy\", easily identifiable by an orange face with a black streak and seam and horizontal gash."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,3b48a6c3-f8e6-52f5-b57a-35a299fb1b7a,26caf422-2843-579e-b29a-9200edc8a879,3f89d14b-9f46-5123-8b83-132bebd82fb6,176ae6f9-46f2-5924-9de3-0498965bb9a0","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Mount Rushmore National Memorial","Mount Baldy","Old Baldy Frontside","Seams Easy Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5-6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.4577,43.89]},"bbox":[-103.45832394557529,43.88955033981815,-103.45707605442472,43.89044966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108090523","area_id":"F2rm+UbyWSSd4wSYllu5oA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.45832394557529,43.88955033981815],[-103.45707605442472,43.88955033981815],[-103.45707605442472,43.89044966018187],[-103.45832394557529,43.89044966018187],[-103.45832394557529,43.88955033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"This area contains boulders such as Lillipad, Caddyshack, Sports Action, Slap Happy and so on, although they are listed separately here on mp.com."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:14.332Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:18.883Z"}
