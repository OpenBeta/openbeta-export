It goes straight up the yellow streaked triangular face. It is fairly tall and is not done often. As far as I know, it only has two ascents.Start standing up with your left hand on a tiny, tiny crystal (about the size of a pencil eraser). Stand on a good ledge and pretend to grab something with your right hand. From that position you jump up with your right hand to a decent, small edge. From there it is more crimping, heading toward a good left hand sidepull flake near the top. The landing is slightly slanted but good, but falls from the top are pretty far. So, a good spotter is recommended.","protection":"Pad and an attentive spotter","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,3b48a6c3-f8e6-52f5-b57a-35a299fb1b7a,26caf422-2843-579e-b29a-9200edc8a879,3f89d14b-9f46-5123-8b83-132bebd82fb6,e1b4403d-7e0f-5900-8742-9024f23a1301","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Mount Rushmore National Memorial","Mount Baldy","Old Baldy Frontside","Obtuse Boulder, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V7"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.45702,43.89]},"bbox":[-103.4576439455753,43.88955033981815,-103.45639605442472,43.89044966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105714606","area_id":"4bRAPX4PWQCHQpAk8joTAQ=="},"content":{"description":"This boulder is to the Northeast of the large, prominent spire on the South side of Mt.
