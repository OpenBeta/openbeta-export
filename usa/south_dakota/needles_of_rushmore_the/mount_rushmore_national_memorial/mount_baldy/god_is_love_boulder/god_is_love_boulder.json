Grab two obvious, small crimpers, pull up to another left hand crimp and make a hard move to a slanting, sharp crimp with the right hand. Now, stand up HARD and go right hand again to a good, but akwardly positioned right slanting rail that's up and right. When you do the throw to the rail, your left foot and left hand cut loose and you about barndoor off. The last move makes it worth suffering the painful crimp.
