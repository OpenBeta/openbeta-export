This is a fairly bold lead due to poor rock and the scary traverse finish. Once the last tiny nut/cam is placed in the top of the crack under the roof you need to traverse the ledge 20' out right to the arete. The one spot for gear along the traverse is not that great which is why I think it may deserve an R rating. Although, there is now a bolt to clip just around the arete, from an adjacent route. However by the time you can clip it you don't really need it anyways but it's sure nice!","protection":"Small to Medium","location":"North side in the large dihedral.
