Without they're time and energy I may have always wondered about this great route. They're efforts will open the horizon for climbers of the Black Hills and everyone so lucky that gets to climb on its unique granite structures. \n\n  Scramble up the low angle ramp to gain the first bolt, you will then encounter the crux down low. A well protected sequence (going through 2 more bolts) of crimps and sidepulls will get you to some nice big holds. Use these to pull on and up into a crack/seam. From there climb through three more bolts, each slightly more spaced out than the last. Finally a short runout on easier climbing will lead you to some big jugs and the narrow topout. Very fun route! Great alternative for Boxcar's and Airplanes. Albeit harder, it is better protected and can be easily toproped after it has been lead. ","protection":"Well protected with three bolts within the crux of the climbing and an additional three after that (6 total). 2 bolt anchor with rappel chains.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,3b48a6c3-f8e6-52f5-b57a-35a299fb1b7a,bfd6f4a9-ea72-57b9-921a-e6abf070e56d,2dbe22b0-a63b-5681-b6e6-94d42f9fba51","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Mount Rushmore National Memorial","South Seas","Shark's Tail"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.467,43.8864]},"bbox":[-103.46762390786547,43.88595033981814,-103.46637609213455,43.88684966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107645668","area_id":"Lb4isKY7VoG25pTUL5+6UQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.46762390786547,43.88595033981814],[-103.46637609213455,43.88595033981814],[-103.46637609213455,43.88684966018187],[-103.46762390786547,43.88684966018187],[-103.46762390786547,43.88595033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the formation of rock located directly between All Tuckered Out (Shipyard Rock) and Shark's Tooth.
