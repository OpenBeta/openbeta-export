Fatty Magoo was once ugly... and had no friends. Given a few years and some clean up she is a whole new person just like this block. Cleaned up nicely and was often overlooked or forgotten.  If you are looking at Bueno this is the roof behind you and in the corner. Start down and low on the left side ( closest to corner) Undercling and move to the sharp but good crimps. Crux is getting good feet and matching both hands on the 2nd crimp. DON'T BAIL TO EARLY. Take it out to the arÃªte and then up. Good warm up problem close to the parking lot.","protection":"crash pads the landing is a water drainage not rocky just slightly eroded bring a few pads.","location":"by Bueno in South Seas.

Once that's over another V6 sequence awaits which finishes with a difficult cross through.
