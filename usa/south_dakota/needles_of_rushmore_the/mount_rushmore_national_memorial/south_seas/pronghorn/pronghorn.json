The crux is only a few moves and is down low, around the 3rd bolt -- but the crux and the entire climb are very well protected with bolts until the last 12 feet to the summit.  There are about 10 new bolts on the climb that lead to an anchor on the \"ridge\" with a large chain link attached to it.  There is another anchor with a single link a foot above and to the right of that anchor (other side of the narrow ridge), so it appears that the climb ends there -- about 12 feet short of the summit.  However, it's an easy (5.5ish) climb to the summit from those intermediate anchors, and the summit has a two bolt anchor with short chains on top.  The summit also has great views, so it's well worth going all the way to the top.","protection":"10 or 11 quickdraws.  You can also place trad gear in the two cracks about halfway up, but the new bolts are close enough together that the extra gear is unnecessary.","location":"On the south side of the spire is chimney like formation with a scraggly pine tree just above it.

The spire is about 50 feet tall and appears to have about four routes on it going up the different sides.  It stands off by more or less by itself, even though it is very close to the main South Seas climbing routes. \n\n  An intimidating spire to some. its a small summit that is well worth visiting. This formation is good for the strong minded 5.9 climber as most climbs on it are heady. There is a PG-13, R, and a Dennis Horning X route.
