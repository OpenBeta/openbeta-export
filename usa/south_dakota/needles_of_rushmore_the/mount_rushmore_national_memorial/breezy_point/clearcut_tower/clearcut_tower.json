From the parking/approach at the highway hike up the old road 175 yards and cut across the meadow aiming for the tower right or east of a gap between this and the towers closer to West World proper. From the base of the tower below the crack, scramble up and make a funky move to reach the bottom of the crack. Do the hardest move then use the crack to reach some boulders, a brief face climb and a wide crack to the top passing a smaller column top.","protection":"Medium to large stoppers, .5 to #4 camalots, a couple slings, and there are anchors at the top. Rap is 22 meters. Mar 2017 there is a lower anchor down and right of the tiny tree - looks like a project anchor for a route to the right..","location":"The route is the fine looking crack on the western (left) edge of the Clearcut Tower. Hike to the base of the Tower and belay from a boulder just below the crack. Rap the route with a 60 M rope, or you can 4th/5th class scramble north across a couple smaller column tops to a notch. You can scramble down from the notch and walk back to the base of the climb. A rope is recommended for a scramble off."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,fcb9c76c-57ba-50f2-aa2c-1b574137f473,3b48a6c3-f8e6-52f5-b57a-35a299fb1b7a,86ad2325-f306-5994-92dc-f91a944d0cde,cda8558c-8947-5422-809a-91c4c9709672","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Needles Of Rushmore, The","Mount Rushmore National Memorial","Breezy Point","Clearcut Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.47722,43.88973]},"bbox":[-103.47784394274682,43.88928033981814,-103.4765960572532,43.89017966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111009061","area_id":"zahVjIlHVCKAmpHEyXCWcg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.47784394274682,43.88928033981814],[-103.4765960572532,43.88928033981814],[-103.4765960572532,43.89017966018187],[-103.47784394274682,43.89017966018187],[-103.47784394274682,43.88928033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This area was clear cut by logging activities in about 2014 0r 2015 and there are no living trees in the meadow. The only plants are mullins and others that prefer disturbed soils. This was once a beautiful peaceful grotto - once graced by a pile of timber 30' high right smack in the center of the draw, but in 2017 the pile was slash burned. The mullins and irritating plants have lessened quite a bit (2020). The one climb (2015) faces southeast, on warm winter days with sun is nice and warm and conversely, in the summer on a blazing hot day with not one pine cone for shade - you will roast.
