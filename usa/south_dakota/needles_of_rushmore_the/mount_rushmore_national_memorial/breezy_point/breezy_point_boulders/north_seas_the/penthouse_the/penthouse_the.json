This area sits on top of the ridge that Whine Cellar and the Venue sit on. This would be the next area a few feet above the Venue. Good enclosed area with mainly flat landings. If you were to descend the back side you would walk to The Bus Stop Boulder. Most of the problems here were bouldered by Brent Kertzman and Mikel Cronin. A couple good problems exist. Nice area that usually sits in the sun and bakes even during winter months."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:14.872Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:30.350Z"}
