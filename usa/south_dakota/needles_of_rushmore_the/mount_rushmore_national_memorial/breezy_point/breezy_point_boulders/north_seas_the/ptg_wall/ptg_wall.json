This wall has room for a few more problems. The \"Projects\" to the left of PTG are tall and complex. This wall is slightly overhanging. With a little cleaning these problems could be some of the hardest in the area. Dan Dewell and Blake Workman both cleaned and worked these but had no luck. In the wetter months a nice pool forms at the base. This can either benefit or make it unclimbable. Summer will be dry for most of the time. Stays shaded. With the Pool usually at the base during Spring it can create a SWAMPY mess to try and get to this wall. Along with all the fallen trees this problem likely won't see any traffic until the area cleans up. Awesome stone in a not so awesome area. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:13.606Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:49.873Z"}
