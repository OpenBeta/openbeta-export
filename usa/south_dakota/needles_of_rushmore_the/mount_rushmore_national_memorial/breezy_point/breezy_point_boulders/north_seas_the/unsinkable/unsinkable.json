You'll hit a number of edges that trend in an arc to the right before cutting back left. The crux may be not dabbing your feet on the crash pad behind you higher up on a dynamic move near the top out.\n\n I think as the rock cleans up a bit this line will be a great contribution to the area! I was able to clear most of the choss but have a feeling some more small pebbles will break with use. Definitely worth giving a go, will be an even better climb as it cleans up with a little traffic.","protection":"Used two and a half crash pads for cozy protection.
