When following the trail to the Bus Stop boulder walk about 1 minute from the parking lot. The trail will fork and there will be several logs piled on a rock.

Look for a 3-5 foot gap/passage at about the halfway point of the ridge's length. The problem is at the narrowest point in the gap, on the right-hand side.       Look for a depression, similar to a cursive letter \"R\".(or a lop-sided pyramid) this is the sit-start. there are two right-hand side pulls, with a minimal left foot hold, good right foot hold.
