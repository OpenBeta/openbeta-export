I am not sure on the actual information other than I spent some time with the spearfish crew trying to piece this thing together. Time after Time we would put some effort into it. I got word one day that Chris Hirsch or Aaron Stetzer pieced it together and made the FA. I figured I would add this mainly on the purpose of people climb/ project this quite a bit. I haven't talked to anyone that has climbed this but again, i'm 90% sure I remember someone from Spearfish saying Hirsch or Stetzer did it with them. \n\n SDS Start on two small shitty crimps. Get unique as this problem can be a little scrunched. Throw up and right to hit a decent hold if memory serves me right. Somehow the object is to get to the scrubbed crimps directly above the bulge you are under. Again, I have witnessed some pretty interesting beta that worked and some that has not. However you may get to the crimps on the top of the bulge and mantle to the top. This problem stays on you until you are fully ontop. Any info let me know and I can change. Great problem Chris or Aaron!","protection":"crash pad","location":"East face to the right of Cloudshadow look for the overhanging bulge on the boulder.Â "},"__v":0},{"_id":"W+HTXf8eVfuY+cS1idYaSw==","name":"Glass Castle","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"Dan Dewell","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46947,43.89654]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108408282","mp_crag_id":"108408197","climb_id":"W+HTXf8eVfuY+cS1idYaSw==","areaRef":"2pnflVLvUc+sGf2Zq6f12A=="},"content":{"description":"Sit-start with the right on a good crimp and the left on an excellent undercling.
