Instead of veering to the right upon entering the Rock Maze, veer to the left immediately after parking.  Walk about two-hundred yards or so, and head uphill.

When first walking up the trail take the early left that goes to the west side. Just before you get to any big boulders go left into the words and walk along the outside of the boulders.

If you get to the massive 30 foot vertical boulder you have gone about 30 feet to far. \"The Great Escape\" starts on the obvious jug under the roof.
