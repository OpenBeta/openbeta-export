V5 finish is up and left on a sloper, V3 finish is to the arete on the right.  Very powerful problem and a load of fun. \n\n  Also, there are variations to this problem which make it harder or easier (like most things in the Rock Maze).","protection":"Kind of a downhill landing, but very easy to protect falls.
