Start matched on this with a double toe hook on the jug at the lip (the hold one mantles off of on Muscle Corner). Do a big, awkward reach to that hold and finish as for Muscle Corner. My validation for the FA comes from the fact that I had to dig dirt out of that roof to be able to start this thing.","protection":"A pad I guess.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"foOvP1txUK6MGWJjh7mLQw==","name":"Muscle Corner","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46849,44.15489]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105714791","mp_crag_id":"111146364","climb_id":"foOvP1txUK6MGWJjh7mLQw==","areaRef":"yXxtkqlgWeeKS7E4uh6DVQ=="},"content":{"description":"Find this problem by heading east slightly from the main South Central area.  This is a long roof traverse (about 20 feet or so) that is very low to the ground.  If you fall, you just land in the dirt a foot below.  This problem can be done from left to right, but is better right to left.  Start at a jug and throw your feet to the right on a giant shelf.  From here, monkey your way left until the final hold at the end of the boulder.  Fun and necessary heel hooking, and a cool bicep power move at the halfway point.This became much harder when a large foothold shelf broke off years ago.","protection":"Bouldering Pad, Spotter","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,b8d54bcf-a628-5d21-b8aa-ec8b062a2e9a,19edf775-bc45-519f-aa8a-df9892afeef9,ae3078fd-b731-56d2-9e79-dc66b0c62354,c97c6d92-a960-59e7-8a4b-b138ba1e8355","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Rapid City Area","Rock Maze","South Central (Main Area)","Muscle Corner"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46849,44.15489]},"bbox":[-103.46911673965877,44.15444033981814,-103.46786326034122,44.15533966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111146364","area_id":"yXxtkqlgWeeKS7E4uh6DVQ=="},"content":{"description":"Muscle Corner traverse is a fun short traverse problem.
