It is a fairly long problem, yet it always stays low to the ground with a pretty good landing. Find it by heading around to the main area of the maze.  It is to the right of Slot Machine, and to the left of Muscle Corner. \n\n  Usually done as a sit-down start, start on huge juggy shelfs and make a upward traverse to the right.  Then when grabbing a two-handed slot, head up.  The final moves are the hardest.  This one is pumpy for the modest V2 rating, but the holds are all great.","protection":"Boulder Pad and a Spotter.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"2PWanVHEUqiUKQVQ4O8XSw==","name":"Flossy Tips","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46794,44.15462]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"112143581","mp_crag_id":"111146376","climb_id":"2PWanVHEUqiUKQVQ4O8XSw==","areaRef":"8DIvEvQvWCqvtaqN7GAV7g=="},"content":{"description":"Stand start center of face on tenuous crimps / rails direct face line complete with lousy feet on a slate slab.","protection":"Pads are nice.","location":"Loftus Dental Parking Lot"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,b8d54bcf-a628-5d21-b8aa-ec8b062a2e9a,19edf775-bc45-519f-aa8a-df9892afeef9,ae3078fd-b731-56d2-9e79-dc66b0c62354,f0322f12-f42f-582a-afb5-aa8dec6015ee","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Rapid City Area","Rock Maze","South Central (Main Area)","Southern Discomfort Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2"},{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.46794,44.15462]},"bbox":[-103.4685667367912,44.15417033981813,-103.4673132632088,44.155069660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111146376","area_id":"8DIvEvQvWCqvtaqN7GAV7g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-103.4685667367912,44.15417033981813],[-103.4673132632088,44.15417033981813],[-103.4673132632088,44.155069660181866],[-103.4685667367912,44.155069660181866],[-103.4685667367912,44.15417033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"One of the more classic boulders for the area and the Hills.
