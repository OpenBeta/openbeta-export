It consists of the fewest number of problems but probably has the best ambience, especially in the fall due to the aspen groves.  If you continue hiking past Untranslatable and Jonahs Redemption, you will find a large amount of rock that can be described as a mini-Rock Maze.  This area may contain potential for more problems, although they will tend to be low in size."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:20.938Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:00.480Z"}
