Stay left at all of major intersections and park on top.  I believe it is about 2.9 miles from the highway to the top.  You can not see any rock where you park, but start exploring to the north, south, east, and west and you will find as many as 250 boulder problems on beautiful rock.  There are many crack problems and some short routes.  There are many pictures on this site of Estes Creek.  Much of the concentrated climbing is to the southeast from where you park.  Explore and have fun."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:19.906Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:37.962Z"}
