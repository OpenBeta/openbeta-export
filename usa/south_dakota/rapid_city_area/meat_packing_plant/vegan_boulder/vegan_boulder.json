Keep traversing until the right edge of the rock. \n\n  This route definitely has manufactured footholds, but I would doubt that it was done by climbers.

This problem is somewhat high, but the crux is within safe falling distance.  Also, the landing is fairly smooth other than a rounded rock at the bottom. \n\n  Whether you decide to set a TR off of buttonhead bolts or boulder it out, this is an excellent moderate boulder problem that is great fun. \n\n  Follow the obvious route up jugs through the highest part of the boulder, a little bit left of center.  Crank through great incut holds to a blocky hold near where the rock turns vertical.  Then beware of possible suspect holds that may break near the top.  I have seen at least one hold break off up there.  Descent is easy off the back side.
