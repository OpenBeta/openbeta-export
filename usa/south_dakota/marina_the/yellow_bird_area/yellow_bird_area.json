Splitter fingers and hands out a steep, sustained headwall on the 2nd pitch. The 1st pitch alone is amazing and engaging. No doubt this is a classic, though it might not see much traffic due to the long hike. Possible to see someone climbing the headwall from the parking lot! \n\n  Pitch 1; 5.10+ 100', Climb right facing corner with orange lichen streak. Right below large flared chimney, traverse right across face to splitter .75 crack. Mantel, then place #6 in flake out left. Make a few face moves and transition into OW/flake. Run it to the bolted anchors on easier terrain. \n\n  Pitch 2; 5.11 80', Work through face to gain the beginning of the crack. Couple cruxy moves down low leads to super stellar awesomeness. Enduro fingers and hands followed by more hands out the roof/chimney. Build your own anchor. \n\n  The #6 is pretty necessary for the first pitch. Though it is possible to scramble up the backside and rap in, if you just want to do the 2nd pitch. Needles Style Rappel brings you straight down to the 1st pitch anchors.","protection":"Double rack; BD .5-#3   one #6    few smaller cams   nuts","location":"This is the most colorful chunk of rock on the hilltop.

The second pitch climbs the overhanging arête which is the profile of the formation seen from the lake. Begin the same as Yellow Bird, but instead of going left into the wide flake, stay right on the nice size crack to another set of anchors. In the beginning of the second pitch be wary where your rope is running, use long slings. Punch it through the short thin hands/ringlocks section. Little more gear climbing before venturing out to the bolts on the arête. Steep and wild finish!
