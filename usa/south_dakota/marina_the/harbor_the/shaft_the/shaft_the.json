Wrap around spire and make belay behind spire on top of chockstones. Take crack with one pin to upper face with one star drive bolt. One more star drive is on top, but don't use this to belay ;). \n\n  Hard to know what summit this truly is. John Evans is one of the first to climb back here, and this spire is one of the more eye catching. And Piana's map does show The Shaft as being located in this area. However, I don't believe he placed bolts. Or even if star drives were available then. Horning, on the other hand, did use bolts. Another route of his (Renn's Nest) is protected just like this climb; one pin, one star drive, and another on the top.","protection":"One pin   Two star drive bolts   single rack to BD #3   Needles rap from top, then rap off chockstone to the E.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,253ab2e3-944f-5c5f-8477-58a428c86291,71be2686-2e86-5d59-8713-be06e63139f5,c979b837-510d-537d-b87a-e775c6d82a34,34505f14-db42-544e-b37d-248ab0f86411","pathTokens":["USA","South Dakota","Marina, The","Harbor, The","Shaft, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.5389,43.85829]},"bbox":[-103.5395236136558,43.857840339818125,-103.53827638634418,43.85873966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111784985","area_id":"NFBfFNtCVE6zfSSKsPhkEQ=="},"content":{"description":"This may or may not be the true Shaft spire.
