Start by climbing outside right of the cave, holds are surprising hard to get some being slick and others just not the best of quality. Move to the left when exiting the cave top. Slanderous follows an obvious Black streak down the Great North Wall. Best time to do it is on a sunny day in winter as you can belay from down below where as summer you top belay. First 2-3 moves are pure friction with tiny crimps and side holds. Towards the top you get a few better holds but its very tricky. Beautiful line.","protection":"Nice trees and cracks at top to sling up an anchor.","location":"When parking at the bridge parking lot right when you cross the bridge.
