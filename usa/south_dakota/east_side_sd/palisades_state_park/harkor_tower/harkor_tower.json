A thin layer of debris was deposited by glaciers atop the quartzite. Beds of dark red pipestone can be found between the layers. \n\n  This is one of the few areas in the nation where pipestone is found. The mineral was considered sacred by American Indians and depressions still remain where it was once quarried.  \n\n  For millions of years, Split Rock Creek cut deep gorges through Palisades State Park. Geologists estimate the Sioux quartzite spires are 1.2 billion years old.  \n\n  Four hiking trails twist and turn through these beautiful Sioux quartzite formations. The cliffs and formations are also used by organized climbing groups to practice their scaling and rappelling techniques. Bolting is not allowed on the quartzite formations.
