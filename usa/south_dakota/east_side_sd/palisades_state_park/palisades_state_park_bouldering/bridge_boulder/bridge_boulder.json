It is the most sought after V4 and by far the best. The name comes from the seam feature on the boulder. There was originally a old jagged stump that one would have to cover with pads and it made it less than ideal to fall. Around 2011 the Stump was removed and for about a year it lay next to this climb as climbers who couldn't get established would grab the stump and place it back in the whole as a cheater start. I'm guessing the stump has now been completely dissolved. Work a series of side pulls and underclings. Smearing is key with the feet. This problem is one of the few in Palisades that actually gets good friction with the feet. ","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"6QLigO/BWZOL6dSReBxSmw==","name":"Grenada","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"Michael Madsen--2009","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.5181,43.68872]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106754667","mp_crag_id":"114552259","climb_id":"6QLigO/BWZOL6dSReBxSmw==","areaRef":"+b3K47lRWfiokkxF28skTg=="},"content":{"description":"This problem is a contender for best V2 in the park.
