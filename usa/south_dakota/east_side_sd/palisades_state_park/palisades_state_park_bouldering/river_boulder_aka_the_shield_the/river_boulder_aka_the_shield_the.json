Start low on the upstream end of the River Boulder on the two jugs on either side of the bulge. Get low and difficult to see feet, or a heel/toe hook around the right edge. Manage your way up the bulge with a couple powerful throws and slaps up the arete feature to your right. \n\nThis problem is an eliminate and does not use the face to the left of the bulge and stays on the bulge itself the entire time. If you use the face then you climbed the original problem, Irregular Arete V1.","protection":"The low crux can be protected easily with one pad but it would have been nice to have another and a spotter for the top out.","location":"To get to the river boulder, take the first left in the park, park right away.
