Hung Like A Horse is to the left of the Arete. You start with an easy sandstone like features. Then once you get balanced and standing you reach up and a little right with your right hand and then swinging out and around the overhang you match with your left. Now with your left hand on the sideways sloper you throw your right hand to the nasty side pull to the right. Airy-balance plays out here now as your hanging stretched out comes the hardest move taking the right hand which is in the side pull to the right you dyno a good 3-4ft to top out. The top out is a great hold.
