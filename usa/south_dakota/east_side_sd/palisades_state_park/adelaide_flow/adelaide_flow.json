It can be found off the drainage that dumps into Split Creek by Beer Tower.   Depending on the flow it can see a long couloir of thick ice up to 5-8 ft deep. On good years it can produce the whole couloir on wet seasons the top part can be drifted over careful where you step with 5 ft drifts and small \"pond\" on top by the drainage water can reach knee height if you fall threw. Leaning Tower Flow comes in as a warm up to the left of Adelaide."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:11.055Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:25.365Z"}
