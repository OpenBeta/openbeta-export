This excellent route is the 2nd from the left that begins up a slight ramp using a sidepull feature. At the top of the ramp, the climbing gets really difficult, with a powerful crux on small holds and bad feet that requires precision. After the crux, fun powerful climbing leads to a huge rest (the route would be so much harder if it wasn't there, I kind of wish it wasn't). After the rest, the top has a great 5.12 finishing sequence on sidepulls and crimps, with a \"thank god\" jug to clip the anchors. This route was rebolted a few years ago, and currently has a somewhat unnecessary runout at the top. A fall going to the anchors would be kind of nasty. I hope to get the Canyon Custodian up there to add a bolt. I will update this description once that is done.","protection":"Lots of bolts, 10 I think.
