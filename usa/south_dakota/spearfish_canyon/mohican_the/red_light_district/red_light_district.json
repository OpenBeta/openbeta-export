Do Totally Flaked first and then go do two routes on sick, black stone on the far right hand side of The Head Shop Wall. If you sent all three of those routes on the Head Shop Wall you should really consider just hopping on Loaf & Jug because it really is a hoot. \n\n  If you hiked up Trail 2 because you were attracted to either Yippie-Kiy-Yay and you had someone in your party who really wanted to try The Joker, then Loaf & Jug should really be on your ticklist. If you are still in the need for that level of climbing head to The Read Light District by walking past The Gully of Biblical Proportions, The Trail of Tears Wall, and an easy to miss area known as Purgatory. Going this way makes this route one of the last on the wall. Easily identifiable as one of the least overhung routes in this area dominated by a large, bouldery roof. \n\n  Loaf and Jug actually has the same start as Naked at 7-11, which goes at 5.8 and is a better route than Fossil Logic. If 5.8 is feeling good then head right for Loaf and Jug or straight up to get Naked at 7-11.
