Every sequence and move requires a thinking cap and a ballerina finesse. The pump really hits ya about three fourths of the way up when the holds get bigger, but are still out of reach and still hidden. \n\n  Probably impossible to onsight unless you climb like a girl or have a pair of wings sprouting from your beefy back. Red points at 5.11b after many, many, many attempts and heartbreaks. \n\n  If you are looking for an 11b that won't eat up your entire vacation something like \"Oh That Smell\" might be more up your alley.

What you might think is the start, is not the start. Start as right as you can without getting into the upper starting holds of Cyclops. Don't leave the ledge at the very beginning.

They were male demons, which would apparently show up in the middle of the night, in order to get busy with women who claimed to be sound asleep. I guess this not only makes them the original booty call from hell, but if you've ever seen pictures of women from the middle ages, my gut instinct tell me that these horny dudes were also chubby chasers. \n\n  Seriously though, if there is a 5.12a in Spearfish Canyon that does not deserve four or five stars, this would be it. However, I am here to be a cheerleader, not a critic.  \n\n  The only reason I'm not too down with this route is due to the fact that it handed me my ass and the falls I took caused me to slam painfully into the rock. This climb is not only physically demanding, it is also very beta intensive, and believe me, the first go more than likely won't be a fun time.  \n\n  However, the eternal optimist in me wants everyone to know that it's a great route to project (if you like punishment), I'm sure it will make you strong and I'm quite certain things might go better for you if you head to the blonde rock to the left of the bolts instead of trying to follow the bolt line like I did.  \n\n  However, with that said, please be advised that this is truely a 5.12a for 5.12+ climbers and the rides on this thing can get pretty fat and ugly...just like chicks the Incubus apparantly goes for.
