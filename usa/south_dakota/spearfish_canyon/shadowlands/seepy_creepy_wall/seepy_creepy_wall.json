A whole YEAR to pave a freaking road?) this epic, little nightmare has a hard, bouldery start and a few dozen feet of SWEET moves that abruptly end at a roof pull from hell. \n\n  The nightmare begins with big, yet strange holds to a contortionistic foot placement that will set you up for a hellish deadpoint move to a creey crimp that is supposed to be there, but more than likely isn't. \n\n  Be prepared to take the ride to the twilight zone and back! This roof is a bitch. Take my advice, don't fall asleep, whatever you do, don't fall asleep! And be sure to do a few thousand pull-ups and eat your Wheaties before getting on this psycho-killer of a route.","protection":"Six bolts.

However, if the lines to the courthouse are long, this evil, little son-of-a-bitch will bring you just as much pleasure and pain as any route in the area. \n\n  A miserably evil start leads to really good sequences and moves on holds that are hard as hell to hold onto. Be prepared to battle a whole school of sharks, with lasers on their heads, and then pull over a bulge that becomes more difficult if you have a puddly paunch instead of a super agent six pack. \n\n  Don't wait in line for a Courthouse climb when you could be climbing this route and threatening the whole world with your self destruction! JUST about everyone in the Canyon Crew agrees that this is an experience worth at least one million dollars.","protection":"6 bolts.
