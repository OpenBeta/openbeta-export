But once you get your groove going and find the odd, yet pleasurable places to put your hands, it becomes great five eleven fun climbing straight to the championship round.  \n\n  Definitely a route that will teach you to stand up for yourself.","protection":"8 bolts.

This climb gives you the business quick and doesn't stop until the chaffing becomes unbearable. \n\n  Oh Danielson, come spanky your wanky while you yank yourself up a fairly continuous route full of ways to further your self-abuse. Have yourself some sensual private time at this really fun, semi-secluded climb that pulls on wicked small, but awesome holds. \n\n  Great fun! A good climb in a great location for doing things that you ought to be doing away from everyone else anyway.","protection":"3 bolts...but it's a good idea to take 10 quickdraws.","location":"Come on! Take the long trek to experience this piece of athletic art. Hike past the Court House Wall and The Green Mile.

Great early morning shade in the heat of summer. \n\n  This is Spearfish Canyon's 400th described route on Mountain Project! Keep em' coming! Keep em' climbing and don't take yourself too seriously! Keep it real and keep it fun! Create art for art's sake and enjoy the beat down and the joy a great project, like this, is going give you.
