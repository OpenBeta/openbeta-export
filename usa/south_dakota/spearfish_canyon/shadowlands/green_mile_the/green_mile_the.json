This area contains two separate walls. The wall on the left is blonde rock that contains The Gift and Norm's route. These are two popular beginner routes that get sun in the early afternoon. The wall to the right consists of black, slabby rock which is home to some uber-classic two star lines. The black wall is located next to a tunnel that was blasted through the mountain in order to accommodate the infamous Homestake aqueduct system. This pipe system is made of a combination of wood, old-fashion terracotta and concrete. It's origins from the days of yore gives The Shadowlands a bit of historical significance and is guaranteed to be a source of fascination for anyone who has read a book or watched The History Channel. It might also be the reason the route names for the wall contain reference to laying pipe. With the innuendo aside, the combination of cool air blowing from the tunnel, and the fact that this wall never sees daylight, makes it a perfect afternoon retreat on scorching summer days."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:20.923Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:59.825Z"}
