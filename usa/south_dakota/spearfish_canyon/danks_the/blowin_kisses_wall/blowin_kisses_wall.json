This is a two star climb. It is the kind of climb that is cool simply because it brags about how uncool it is. Some of you will love it, some of you will hate it. Those of you -who like the five ten classic moves of The Roach- will probably dig this climb as well. Just be warned! The route is centered on a panel of rock between two dirty cracks. So think about it, even though side pulls adorn both sides of the route, there is very little point in looking for something to stuff your hand into, because you might just lose your watch.  \n\n  A ROUTE THAT DEMANDS YOU PULL ON POCKETS INSTEAD OF YOUR PUD! \n\n  Pocket moves are found in abundance on this two star wonder. Creative climbers can probably string together a whole bunch of contrived moves in order to get a good warm-up in. The route is good fun if you are a beginner. Advanced climbers may find that the climbing is more geared towards working out than committing your crushing juice to. A good crux emerges when the route starts to boogie its flabby slab to the left and the climber gets one really sick hand jam before committing to hairy moves above the last bolt to the anchors. Like every fat chick joke, this route is worth telling at least once...until the civilized human being in you realizes that body shaming is uncool and the big ones get loved more than you think. Go on and get on it! You know you want to!","protection":"9 bolts. Big ugly sport anchors.","location":"6th route from the left hand side of The Blowin' Kisses Wall.
