Stick-clip the first 2 bolts.   Start a bit to the right of the bolt line and climb crimps up to a v-shaped undercling in the 1st roof. Match on the undercling (or you can cross through) and head straight left to get established by the 2nd bolt under the 2nd big roof. Big, punchy moves get you out the roofs onto the headwall where the climbing remains challenging.   The route is 3 stars when it's in its \"clean\" state. The holds under the roof have the tendency to get dirty.

If you've never had your cherry popped at the 5.9 level, I would highly recommend stick clipping the first two bolts, because Thumbelina likes it rough, and has kicked off her fair share of 5.10 climbers. Trust me, decking out in this area is no trip to the magic kingdom. After a steep start with shallow pockets, the adventure gets pretty exciting with good movement up a sexy arete.
