The climbing on the black buttress is superb. If this route were only the 2nd through 4th bolt, I would STILL give it 4 stars.    Begin to the left of a small tree stump and do a semi-hard move to get established. The 2nd bolt looks like a long way away, but it's easy. Plus you want that 2nd bolt high when it comes time to clip the 3rd.... Big pulls on good pockets lead to the sidepull crux move to a mailslot pocket. From there you get a great crimper section leading to a huge rest. From the rest, it's 3 more bolts of easy 5.10. Going to the anchors is a bit runout, but relatively easy.","protection":"7 bolts, closed cold shut anchors","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"DW/f//LSX964evu7bbEr/Q==","name":"Skunk Boy","yds":"5.11+","grades":{"yds":"5.11+","french":"7a"},"fa":"Greg Parker","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.90765,44.35135]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105880189","mp_crag_id":"105880167","climb_id":"DW/f//LSX964evu7bbEr/Q==","areaRef":"hovrxpAXWrqXW5KmFC+A4w=="},"content":{"description":"This route follows the black and white streak up the left side of the buttress, beginning on the slab and finishing through the right side of the bulge.

Skunk Boy sounded like a superhero to me, so this is his sidekick, Stinky....   I think this route is actually better than Skunk Boy, but I can't seem to get anyone else to climb it. Begin on the first 4 bolts of Skunk Boy, but get the pocket by the 4th with your right hand this time. Clip and head up and left via a series of cool moves. You will get to a rest that's right by a big chimney filled with bat and mouse shit (another reason for the name). Find a hidden undercling for your left hand and clip the bolt high above your head on the bulge. The crux sequence in the bulge is awesome and it includes a big throw to a ledge off of tiny holds. From the ledge climb up and right to the anchors of Skunk Boy. Go out and try this one. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","protection":"7 bolts, closed cold shut anchors","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"kV4rlrnUVHyGeEpI9LEg8g==","name":"Polecat","yds":"5.12c","grades":{"yds":"5.12c","french":"7b+"},"fa":"Mike Cronin","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.90765,44.35135]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"105881471","mp_crag_id":"105880167","climb_id":"kV4rlrnUVHyGeEpI9LEg8g==","areaRef":"hovrxpAXWrqXW5KmFC+A4w=="},"content":{"description":"The beginning of this route looks impossible.
