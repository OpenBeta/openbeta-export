If you have the strength to keep going this route has a high send-ability factor because the eleven climbing is pretty much over after the roof pull. \n\n  A great follow-up climb if you got lucky on Lucky Strike or a great warm-up for Electric Sex because of the steep, powerful climbing you will encounter while working your way up this sexy arete.","protection":"8 bolts.
