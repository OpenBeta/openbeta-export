If there is a route at The Sunshine Wall that is hard to find, and easy to walk right on by without seeing it, Orange Streak fits the description to a tee. If you can find The Dinner Plate Wall, the trick is to keep walking along the wall -towards Cheyenne Crossing- the best you can while constantly looking past your left shoulder. Do not gaggle at the scenery, do not look down at your feet, and for God's sake, don't blink. Orange streak is located on a small wall that looks like a crumbly piece of choss, but the rock is solid and the climbing is just as difficult and about as challenging as Astro-Pop, just not as classic and sought after. For those who love the EMB route, here is your next challenge, if you don't get lost trying to find it.","protection":"Bring 10 quickdraws.","location":"?"},"__v":0},{"_id":"bRWL0EqmXy6JbqJNVvJMsg==","name":"Old Number Seven","yds":"5.11b","grades":{"yds":"5.11b","french":"6c"},"fa":"Mike McNeil","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.89038,44.29596]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105918992","mp_crag_id":"105918989","climb_id":"bRWL0EqmXy6JbqJNVvJMsg==","areaRef":"7ksAMWjSUWSDsti/QZ4+JA=="},"content":{"description":"This route is the middle route on the wall.
