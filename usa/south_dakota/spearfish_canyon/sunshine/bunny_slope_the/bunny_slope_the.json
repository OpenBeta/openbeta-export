From there expect smooth sailing until the terrain starts to get steep again. \n\n  Smaller holds and more intimidating, exposed moves will make you shrivel and choose your line very carefully right up to a nice rest just as the line starts to really kick back and get serious. \n\n  The level of fitness, marathon length and techincal movement on small, hard to read holds for the last three bolts makes this climb in league with Albert's Arete and Candy Apple Grey. If you love those climbs, get on this one! If you are a newly-forged five ten climber get on this thing to feel the more potent sting of what to expect at the 5.11 minus grade. \n\n  AWESOME! SWEET!
