Well, then...it's time to feel good. \n\n  This five-ten-fun-fest of a route starts on overhanging, black- pocketed rock and makes you scratch and claw your way to a slab. Crawl up the yellow-belly using crimpers and way comfortable monos. Pull through a series of moves that will stretch you into jugs and set you up for a great rest under the black roof. \n\n  Take as much time as you need to relax, pull the roof on jugs and start walking on the slab-tastic crimps and small holds to an exposed crux with thinker moves. After just enough of an adrenaline rush you'll end up on bigger holds that are sure to put a smile back on that sour-puss face of yours. \n\n  Semi-pumpy, quasi-burly moves, combined with the good, long jaunt it takes to get to the anchors, makes this climb a great warm-up or the next challenge for aspiring climbers who wish to push into the grade. If you just sent Sylvester Sidewalk, this is your next challenge.","protection":"13 comfortably placed bolts, with just enough of a run-out at the top to send a chill up the spine, and sporty anchors.","location":"Left-most slab to a roof route on The Attitude Wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"HbRFQO6BVD2GHDaryKdefA==","name":"Mean Streak","yds":"5.12b/c","grades":{"yds":"5.12b/c","french":"7b+"},"fa":"Mike Cronin","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-103.89038,44.29596]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"107436482","mp_crag_id":"106020663","climb_id":"HbRFQO6BVD2GHDaryKdefA==","areaRef":"FYfozRdrXz6E98UkIcm/5w=="},"content":{"description":"","protection":"9 bolts.
