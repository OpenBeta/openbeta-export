This might be a good boulder to start with if you wasted the last eight years of your life binge watching HBO fantasy shows steeped in disappointment.\n\n Note: This is more than likely not a \"new\" boulder. Locals have climbed it for years. However, it has now been cleaned of choss and all the big, pointy rocks have been removed from the landing zones. Hopefully these slight improvements will get more pebble pounders to come and crush it since it deserves to be climbed. Topping out and walking off the back are easy. This might not be a \"destination area\" but it is a good place to get a quick workout in."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:20.941Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:28.898Z"}
