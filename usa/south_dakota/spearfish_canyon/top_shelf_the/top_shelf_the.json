If your New Year's resolutions for 2020 include getting strong as hell be sure to put at least a few dozen laps on this route as part of your workout routine. Those of you who have sent \"Ripsnorter\" (at Thunderhead) will appreciate the big holds (and radical rail) of this super steep route. Those of you who appreciate some technical prowess (with a super-sized helping of powerful pump) will love the precision placement of the much needed heel hooks and heel toe cams one needs to execute precisely in order to get up this beast without getting chewed up and spit off. Throw in the powerfully precise pinch (pulled off from a groin destroying stem) and you have a high probability of taking the ride in an area of the canyon where there is nothing but three hundred feet of air between you and the creek below. Make no mistake! This is a route more suited to big wall high ballers (than piddly, puddly pebble pounders) who want to get stoopidly pumped while they get hella scared. GET ON IT!","protection":"The draws will be hanging until BBQ sends. You have until the end of spring 2020!","location":"Have a Spearfish resident take you climbing here!
