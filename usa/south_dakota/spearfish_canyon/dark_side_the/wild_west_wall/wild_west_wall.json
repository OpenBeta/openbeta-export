Enjoy a full value start to a stoopid big pocket. Take a big breath and start plugging two finger pockets to more two finger pockets. Enjoy a challenging sequence of super sick crimps and good pockets to a series of moves that involve about four sinker monos. Enjoy some bigger holds that get you into some run out easier territory which is followed by a swath of decently big holds that throw a thousand pumpy moves at you before letting off just below the anchors. \n\n  This is one of the best 5.12 minus climbs on the left hand side of The Darkside crag. The long hike is worth it. Enjoy one of the better hikes in terms of biodiversity and get set up at a really cool hang.
