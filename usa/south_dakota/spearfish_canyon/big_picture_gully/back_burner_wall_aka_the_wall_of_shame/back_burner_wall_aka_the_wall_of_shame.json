Bolted on August afternoons and sent in Sendtember. Blonde, burly and overhung. This route starts on small holds which lead to smaller side pulls, laybacks and gastones in a sick finger crack.  \n\n  SUSTAINED AND PHYSICALLY DEMANDING! After the finger crack, jog up a series of jugs and get a good rest at the top of a flake. \n\n  From there use side pulls, gastons and body tension to work your way to a ledge. Grab a sick flake, clip the last bolt and gain altitude on layback crimpers to a crucial crimp. A tricky, heart-breaker crux makes you throw for an out of reach jug by the anchors. SPORTY!

Back in the good old days (when Bruce Junek was still writing a guidebook) some local guys rapped down the face of this wall, placed a few sets of anchors...and then got busy doing something else.  \n\n  Fifteen years later I found myself with nothing to do and a strange, uncontrollably desire to finish what they started. After a few weeks of cleaning (with Mike Cronin's blessing) I found myself taking the ride on some pretty sick routes that turned out to be quite a bit harder than I initially expected. \n\n  Dubbed \"The Wall of Shame\" simply because it is a shame that these routes were not finished sooner, this little wall is turning out to be a pretty good addition to an area that already holds a high concentration of Taster's Choice served up with the buttery sickness.  \n\n  Procrastination built this nation. More routes will be on the way if myself (or anyone else) feels the motivation. We hope the results will motivate you to visit this part of Spearfish Canyon more."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:11.629Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:26.192Z"}
