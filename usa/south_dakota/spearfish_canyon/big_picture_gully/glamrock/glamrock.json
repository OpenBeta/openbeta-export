And I am a rocker. Back in the days of my mullet, I listened to all of these bands, Skid Row, Pantera, Faster Pussy Cat and probably a bit of Winger until Bevis and Butthead made it cool to hate them. Heavy metal and glam rock were a huge part of my life (still is) and to have an entire wall devoted to the music that made my adolescence tolerable is quite an honor. But Super Atomic Night Shirt? Who the hell are they? Of course, there were a billion of these bands during the 80's and 90's that had one hit on the Head Banger's Ball and then faded off into obscurity. They played a club, got a record contract, became addicted to drugs, went bankrupt and some of them get to play the state fair every once in a while. But I imagine the guys in Super Atomic Night Shirt are probably golf caddies somewhere right now. \n\n  Where am I going with this? \n\n  Oh yeah! This is a good route with a weird name. The yellow canyon guide book goes on some diatribe about not using a crack or something. Screw that! Do whatever you want! Rock on! It's a fun nine with some neat moves and I remember having a blast on it several years ago when I was on a climbing date with the rockin' chick I eventually married. I haven't done it since, but it's like a hair metal song worth playing at least once before you get side tracked by Nirvana and the rest of those grunge pussies. \n\n  Seattle rock and roll. What the hell was that all about anyway? I remember winning Pearl Jam's Ten CD at my Senior Prom. For some strange reason, at the time, listening to that album caused me to burn all my hair metal tapes and made me want to wear flannels. When I started college, and wanted a change in life, I stopped listening to metal for a while and got into Morrissey and Concrete Blonde...and now, I realize my mistake...but that's another story.","protection":"This route has five well placed bolts and if you are a beginning climber do this route right after Beggar's Banquet to see if you have what it takes to continue on as a Spearfish Canyon climber.
