This route is SWEET! Starts on slopy pockets which lead to sloper ledges which lead to better pockets and edges which leads to a funky, yet totally wild crux that involves a sidepull that needs to be turned into an undercling which at that point requires you to get into a twisting, spread eagle sort of stance which caused me to fart and laugh myself off the route. \n\n  Hang #1 - Get resituated, rid yourself of excess gas and get ready to send. \n\n  Attempt #2 - Get the undercling stance thing and launch for a jug of a ledge which was not visible during attempt #1. But when you stick it this jug is SWEET! \n\n  The rest of the climb is a bit of a nail bitter but much more doable than Kill Phil or International Distress. Not to bag on those climbs, cause they are SWEET, but this climb might be a better one to start on since it get shade earlier and is a bit less strenuous. \n\n  This is an awesome climb which might be a totally doable 5.11 for some and a total headache for others. This route is good fun and if the next guidebook author does not give it at least three stars I am going to send Orca the killer whale to take a dump on their lawn.  \n\n  I loves this climb and I suggest you do it! In fact, do it all day long and then get on Kill Phil and International Distress when the shade finally comes.","protection":"10 bolts. Open shut anchors.
