Rock is fairly good, but the routes have not been climbed a lot since being put in.  I have on two occasions seen a waterfall coming directly down on these routes from the large gulley above after a some particularly heavy downpoors.  That being said these routes are close to town and have a short approach.  They will clean up with time, and we knocked a few pebbles loose when climbing on them recently.  The rock here seems to have a little different charachter with some fairly steep climbing to the cruxes that tend to be just verticle or a little less.  the routes face east and will get shade in the afternoon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:10.575Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:24.830Z"}
