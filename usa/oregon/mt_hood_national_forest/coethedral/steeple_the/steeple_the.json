Sometimes Plaidman was solo, sometimes getting Rhonda or Rick to belay. Rick and Scott came back and freed it afterwards with Ricky snagging the leads on the cruxes and cruising them. Route is well bolted as the bolts are sturdy 1/2 x 5-1/2 Stainless steel and not runout.  but pro is recommended for the first 60 feet which is a cruiser 5.7. A single 60 meter is all you need to rappel off.  \n\n  The rock is solid, sort of an andesitic cross between Smith Rock Welded Tuft and Maple Canyon cobbles.

However, from your car in the little turnaround next to the closed off spur road, the best way is to hike approx 225 paces up the overgrown near closed road that heads west, turning left into the woods over a small culvert on a small log and head straight up, paralleling just left of a drainage in the semi-open areas until you see some small cliffs which had not been previously visible just on your right. Pass through the Devils Club (some clippers will easily clear a trail through this small patch) and skirt the cliffs on the left approx 200' more tending up and left until you get to the base of the NW side of the Steeple. This is for North and west side routes, including the Beckey Route.
