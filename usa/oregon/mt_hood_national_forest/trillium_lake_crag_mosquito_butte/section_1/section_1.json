Stay in the left of the \"cave,\" clip the bolt above it, and traverse left to the anchors. The anchors are just around to the left. There's a bolt from another route at foot level.\n\n The anchors can be reached from above, and you can set up a top rope safely if you use a sling around a small tree, but rope drag and pendulum falls are a thing here. You might have better luck than I did by extending the TR anchor with rope, but it's probably best to just lead this, rappel the natural fall line to the left, and top rope one of the other climbs.","protection":"6? bolts.
