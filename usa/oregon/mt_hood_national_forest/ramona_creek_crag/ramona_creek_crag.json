Hood National Forest, this area receives sun all day.   Only a few routes have been climbed here, so loose rock is present on the unclimbed lines- especially above the talus field where the cliff is actively shedding flakes. Unclimbed rock in the forest at either end is very solid, but requires some gardening.   Nearly 200 ft. tall and a over a 1/4 mile long, this area could support many more routes and become a wonderful 'backcountry crag' with an easy, flat approach.   ADMIN NOTE: Reminder that this area is in the Mt Hood Wilderness, which means all bolts must be drilled by hand, and all fixed gear (anchors) must be natural colored slings."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:24.470Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:11.025Z"}
