There are lots of nice cracks here that take protection very well. A standard rack will do the trick on most all the routes, offset nuts are very useful. Pay attention to the wood signs that point out the Non-Climbing areas. DO NOT CLIMB IN THESE AREAS! This is due to an endangered plant species and there is a good relationship between the NFS and the climbing community.\n\nWhen climbing at Pete's Pile, you can enjoy a stunning view of Mt Hood.\n\nPark on the East side of the road in between Klinger Springs and Tamanawas Falls trailhead (45.401957, -121.569402)."},"density":3.4,"totalClimbs":17,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:24.869Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:27:11.333Z"}
