Fun and Dynamic movement thru the roof.\n\n PITCH 3: 5.10a - Move to the right, climb the steep arete clipping bolts and a few gear placements. Finish thru an overhang to the left to a big ledge with bolted anchors.\n\n To descend, rappel with a single rope to the top of the 2nd Pitch, from here a 2 rope rappel will get you to the ground (Because of the large overhang of the roof, it is recommended doing the 2nd rappel to the ground with 2 ropes, as it can be difficult to access the anchors at the top of Pitch 1 when you are hanging 20 feet away from the wall!)","protection":"Bring a large rack with very small cams, doubles on small and medium cams, and a 3.5 cam to protect the crux of the route.
