Mostly cleaned by Royce, Brandis, Alex, Kristen and myself. Many variations on the problems have been done from V0-V5. Nothing was really named; the right RTL lip traverse is a classic, and climbing straight up the overhung prow to a crux lip encounter is an enjoyable heady sloper problem."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:24.873Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:14.905Z"}
