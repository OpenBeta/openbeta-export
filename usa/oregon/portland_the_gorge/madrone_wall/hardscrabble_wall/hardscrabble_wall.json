The holds are all there but it's a strenuous pull. Once over this final bulge, scramble upwards to the black Metolius rap hangers. Lower off your own gear or rappel straight down and you'll go over the Mind Games crux roof.\n\nAlternative 1 (5.8?):Â Take the line indicated in Olson's guidebook; step left where the hand crack cuts right under the roof.
