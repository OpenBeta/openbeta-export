Climbing from the bottom of the cliff to the very top makes for an epic long climb. If 5.9/ 5.10- is near your limit, it is advisable to break it into multiple pitches due to the dangers of decking on the many ledges on this climb. If climbing with a 60m rope, lower (or rappel) to the first set of anchors, pull the rope, and lower (or rappel) again.","protection":"Bolts","location":"The first bolted line on the left hand side of the main face. "},"__v":0},{"_id":"1fJ+Tj54WDeMdkMNmGDkbQ==","name":"Pier Pressure","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.37605,45.53986]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"120233932","mp_crag_id":"120107981","climb_id":"1fJ+Tj54WDeMdkMNmGDkbQ==","areaRef":"xN6u4gPGVJ+FfpNivptcFg=="},"content":{"description":"There is an obvious bolted face/crack climb about 7ft to the right of Eagles Wing. Pitch 1) Starts on face holds traversing right into an challenging crack followed by a tame topout onto the ledge with two sets of anchors. Pitch 2) The second pitch of this climb is directly above the second higher set of anchors.

Super fun and super safe. Get on it! Pitch 1: Do some easy climbing on gear to get to a crux bolt, make the crux move right around the corner. Place some more optional pro and make your way to anchors.  There are three anchors on the ledge. I went to the middle one to set up for the second pitch. Tim Olson calls this pitch 5.11. Pitch 2: Fully bolted and kicks up with some intensity. Follow the bolt line immediately above you.  In the middle of the rock face there are two bolt lines that are close together. Take the left of the two. I found moving off the first bolt to be the first crux. There are two distinct cruxes. Tim calls this 11+ and that feels somewhat accurate to me. Pitch 3: There is a third pitch but I have not been on it yet.
