The movement on this route is straight forward ( I did this with an old pair of trail runners) and the pro isn't terrible. The route wouldn't be that bad if someone wanted to go through the effort of cleaning all the moss off the route. One more thing to include is that there is a terrible thorn monster midway up the route. He ate both me and my partner. If you see him, please slay the dreadful thing. Fat bolts await the amazing climber directly above the main block.","protection":"Pro to 2\"","location":"This route runs up a meandering crack along the right side of the obvious block sticking out from the middle of the wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"6SQ+uqvGUiu/iG71noEWSQ==","name":"Bread & Vine","yds":"5.10b","grades":{"yds":"5.10b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.3715,45.53647]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"117937051","mp_crag_id":"108302961","climb_id":"6SQ+uqvGUiu/iG71noEWSQ==","areaRef":"u78fqE7wXZqai62hjJQSZQ=="},"content":{"description":"AKA: Orangesicle Wet DreamStart at the base of a small \"buttress\" on clean rock, to the first pitch crux protected by a bolt.  Pull the 5.9+ layback/slab crux through a (sometimes) weepy section to cruiser climbing to the first anchor.  Now the route really gets good!  Move up the dihedral through a finger crack to a stance below the overhang above.  Move left on sloping undercling crux, clip the mercy bolt and continue left to a good jug.  From here it's straight up the orange lichen dihedral through bulges/mantles (nice little hand crack at the end) to the top anchor near the top of the wall.  Superbly done as a single pitch (just use light pro on the cruiser section, bypass anchor, and extend in the tight corner.)  If rapping with a 70m you'll reach the trail, otherwise use the intermediate anchors.","protection":"Standard rack to 3ish (3 not necessary though a 2 is).
