A couple other variations and routes do exist however, but the rock itself can get easily crowded if there's even more than a single climbing team out there. So, beware on nice sunny weekends... \n\n  Can be climbed year round, but more typically late spring once the rains slow down, and into late fall; as the rock can be extremely slippery once wet. \n\n  Also to note that this column is made out of Oregon's finest loose rock, so be very mindful of hand placements as well as protection; some rocks have kindly been marked with chalked X's, but do proceed with caution.
