Currently routes range from 5.10b to 5.13d, with a high concentration in the 12+ to 13+ range on the main wall. Several equipped projects may reach into the 5.14 range.\n\n The crag is primarily north facing and stays shaded for the majority of the day. Large roofs above the main wall make rainfall a non-issue for the steeper lines. Winter gets prohibitively cold, but climbing is possible the rest of the year. Breezey summer mornings can be very pleasant, even when it's 90 degrees in the parking lot. Spring can see some seepage.\n\n While the route quality can be excellent, the rock quality can be very chossy. Always beware breaking holds and loose rock.\n\n ***It is highly recommended to wear a helmet, especially on the belay.***\n\n If anyone wants to contribute to the fixed gear there: gofundme.com/viento-fixed-g…"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":41,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:22.831Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:37.811Z"}
