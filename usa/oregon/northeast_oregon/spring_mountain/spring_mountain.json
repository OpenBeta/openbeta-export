There is a nice variety of sport and trad climbs anywhere from 5.4 to 5.13 on fairly solid andesite.  Most of the climbs are about a half pitch in length but there are a few multi-pitch routes that top out.   \n\n  The crag is nestled in the Blue Mountains and has an excellent vista of the nearby mountains including Mount Emily that overlooks the nearby Grande Ronde Valley.  Large talus fields line the base of the crag and create an area for lazy belayers and bystanders to soak in the sun.  The relatively high elevation and ability to find shady areas makes this an ideal summer crag for those hanging out in Eastern Oregon.  Most people wait till the snow melts (usually April) to venture up the gravel roads.   \n\n  These days the crag gets fairly crowded on the weekends with an influx of climbers from Walla Walla and Portland but usually climbers can still get a secluded feel by skipping the first talus field."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":133,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:25.319Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:58.626Z"}
