Start on a jug undercling, and move up through sharp holds to a massive and height dependent move to a left hand sloper. Keep it together and top out with ease. This line offers super cool movement and is close to the car, making it a fun outing if Smith Rock’s small bouldering circuit is too boring. ","protection":"2-4 pads","location":"Start standing on a jug undercling flake.
