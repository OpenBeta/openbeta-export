Start on a jug on the left and climb up through overhanging big holds and sidepulls to a refrigerator block, then rest on top of the block on jugs and prepare for the thin section up top. Already 10 feet off the deck, half-pad crimps and a sloper will lead you to a final jug at 20 feet, then bigger holds to top this dream out.Â First scouted this line in the spring of '21, ran a few laps on it on a toprope I threw down. Came back in the fall with a bunch of pads and a crew of spotters, and fired the rig. Could I have sunk 2-3 bolts in it? Yea. But with a nice flat landing and great exposure I knew that highballing this line was the way to go. ","protection":"many pads, spotters","location":"Located along the bluff, downstream of the power lines. When you're on the trail, look for a trail that heads up and right through some brush to this nice flat landing below the climb.
