Formerly known as Squaw Creek. NO VISIBLE CHALK shall be left on the boulders. Brush your ticks and chalk marks or use color matching chalk. Access is delicate and the utmost concern should be given to leaving no trace.  \n\nADMIN NOTE: Please note that access has been problematic here in the past, and local climbers are encouraged to keep a really low profile... It is a culturally sensitive area and could easily be shut down like the house cave was if people start ticking holds and trampling out vegetation with heavy padding. So please, please use caution and refrain from using chalk when possible, and brush your chalk off when done, and keep a low profile, and pick up after yourself! This place could easily be shut down if not taken care of."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:29.152Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:22.740Z"}
