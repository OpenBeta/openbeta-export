This area climbs on both sides of a dried basalt river canyon. The climbs are all on cliff-band basalt, have flat sandy landings and nice jug top-outs. Prepare to see dirt bikes and a guy with a pack of dogs rolling by on a fat tire bike (no joke, a private land owner next to the area runs a dog kennel business out of his property). The sun shines on both sides of the canyon depending what time of the day you go."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:29.152Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:05.211Z"}
