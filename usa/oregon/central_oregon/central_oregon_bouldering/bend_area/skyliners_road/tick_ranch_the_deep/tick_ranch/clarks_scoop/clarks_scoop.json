The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because a variation of about the same grade is attached to it.\n\n Starts on the obvious two hand rail in the right-center of the face. Move left into a low crux reaching (lunging) for the arete. Make a couple easier moves before encountering a tricky-ish sequence just before the lip which makes this feel taller than it is. The upper crux may be finding the best holds to use.....they are up there! Bonus points for starting lower to the right but IMO it only detracts from this sweet line.\n\n There is also a really fun variation that shares the same start but goes up the right arete for a move or two before joining Clarks Scoop near the top. It involves the use of your thumbs and a big span.","protection":"2 pads","location":"On the trail at the end of Tick Ranch"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5f05ed84-1a18-52d9-b8cf-77f8fd01e061,e7aeefae-15e1-5de7-a395-a48727784e98,a38072c9-2ef9-5fc9-b616-78d26e54495f,fc4a537b-1e2a-5c93-98ce-1c4236e5c976,f4b7f92f-aa42-518d-a6aa-0cf1a9534180,9a1ed835-8181-5599-8287-79e50ea996d6,a36c5eff-7643-5abc-a623-a82ef943b589,fda75415-3555-5a3c-84ab-d56b88b8f21c","pathTokens":["USA","Oregon","Central Oregon","Central Oregon Bouldering","Bend Area","Skyliners Road","Tick Ranch / The Deep","Tick Ranch","Clark's Scoop"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.41846,44.05263]},"bbox":[-121.41908565646534,44.052180339818136,-121.41783434353465,44.05307966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119025767","area_id":"/adUFTVVWjyEq9VriLjyHA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.41908565646534,44.052180339818136],[-121.41783434353465,44.052180339818136],[-121.41783434353465,44.05307966018186],[-121.41908565646534,44.05307966018186],[-121.41908565646534,44.052180339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"The last small cluster on the trail. \n\n Home to the classic Clark's Scoop and Split Brain"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:29.930Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:51.147Z"}
