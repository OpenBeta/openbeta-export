And a traverse has been done from \"Cave Left\" going right to \"Crimps\", although the massive ledge in the middle takes out some of the excitement.Directly uphill is another boulder with a traverse called \"Backslapper\", about V6. The stand-up finish (sw arete) is about V4.Â There are dozens more established problems at the Tick Ranch that didn't make the guidebook, as they are a little harder to find.
