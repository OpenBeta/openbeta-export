The state park is a awesome place to check out regardless if you want to swim, paddle board, fish or climb. There are tons of potential boulders and a handful of potential climbs. Rock quality is definitely mixed, almost everything i have touched is welded tuff with lots of pockets. Unfortunately i have hiked a lot to find out some of the rock is way too fragile to pull on."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:22.830Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:10.804Z"}
