None of what's actually climbed is listed. The south side, where the approach hits the wall, contains three sport routes and a treacherous though enticing crack climb. It appears that the two sport routes on the reddish slab continue into wicked overhanging extensions above. If you continue rightward around the wall you'll find the east face, which features one easy, low angle, 5th-class scramble to the top. As you drop back down to the north side, a few bolted lines through interestingly-featured rock reveal themselves. Further along is a striking finger-to-tips crack. Further still is a deep chimney and the king-line arete which may or may not be bolted as of yet (this may be an extension from the furthest left route on the south side). Here you'll find yourself amongst some interesting boulders, which you'll navigate to get back to the base of the south wall. \n\n  Seriously intriguing bouldering options abound as well, wherever you look. It just might be a bit of a chore to lug a mat out there in the typically windy conditions."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:59.676Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:38.640Z"}
