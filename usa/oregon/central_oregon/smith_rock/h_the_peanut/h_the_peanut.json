Popism feels quite hard for the grade which is probably due to having all the strenuous climbing crammed into a scant twenty-five feet of rock.  Good hands and good feet are plentiful but one will rarely have both at the same time until rounding the blunt arÃªte.  Start on the far right edge of The Peanut.  Work the right edge of the block with your right hand.  Marginal holds will soon appear on the face.  Make a short traverse left to get to some good pockets and sidepulls which will be used heavily.  I'm not going to say Popism is some forgotten gem, it's not.  Those liking bouldery 5.11's might enjoy it though. \n\n  A top-rope can easily be set up by climbing Pop Goes the Nubbin and making a short, easy traverse down and right to the Popism anchor.","protection":"4 bolts + fixed anchor.","location":"This is the furthest right route on the Peanut block."},"__v":0},{"_id":"xfFCF6jaUcOK2rW6dp5eyQ==","name":"Pop Goes the Nubbin","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Jeff Thomas, Chris Jones 1978","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.14447,44.36688]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"105789073","mp_crag_id":"105789067","climb_id":"xfFCF6jaUcOK2rW6dp5eyQ==","areaRef":"mMk51QrkUjSC6SmmL/nhrw=="},"content":{"description":"This enjoyable slab route climbs straight up the middle of The Peanut.
