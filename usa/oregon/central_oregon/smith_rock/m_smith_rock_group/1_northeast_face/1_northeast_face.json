The Struggle Within has great position, cool cruxes, requires power and endurance, has good protection, and has surprisingly good rock.     It is composed of four pitches.  All bolt recommendations are approximate: \n\n  Pitch 1 (5.11a, 11 bolts + anchors).  A mix of 5.9 to 5.10 stemming, laybacking, edging, etc. leads to a crux traverse to the left.  Sequential enough that I had to downclimb out of my dead-end and go back up to do it right.  Don't tire yourself out, you have a long way to go.  Make sure to traverse to the left two bolts before the anchor that sits straight up.  The climbing is easy by the time you can clip the last bolt, but clip it for the follower (Wish I had - sorry Jason).  Belay on a cushy ledge to the left, below a sharp flake/hand crack.   \n\n  Pitch 2 (5.11c, 11 bolts + anchors).  The best pitch of the route.  Conserve energy by climbing efficiently in the crack, and tackle a powerful roof.  From here, edge and pocket your way for the other half of the route.  Belay at a tight perch.  Pumpy and cool as hell. \n\n  Pitch 3 (5.8, 6 bolts, 1 red or yellow camalot (hand sized) + anchors).  Decent climbing and awesome position, but it's on mossy rock.  The distance between bolts, combined with the moss give it a touch of seriousness, but it's not that bad. \n\n  Pitch 4 (5.11d, 11 bolts + anchors).  The hardest and most incredible pitch.  I preferred the second to this one, but this one is exciting for the higher level of difficulty.     Start on a crumbling, frightening arete/face, and run it out between good bolts on mostly good holds.  This will put you below the roof.    Pulling the roof is the hardest section, but the crux of the route is surely holding it together for the headwall.  It's difficult to tell what holds are solid and what aren't, and it is a long pitch requiring thought.  Some of these moves may be 5.10+ or 5.11-.  A great pitch that will, in time, clean up nicely and feel like Lion Zion, only with an 11+ move in the middle.     Above the hardest climbing, the angle kicks back.  The final run to the anchor is easy climbing, but kind of freaky.  At one point, you don't have a solid hold for either of your hands or feet, and are about twenty feet run-out.  I think you could get a hand sized cam in up there, but I didn't have one with me. \n\n  A good comparison is Gulag Archipelago, one of the best multi-pitch routes at Smith, but this route has better position, harder cruxes, and is significantly more sustained.  Its black eye is imperfect rock - but with good bolts, that just makes it more exciting, right?  A great adventure sport route.","protection":"Bolts and bolted anchors.  15 or so draws with some long slings for anchors.  Bring two 60's to rap off.   You could bring a red and yellow camalot to protect the start of the 5.8 pitch and the end of the 11d pitch, but you probably won't kill yourself if you don't.","location":"On the Smith Summit spire of the Northeast Face of the Smith Rock formation.  Hike to Phoenix Buttress, and turn back towards Asterisk Pass for perhaps a hundred feet.  Beyond the big gully, you'll find a cluster of bolted routes where this one starts.     Start on the flakes and sidepulls (left hand route), and go left at every opportunity.   You'll need two 60's to get down the fourth pitch.  It's physical to pull the ropes from the final pitch, and very tricky getting them down from the 2nd rappel.  Be careful where your rope runs while you are rappelling on this pitch, and be prepared to lead back up. Once at the top of the 2nd pitch, we did one more 55 meter rappel to the ground.  Obviously, leave sufficient time to descend - the potential to epic on the descent is there.     Because you are rapping straight down the route, it is possible to bail at any time."},"__v":0},{"_id":"DqrMwnwaVOWP0+qJSGa9lg==","name":"Snibble Tower","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"1969 - John Marshall & John Haek","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.14739,44.36442]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"105923678","mp_crag_id":"105826813","climb_id":"DqrMwnwaVOWP0+qJSGa9lg==","areaRef":"kZZKBP5dWMaWEhs1KFnjjw=="},"content":{"description":"A true Smith classic, really solid old school 5.9, a bit of rotten rock, small runouts and a little bit of aid.

Expect long pitches of pebbling, with shiny new bolts everywhere, and only occasional run-outs.   As of now (early 2010), the route still suffers from poor rock.  On the bright side, some sections of Smith feel as though they will never be clean, but this isn't one of them.  With a dozen more ascents (or one ascent specifically for cleaning), this route will likely be solid, and completely amazing.  Bring helmets, call \"rock\", and be comforted by the fact that almost all pitches wander a bit away from the belay.  The first pitch may never be very good, but the rest should clean up nicely.   It was a mistake to climb this route in the winter without adequate clothing, but that was not clear until we were high on the wind-whipped wall and psychologically committed to finishing. Retreat was physically possible, but unthinkable.   For us, Season's Change was a formidable route, and worth the time.  In better conditions, it may have been enjoyable, but the brutal conditions, and the necessity of rising to the boldness of the route were more than adequate substitutes for joy.  A great adventure sport route, with the safety of modern hardware. \n\n  All bolt numbers are approximate - bring extra draws and a runner or two.   Pitch 1 (10a): 7 bolts.  Make your way over a couple of big lumps, clip at 20 feet, and then execute a miserable traverse.   Pitch 2 (10b): 12 bolts.  Step left from the belay, and then launch onto the long, pebbled face with a low and a high crux.  The top of this pitch has the only completely seated belay.  All others are hanging, or partially hanging.   Pitch 3 (10+/11-): 11 bolts.  Straight above the last pitch, power your way through a series of tough moves on difficult to spot holds in a bulge, and then rejoice on jugs on the face above. Finally, work through one of the easier sections of climbing to the base of the fourth pitch.  Watts gives this 10c, but the crux moves are harder than that.   There's another pitch that starts up the left side; ignore it and attack the bulge/overhang.   Pitch 4 (11b): 12 bolts.  The crux pitch, and unfortunately, it isn't the cleanest.  The crux is right off the belay, but it is fairly sustained for another fifty feet.  Take care on the easier upper section - this is one of the dirtier parts of the whole cliff, and more than one hold exploded in my face.   If I remember right, there is also a pitch heading up left from the base of this pitch - take the line on the right.   Pitch 5 (10a): 4 bolts.  A fun traverse on good rock, with a momentarily baffling crux at the end.  Thankfully, the tight bolting makes for a stress-free follow.  Awesome exposure!   Pitch 6 (10c): 12 bolts.  Another long pitch of pebbling and edging, this pitch could really use some cleaning.  The belay at the top is heavenly, with amazing views of the main area, monkey face, and beyond.","protection":"Bolts, and bolted belay anchors.  A couple long slings will reduce rope drag on the occasional zigzag.

The easiest approach: hike past the main area, to the Pheonix buttress.  At the Pheonix buttress, follow the cliffline back for a few hundred feet.  The route starts vertically, and then on a leftward leaning flake in the center of the face described.    There are three routes on the face: a 5.9 start in a groovy sort of thing on the left, this one in the center, and a 10a R that starts in a crack on the right. \n\n  Descent: A couple options here.  1) Apparently, you can hike uphill, around the platform and arrowhead, and then scramble down a scree gully, then back to Asterisk Pass.  We couldn't find this way.   2) Make you way downhill (3rd-4th class), back towards Sky Ridge, then look to your left (west) along the ridge for a rap anchor.  This is the descent for \"Wherever I May Roam\".  The first rappel passes a line of bolts, and then a pair of naked bolts.  Go a little further to a pair of bolts with links, in a little nook in the rock.  The second rappel can drop you to one of two sets of anchors (I am told). The ones on the left, on a small ramp, are 1/2 inch bolts.  My partner tells me there are better bolts, with links, to the right.  One more rappel takes you to the ground.

A four pitch 5.10 sport route at Smith?  This place is turning into a multi-pitch sport destination.  I know of few other places in the US that have such a high concentration of multi-pitch sport bolted routes than the Smith Rock Group.  That said, there's always something a little spicy about them, and this route is no exception.   An easy approach, great bolting, good rock (except the last pitch), and reasonable moves make Lost in Space one of the more accessible routes that tops out the formation.     All bolt counts are approximate.   Pitch 1 (8 bolts): 5.6.  Follow the bolts up the chimney and onto the fin to the left.  Pass the first anchors, and belay on top of the big ledge.   Pitch 2 (6 bolts): 10b.  Crank sloping edges up a vertical/slightly overhanging wall for ten feet, and finish on an easy slab.  Fun pitch. Give it to the more thuggish partner.     Pitch 3 (10 bolts): 10a.  The best pitch of the route, I thought.  Connive your way through tricky edges for a long way.  Nicely bolted, fun moves, and most of the rock is quite solid.  Enjoy the nice belay ledge at the top, and maybe set yourself up so you are sitting under the overhang.  This will help protect you from rockfall on the last pitch.   Pitch 4 (10 bolts): 5.9. Starting this pitch, you think, \"Oh, this isn't so bad.\"  Just give it time- you will change your mind.  Thankfully, the bolt line meanders, so you aren't climbing directly above your partner for the whole thing.  There is still a chance of braining your partner, though, so be careful, and everyone needs a helmet. \n\n  Just a thought, it might be possible to cheat right after the third pitch into the gully.  You would want to belay this procedure, and it could be completely heinous.  As dirty as the final pitch is, I think it's worth it so that you get to top out. \n\n  Even with the last pitch detractor, this route is more than worth doing.

Easiest approach is to go to Asterisk Pass, and then traverse left along the base past White Satin, etc.   I think the easiest descent is to do three single rope (60m) rappels down Wherever I May Roam.  Top out, and find the descent gully, which is just below the top.  It leads towards Asterisk Pass.
