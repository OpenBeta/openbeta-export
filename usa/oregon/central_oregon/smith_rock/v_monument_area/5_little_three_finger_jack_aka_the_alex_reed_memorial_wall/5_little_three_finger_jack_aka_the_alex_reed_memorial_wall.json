Rest assured, once you’ve climbed through the once chossy rock, the climbing breaks way to juggy/slopey/crimpy red patina goodness.There are 9 established routes with independent anchors on The Alex Reed Memorial Wall. The routes on the right side of the wall are characterized by a 4 tiered roof system. Those routes climb directly through or around the 4 roofs. The left side of the L3FJ features longer routes that climb through punchy crux sections clearing bulges and roofs, and all climb through the amazing red patina slab midway up the wall. \n\nThis wall gets sun all day. It’s one of the first towers to go in the sun over in the Monument area and one of the first to go back in the shade. By 9am it’s in full sun and goes back into the shade at 5pm (during the summer). Definitely a great winter time wall.
