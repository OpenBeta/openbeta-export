If you've never heard of or seen it, go to the Crooked River Bridge (aka Rex T Barber Bridge) on Highway 97 and look NE.  The Poplar is the unbelievable looking spire on the nearest Ridge.  The inexplicably tiny base of stone that supports the massive, leaning pillar at once defies logic and gravity.  This thing simply HAS to be climbed! \n\n  The rock is not what you would call \"good\", but since you will be chimneying, you should probably be ok.  Remember to use opposition at all times, and don't pull straight down or out on anything.  Your efforts will be rewarded with a summit register which includes the names of such legendary pioneers as Jeff Thomas.","protection":"The route is pretty well protected for this sort of thing.  The back of the chimney will take cams from fingers to #3 Camalot.
