Expect to have to make some 5.10 moves above pretty small gear in soft rock. \n\n  Pitch 1: The West Face. Either french free up the right hand bolt ladder until you can climb the pinned out tips crack or start via Sheer Trickery to the left at '12c.'  Sheer Trickery is stout.  Once in the crack, start by pulling through some easier moves on slightly suspect gear. As the gear improves, the difficulty increases, culminating in a punchy sequence of finger and tips locks on an immaculate, slabby splitter.  Once above the crux, continue up a shallow off-set with less than stellar rock quality past some bolts.   \n\n  After clipping the second bolt you have a choice:  the Watts guide recommends climbing straight up the bolts to the large ledge (the traditional West Face anchor) and then beginning the second pitch by  climbing up and left on bolts around the arete to access the North Face crack.  This is not your best choice as the bolts are old, the leader will be out of sight on the second pitch, and your rope is running over the arete.  A better alternative is to clip the second bolt after the offset with a long sling and traverse left via thin edging to the arete.  Once established on the arete, you can clip a bolt and are poised to balance up a slightly licheny slab directly below the North Face anchor. \n\n  35m, 12c (sandy) or 12a A0 \n\n  Pitch 2: If you went left early, simply climb the North Face as is described elsewhere on here.  If you went straight up to the West Face ledge, climb past four older bolts up and left on the arete until you can step around to access the North Face crack.  As has been said, this pitch is long and pumpy.  No move is really that hard, but it feels endless.  In terms of pro, there are two ways to look at this pitch:  You can protect with bomber gear every 10-20' (standard Smith Rock bolt spacing) or you can try and fiddle in thinner/more marginal gear in addition to/between the good placements.  It's easy to burn a lot of energy trying to protect this pitch.   60m, 12a \n\n  Pitch 3: From the West Face Cave, climb on bolts through very steep terrain out of the cave.  This is the 3rd pitch of Monkey Space.  If the second comes off in the wrong spot, they might not be able to get back to the wall.  Plan accordingly.   25m, 11b \n\n  Descent:  It's possible to rappel from the two bolt anchor on the right side of the floor of the Mouth (just below the beginning of the 'panic point pitch') back to the base of the route with a single 70m.

It's possible to start at the very base of the tower using the Sheer Trickery approach, but rumor has it Sheer Trickery is harder than the crux pitch of the Backbone (and considering the fire power of the FA group - Wolfgang Gullich, Ron Kauk, and Alan Watts - it's easy to believe). \n\n  The most expedient approach is to traverse the 5.6 choss band from below the start of Spank the Monkey.  Once on the arete, you will likely be a bit nauseated by the exposure, so you might want to take it bolt to bolt the first time up.  The crux pitch starts out pretty casual with some ultra-exposed and reachy 5.11 edging.  After 4 bolts or so, the North Face flake crack splits out to the left.  Get a good rest here, then tackle the first technical crux.  It's possible to 'cheat' past this first crux by climbing on the left side of the arete, and reaching around the corner to clip.  The bolt line is recommended for a pure ascent, but since you get a full recovery before the real crux, the left variation probably does little to affect the route's overall difficulty. \n\n  Another excellent rest on the left side of the arete allows you to depump for the final dynamic, airy and overhanging crux section: a rising traverse from the left arete to the right, up the widest part of the narrow face.  There's no way to climb around this section!  Once you reach the right arete the business is over, and a few easy moves lead to a no-hands rest and optional anchor. \n\n  The 3rd pitch goes at a terrifying 12a.  If it were 12c, you would have the option of dogging it and working out the moves like on P2, but since its \"only\" 12a, you're pretty much obliged to go for the onsight, which is a tad spicy to say the least.  This pitch starts out pretty steep with good holds, but gives way to some mossy slab climbing. \n\n  Once in the west cave, two exits are possible.  The pure line begins with a jump to the first hold, and attacks a steep line of jugs straight above the backbone.  Or you can always slink out the 11b Monkey Space exit to the left. \n\n  The crux pitch is probably the easiest 5.13 at Smith, but with all the exposure, you likely won't complain too much.","protection":"Bolts.
