Use the lowest end of the boulder near the trees.","protection":"None","location":"From Monkey Face, walk downhill towards Kiss of the Lepers Buttress and towards the river on the river trail. Once you reach the bottom of the trail, it's just about two minutes walk to reach the Monkey Boulder. \n\n  With your back to the river and facing the boulder, start just to the left of the tree located on the right side."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:57.648Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:57.648Z"},{"_id":"4TO2EqNEXC65J77XoOo2DA==","name":"Anus Cling","yds":"V1-","grades":{"vscale":"V1-","yds":"V1-","font":"5-"},"fa":"Matthew Beer 2021","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":true,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.14255,44.3659]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"120876413","mp_crag_id":"116549150","areaRef":"H3Uyx1J8WQOwRCcAeQxZtQ=="},"content":{"description":"If you walk down to the river near Phoenix Wall, there's a nice little beach situation when the water is low, and in between two boulders(that are shaped like butt cheeks), you can hop down and do this tiny but enjoyable little V1.
