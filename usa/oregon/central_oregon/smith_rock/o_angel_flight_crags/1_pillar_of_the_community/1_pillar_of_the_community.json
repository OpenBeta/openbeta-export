Ascends a perfect north facing corner with great views of the Cascade range. Perfect stone and perplexing movement. A bit more bouldery than the usual route.  \n\n  Begins with a savage intro boulder problem that would go at v11 in its own right, where you must wrestle a steep double arete, tossing between terrible holds. You get a brief shake in this steep portion prior to tackling the exit v7 boulder problem. From there you have an excellent mid 12 arete to the summit.","protection":"7 bolts and anchors","location":"Just up hill from help liberation there's a small deer trail.
