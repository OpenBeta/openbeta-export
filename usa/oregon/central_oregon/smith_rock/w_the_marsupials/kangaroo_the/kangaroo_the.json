While being one of the most accessible features in the marsupials, it only gets a couple ascents a year. A few easy adventure routes lead to the top, but a majority of the rock on the Kangaroo is impressively difficult looking and not yet developed. This will more than likely host some of Smith Rocks hardest sport climbs in the future."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:00.120Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:39.746Z"}
