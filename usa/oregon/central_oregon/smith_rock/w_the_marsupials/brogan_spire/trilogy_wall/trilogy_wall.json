All the first half of the routes are very approachable for the grade. 15 meters of moderate climbing leads to 10-12 meters of cruxy climbing on the steep upper headwall. The first half has great quality stone that is highly featured with thoughtful sequences. Enjoy the lower half before things turn on quickly. The upper headwall is steep, crimpy, balancy and powerful all in one! Climbers are going to have to bring a full set of skills to succeed on this wall. Oh, and did i forget to say things are a bit spaced! Theres some BIG whip potential on this wall.  \n\n  The wall stays in the shade all day for most of the year. When the sun rises high in the summer, this wall gets morning sun till about 10am or 11am. Gets great exposer to wind, so its best to climb here is the late spring - early fall"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:24.466Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:56.706Z"}
