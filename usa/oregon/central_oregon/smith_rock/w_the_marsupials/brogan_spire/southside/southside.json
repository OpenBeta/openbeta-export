The West Face, even at 5.5, scares people off regularly.  It's probably because the rock is worst, and steepest at the very beginning of the route.  By no means would I say, \"Don't worry about that, it gets safer\".  If you are frightened by the start, don't go on.  But if 5.5X sounds alright, this is a great route.  Perhaps the only 5.5X in the Marsupials that can compete with it is the South Buttress of Brogan (ha ha).     But seriously, if you can abide with the runouts, this route is really fun.  It's got almost entirely solid rock (just keep an eye out and you'll see the bad stuff), really fun moves, and great position.  What's more, it's a long route, and ends on a cool summit. \n\n  It is a bit odd calling it a trad route, because it has no gear, and pretty much the only protection is provided by bolts, but then, I would never describe it as a sport route.","protection":"You won't need much.  Pretty much just stuff to clip into the bolted anchors, and the (very) occasional bolt along the way.  Bring nuts for the last section leading to the summit.","location":"The West Face of Brogan starts by the notch at the downhill side of the Spire.  The easiest descent (I think): Descend via the Cave Route by rapping off the summit.  Rap again down the corner of the Cave Route's second pitch.  Pass through the hole of the Cave Route, walk fifty feet across flat ground, and set up one more short rappel to the ground.

The first pitch, beginning at the Juniper snag, is mostly low angle face climbing that meanders up the back side of the buttress.  Follow the line of weakness, and you'll be fine.  Expect no protection.   The route angle will flatten out, and you will find yourself at the bottom of a short section of exposed vertical rock.     With your left leg hanging over the abyss, find the solution jug, and mantle your way to another flat section, which seems to pass over a tunnel through the rock (though it's hard to tell from the top).  [Note: this is not mentioned in the Watts book- there is probably an easier line, but this way looked really nice].   From there, follow the line of least resistance to the awesome spire summit, where you will find rap anchors.     For me, the first pitch was reminiscent of the final pitch of the Traveller's Buttress at Lover's Leap: long, exposed, with solid knobs and edges. Pass through or over tunnels, around corners, and enjoy the creative routefinding in truly three dimensional terrain on both this and the adjacent Cave Route (South Buttress is much better, I think).     Most pleasant is the varied, somewhat athletic approach, incredible views of the sisters, broken top, and bachelor, an awesome summit, and all with no one around.  Dreamy.   ","protection":"I'd bring a set of nuts and a couple of slings.  Don't bog yourself down, you won't be able to place any of it anyway.  Sixty meter rope.","location":"Take a right after the bridge at the bottom of the approach hill, and follow the river around the bend.   Pass the Monument, the miraculous The Product (except for the excessive sika, for shame!), a cool sculpted trail in a suspended rock slide, and the old climber's camp on your right.  At a stretcher and sign postings, head uphill (two ways, left is easier), and make your way up onto the closed dirt road.  Emerge slowly onto the road, taking care not to surprise the rattlers, or the horses (sorry, ma'am).  Make your way uphill on the road, and pass the Koala (climb Round River to warm up). Chimney your way through the pass on the downhill side of Brogan Spire, descend a short slab, and hike up hill until you find a \"burnt out Juniper snag\"(Watts).  The route begins here on the vertical stuff, and becomes low angle within twenty feet.   \n\n  The easiest way to get down seems to be to rappel the Cave Route.  A sixty meter rope should make the belays, though I used a forty five, and down-climbed a fifteen foot section of dirty rock (not recommended)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"FN4tbhoBVBK8+VTKzzJ5rw==","name":"Smash the Silence","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.12383,44.3687]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"113483005","mp_crag_id":"118897491","climb_id":"FN4tbhoBVBK8+VTKzzJ5rw==","areaRef":"CKFbPLuxX7iVSInG6MwVNQ=="},"content":{"description":"A single route ascends the main spire's south wall.
