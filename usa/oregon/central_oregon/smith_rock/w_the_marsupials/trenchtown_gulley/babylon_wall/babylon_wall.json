A good spot for those looking for a secluded day of climbing without having to sacrifice lots of quality hard routes to try, even during peak climbing season on the weekend.\n\n While the climbing is on par with most walls at Smith, the hike will surely detour any crowds. It can also be tricky to get reliable temps up there. The shade appears around 3pm during the middle of summer. The spring and fall are the best, but the weather is less predictable. The winter sun doesn't really hit the wall making it a bad spot for winter climbing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":8,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:24.465Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:42.307Z"}
