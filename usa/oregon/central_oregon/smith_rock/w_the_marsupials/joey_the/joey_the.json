Also, this is a sport route but by sport I mean one single bolt to the anchor. The climbing is easy and the rock is sub par depending on who you ask but good holds are available the whole way. The only move that requires attention has that single new bolt right at your chest. Anchors at the top are not the old slings you see.","protection":"One bolt, anchor and chains on top. You can clip a second bolt on an adjacent route right when you reach the notch about 20 feet off the deck. Rap or deal with potential heavy drag when pulling the rope.","location":"The route starts at the base of the notch between the kangaroo and the joey on the southwest side(hence the name). Scramble up easy 4th class to the base of the notch and belay from there. A bolt is on the ledge for any uncomfortable belayer. "},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:59.405Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:59.405Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5f05ed84-1a18-52d9-b8cf-77f8fd01e061,e7aeefae-15e1-5de7-a395-a48727784e98,f3c655b6-9c95-597f-aaa6-fd7d8a4865ec,6c1a61fb-128b-5f3f-8c6a-c54e4e2bcdbf,f6fbd657-7d3c-5aa5-aab2-4ade604a1fcb","pathTokens":["USA","Oregon","Central Oregon","Smith Rock","(w) The Marsupials","Joey, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.12435,44.36647]},"bbox":[-121.12497899916038,44.36602033981815,-121.12372100083962,44.36691966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114264318","area_id":"9vvWV308WqWqskreYEofyw=="},"content":{"description":"This is the shorter of the two spires accompanying the kangaroo.
