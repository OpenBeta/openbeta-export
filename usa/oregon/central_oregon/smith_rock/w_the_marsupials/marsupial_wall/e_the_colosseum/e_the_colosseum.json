Just like any other classic at Smith, the crux of this route travels through the best rock on the route; it’s powerful, cryptic and hard. Clear the crux section and keep making moves up and right. At the end of the first pitch lies a redpoint crux. Pull those last moves and clip the first pitch anchors above.\n\n P2. 5.11d Pitch 2 starts out up a perfect slab of volcanic tuff. Crimps, tiny edges and perfect finger pockets characterize this amazing pitch. While seemingly not having a defined crux section, this 8 bolt section of route climbs consistent with the grade through every move. A must do pitch if climbing this route!\n\n P3. 5.10 Pitch 3 is the summit pitch that leads to the top of the cliff. After climbing the amazing stone on pitch 2, prepare to deal with some crumbly stuff on pitch 3. While not the best climbing of the route, this pitch does lead up and left to the summit of the cliff. After reaching the top of the Colosseum Wall, take in a perfect view of Smith Rock and the Cascades just beyond.\n\n This route was one of Alex’s last routes he developed with Alan Collins before his untimely passing. Unfortunately Alex never got to send this amazing line. I feel honored to have been able to fill those shoes and help establish this great route with Alan. Thank you Alex for everything you’ve done at Smith Rock.","protection":"P1: 12 bolts\n\nP2: 8 bolts\n\nP3: 10 bolts\n\nFixed anchors","location":"Colosseum Wall, Marsupials"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5f05ed84-1a18-52d9-b8cf-77f8fd01e061,e7aeefae-15e1-5de7-a395-a48727784e98,f3c655b6-9c95-597f-aaa6-fd7d8a4865ec,6c1a61fb-128b-5f3f-8c6a-c54e4e2bcdbf,071f77bc-5738-5265-856b-68c6083109c2,1d394a6e-3626-55d3-b5df-388e0366617e","pathTokens":["USA","Oregon","Central Oregon","Smith Rock","(w) The Marsupials","Marsupial Wall","(e) The Colosseum"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.13"},{"count":3,"label":"5.13b"},{"count":3,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13b/c"},{"count":4,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"},{"count":2,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.13c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":22,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":11,"expert":11}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":11,"expert":11}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.12153,44.36649]},"bbox":[-121.12215899937515,44.36604033981813,-121.12090100062484,44.36693966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114603670","area_id":"HTlKbjYmVdO13ziOA2Zhfg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.12215899937515,44.36604033981813],[-121.12090100062484,44.36604033981813],[-121.12090100062484,44.36693966018186],[-121.12215899937515,44.36693966018186],[-121.12215899937515,44.36604033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"This giant looking wall is actually only 200ft at its tallest although it looks bigger. Most routes have extensions in the works, with a vision that single pitch 60m routes will voyage to the top when they run straight enough. Those that don't stay straight enough can be done as a multi-pitches. Grades range from 5.12a through 5.13b. Vertical technical smith climbing dominates most of the wall, some steep section with give a good variety to the wall. The walls most iconic and eye catching feature is the \"Alex Reed Memorial Route\". A proud multi-pitch charging up to the top of the entire cliff in 3 pitches. The second pitch goes through a headwall of perfect rock that is unique to the park! \n\n  The wall stays in the shade till 1pm in the summer. In the winter, the wall gets sun around 12pm. A good wall to climb at year around."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":22,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:24.465Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:42.334Z"}
