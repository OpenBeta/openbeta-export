Most of the climbing rock is generally solid, but the the top of the cliffs are commonly loose. \n\n  A top-rope anchor could be made with trad gear in cracks at the top of many routes, BUT due the short nature of the climbs, soft sandy landings, and common loose rock on top of most climbs, for many climbers bouldering may be much more ideal than roped climbing. \n\n  Camping is allowed in the area, but there is no water or restrooms available in this high desert wilderness. \n\n  For an extensive overview of routes at The Drive In, check out the Falcon Guide, Rock Climbing Oregon by Adam R. Bolf and Benjamin P. Ruef.
