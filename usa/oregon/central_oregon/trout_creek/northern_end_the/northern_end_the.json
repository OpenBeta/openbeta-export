The right crack is offwidth and offset such that it forms a great place to place your back while chimney climbing. The first 50-60 feet can be chimney climbed in this manner, placing pro in the smaller left crack (5.6-5.7). Leave the security of the chimney and transfer to the left crack to harder climbing with good rests up and left to a chain anchor (5.8).","protection":"Unlike many climbs at Trout Creek, this climb eats up nuts, I placed 3 medium offset nuts on it and could have placed more.  Also bring a set of cams to 2\" or 3\" with emphasis on the smaller cams.","location":"This climb is to the left of Shasta which is to the left of Lively Up Yourself. It can be easily identified as a chimney route with a small crack to the left and a larger offwidth crack to the right.  The cracks are offset enough that a chimney is formed. This allows for stable stances most of the way up making it easy to place good pro."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5f05ed84-1a18-52d9-b8cf-77f8fd01e061,e7aeefae-15e1-5de7-a395-a48727784e98,9240e681-e22c-5042-8fed-070c06d4bbff,6a07f46d-150b-5e7a-bbac-4bb7f0d57183","pathTokens":["USA","Oregon","Central Oregon","Trout Creek","Northern End, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":7,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":3,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10"},{"count":6,"label":"5.9"},{"count":3,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":27,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":8,"intermediate":17,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":8,"intermediate":17,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.10752,44.803]},"bbox":[-121.10815374028954,44.80255033981815,-121.10688625971044,44.80344966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106505494","area_id":"agf0bRULXnq7rEu38NVxgw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.10815374028954,44.80255033981815],[-121.10688625971044,44.80255033981815],[-121.10688625971044,44.80344966018186],[-121.10815374028954,44.80344966018186],[-121.10815374028954,44.80255033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"The northern end is home to Trout's lower-angled, easier cracks.
