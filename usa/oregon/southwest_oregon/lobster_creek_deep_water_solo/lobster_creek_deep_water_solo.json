The water is safe below but always double check!! This bouldering area is located just below the Lobster Creek Bridge and is a known cliff jumping spot. Being said, I started cleaning the rock for at least one solid problem (deep water solo).The rock is really solid and you have to traverse your way to get to the start of the vertical climb. I'd recommend cleaning the top-out area of loose rocks/gravel prior to climbing. It's a really fun climb and you can keep your shoes dry from the start (assuming you don't fall or bail!)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:02.391Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:44.399Z"}
