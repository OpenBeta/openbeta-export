It sits 30 feet below the ridge road and uphill of Inca Rock. There are fantastic views from the rock of the valley below. However does not get climbed much since access has been restricted. The first ascent of Orphan was Jacob's Ladder (A1) made by Harold Hall and Tim Kosderka (Weyerhaeuser Forester) in 1989 and has yet to be freed. Currently there are six established routes on the Orphan range from 5.9 to 5.11b and 35 to 150 feet in length. Bolts are stainless steel and in good shape but the routes themselves predictably are in need of TLC and currently only suitable for dry summer climbing.
