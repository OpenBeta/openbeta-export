Look carefully for sparce finger jams and solid underclings while avoiding moss and loose rock. Just enough features for normal protection to avoid an R rating. Immediately below fragile flakes 25' from top, step up and right over loose blocks to a pair of bolt anchors on the highest solid rock on the face (no chains). See photo for rope and anchor positioning.

Named for its resemblance to a brick wall with all of the small right-angled cracks. Bottom portion is quite solid, smooth rock with numerous cracks, pockets, slopers, and underclings. Several loose blocks can be avoided, but top 20' is extremely fragile. Fairly dirty with moss and pine needles but easily cleaned as you climb in dry weather. Pair of anchor brackets on at least the North side (Shake it down, 5.6).  Other routes need descriptions, including the original ascent below N face anchors and any other fixed gear.
