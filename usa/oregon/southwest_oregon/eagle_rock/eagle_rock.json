Establish your fist belay. Pitch-1 (40 feet, 5.4, gear 1-2 inches with marginal rock): scramble east off the Parkway Ledge and around the corner following a narrow ledge Â for about 40 feet before the Parkway Ledge widens and returns to Class-3. Establish your next belay at an obvious 3-inch crack that climbs to the right off the wider ledge. Pitch-2 (80 feet, 5.6, gear 2-6 inches): climb a short and more difficult section to enter into a leg-jam crack on the right side of a very large chimney feature (Paul Bunyan's Chimney).
