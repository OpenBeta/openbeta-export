The Crux is the second move after starting. It’s a small jump to a mono/two finger pocket off a small sloper and crimp pocket (v3/v4). After that, you are left with some pumpy moves on a slight overhang. No specific beta after the crux move. The route is brand new as of March 2018.","protection":"Sport climbing.

There it is, a beautiful stainless steel bolt with nasty/banger glue. Now begin ascending the overhung pocket fest. Some big jugs toward the crux will help you send.

Have fun with that! Mantle the crux and then finish to the anchors.
