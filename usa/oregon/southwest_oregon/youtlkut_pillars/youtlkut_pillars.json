Bolt anchors without chains have been placed in a short headwall on top which is set back about 6 feet from the edge of the columns. Establishing a topropes requires lots of webbing or cordelette. The pillars receive afternoon sun. They are above 4400 feet so the area is typically snowed in until June or later. The pillars provide for fun but sharp columnar face and crack climbs.
