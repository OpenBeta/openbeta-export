Initially known for the fire lookout on top, it is now a place for climbers to explore climbing in a rather remote area. Acker Rock contains 20 established routes. These routes are predominately slab-friction adventure climbs that range in difficulty from 5.5 to 5.10c. Seventy percent of the routes on Acker Rock are rated 5.9 or less. Routes range on length from 80 feet to over 2,000 feet on the Peregrine Traverse. All routes are sparsely bolted by sport climbing standards, but can be backed up with a light rack covering Â½ to 4 inches. The rock is a coarse grained rhyodacitic welded tuff that has been altered through faulting. If you wish to reserve the lookout on top of the crag, you can do so online. The rental season runs from late July to November, and reservations can be made at recreation.gov/camping/campâ¦. The lookout tends to be booked quickly. The rock does contain Peregrine, which can be seen flying around throughout the year. As a friend once told me, âIf you donât see a Peregrine at Acker, you arenât paying attentionâ. Bald Eagles are also seen in the region. As a result, there is an annual closure from January 1st until July 1st. There is also an endemic buckwheat that grows throughout the rock formation."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":17,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:27.772Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:17.388Z"}
