Apparently the original name is \"The Good V3\", but I have always called it \"Left side, Strong side\", and I've introduced it to other people as that, so I'll just put both in the title for the sake of hopefully eliminating any confusion. Don't know who got the FA, so if they, or anyone else knows, feel free to comment it below. That being said, this is a solid climb at the gardens. Starts on a right facing flake and goes up to crimps and slopers. Different betas for the last reachy move, either keep bumping left hand or use some right heel scum action and/or some intermediate slopers to get there.","protection":"1-2 pads, probably a spotter as well","location":"Northeast of Octernal. If you take the second entrance to the boulders from the road, follow the path until you reach the left-hand turn for Octernal.

There are several ways to start this problem, I recommend starting on a thin right hand crimp near head height at the center of the boulder and a lower left hand side pull.

It's possible to skip an otherwise spicy top out by stepping left into a mini gully thing, you gotta stay on the rock for full value though.","protection":"","location":"Left arete on the same bolder as \"The Good\" immediately to the right of \"Next to the Good\".
