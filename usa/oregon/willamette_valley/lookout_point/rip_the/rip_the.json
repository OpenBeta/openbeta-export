Clip the lone bolt, then head up and right through a nicely twisted sequence, joining the last few moves and the last bolt of Guilded, with one lunge near the lip being a great place to punt. Despite this it might not really earn a harder grade.The reason to do it: adds a 5.12 section of really nice pocket pulls through some of the best rock quality and movement on the wall.
