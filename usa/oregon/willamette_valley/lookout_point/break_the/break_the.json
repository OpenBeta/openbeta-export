Took alot of glue and cleaning to make it climbable with some level of longevity. Likely to continue to change a bit if breakage continues. Easy to move the bolts on the extension so let me know if you have preferences. the upper bolts are temporary and it may be good to have a wrench on hand to tighten them if they're moving.This route has exhausted my willingness to glue so I probably won't bolt on this wall much more.
