Juggy intro leads straight into tricky and powerful low crux. Recover and then savor open handed slopers and pinches requiring confident footwork and strong shoulders. (5.11b)  P2 (Swallows Rest): Pull up over the bulge and continue up the face above. Good rests mixed with fairly sustained 5.10 climbing. (5.10c/d).First pitch can be belayed from the ground AND lowered to the ground with a 70m. The entire route can be climbed as one pitch from the ground with an 80m rope. 2 rappels to the ground from the top anchor. \n\n ","protection":"Bolts with rap ring anchors.","location":"Middle of Animal House between Cottonmouth and Razorback.  Shares belay anchor with Cottonmouth.  "},"__v":0},{"_id":"VSBpSmcmVky3Ylcdpvem9w==","name":"Razorback","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Aubrey Miller - 2019","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.7481,43.84628]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"120676207","mp_crag_id":"120664043","climb_id":"VSBpSmcmVky3Ylcdpvem9w==","areaRef":"sNrxyQclUYG5FJnj13FVRg=="},"content":{"description":"P1: begins at rightmost belay station and heads straight through slopers, side pulls and fun powerful moves straight up to a ledge.P2: much easier, Follow the arete to rap ring anchors (5.10a).2 raps to the ground.","protection":"Anchors and chains","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5f05ed84-1a18-52d9-b8cf-77f8fd01e061,06ef0169-1ce2-5f05-ba4d-46ee7e66e2c7,71841168-6bac-5e23-bf65-52e7cdd8d855,b0daf1c9-0725-5181-b914-99e3d7715546","pathTokens":["USA","Oregon","Willamette Valley","Eagles Rest","(D) Animal House"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.7481,43.84628]},"bbox":[-122.74872348808505,43.845830339818136,-122.74747651191494,43.84672966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120664043","area_id":"sNrxyQclUYG5FJnj13FVRg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-122.74872348808505,43.845830339818136],[-122.74747651191494,43.845830339818136],[-122.74747651191494,43.84672966018186],[-122.74872348808505,43.84672966018186],[-122.74872348808505,43.845830339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"The obvious black wall just right of Dream Wall directly in front of the large uprooted tree."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:28.767Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:19.230Z"}
