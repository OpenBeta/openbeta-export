When the angle kicks back even more, belay from a pair of old bolts (these are also the top anchors for Apache Acid) or scramble about 30 feet higher and belay from a pair of glue-ins.  It took almost all of a 70m rope to reach the glue-ins, so I'm not sure whether you could go that far on a 60m. \n\n  A new intermediate anchor has been added, providing the option of climbing the steeper bottom section and skipping about half of the slab.","protection":"18 bolts to reach the highest anchor (two glue-ins).
