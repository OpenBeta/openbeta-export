The rock quality is mediocre (particularly on the lower half of the route) but not that bad for Oregon standard. The climbing is technically not harder than 5.8 and it's a good introduction to harder climbs in the Menagerie, but it's not a climb for novice trad climbers.Bolts on the first two pitches with a few options to add protection. Mostly good protection can be found on the last two pitches with a bit of a runout after the first bolt on pitch 3.Â Start at the notch between the rabbit ears.Pitch 1: (5.8) Climb up 25ft near the arete (2 bolts) to a ledge and traverse about 30ft (passing a few bolts and an old piton). Climb up a small groove for about 15ft to a belay below an overhang.Pitch 2:(5.8+) Climb the overhanging crack passing one bolt to a good ledge and the next belay station. This pitch is less than 30ft long and can be combined with the first pitch if the rope drag isn't too bad.Pitch3:(5.8) Traverse a few feet to the right and than straight up a fun crack system (one piton on the way). The pitch ends with a small but easy overhang with nice exposure.Pitch4:(5.7) Continue up the crack system. Climbing gets easier and easier and ends up in a scramble towards the top of the tower.DESCENT: Possible with one 70m rope but be careful. Easier with 2x 60m ropes. The in-between belay spots are ok for anchors but not set up for rapping. We double-fishermanned 2x 60m ropes and made it back to the first anchors. We set up to rap to ground easily enough but he know got stuck in a flake/crack that required reclimbing to free, so be cautious.","protection":"Full rack up to 4 inch.","location":"Start directly at the saddle between the North and South Ear."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.361Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.361Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5f05ed84-1a18-52d9-b8cf-77f8fd01e061,06ef0169-1ce2-5f05-ba4d-46ee7e66e2c7,babb4922-e35f-5351-b709-768a4d08f0f3,7e97ceac-72ed-5a38-838b-2517c4d9618a,7a365dde-5b4e-5727-9022-91bdf51a1de8","pathTokens":["USA","Oregon","Willamette Valley","Menagerie Wilderness","Rabbit Ears","South Rabbit Ear"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.30129,44.42855]},"bbox":[-122.30191966685113,44.42810033981814,-122.30066033314884,44.42899966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121167516","area_id":"ejZd3ltOVyeQIpG99Rod6A=="},"content":{"description":"300ft tower.
