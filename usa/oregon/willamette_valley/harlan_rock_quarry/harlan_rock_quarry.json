The Harlan Quarry hosts six climbs; five of which are bolted and should be considered \"sporty\" traditional bolted routes. These lie on the left (west) portion of the wall. There is one bolted aid route near the center of the crag. Due to the ample precipitation and vegetation on the slope above the quarry the routes are often wet or seeping and thus the season is short, from late spring through fall. The Rock at Harlan Quarry is sandstone altered by the intrusion of a basalt dike. Due to the abundant moisture the bolts are in poor shape and in need of upgrading. Much of the development was done by Kevin Pogue in the 1980s, while working on doctorate in structural geology at OSU, and other Corvallis climbers."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:28.221Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:03.837Z"}
