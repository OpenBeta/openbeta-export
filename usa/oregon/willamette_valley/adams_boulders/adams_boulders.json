On a typical day you'll see a couple other parties fishing in the area. The boulders sit on the west shoulder of Hills Creek Lake a stones throw from the road. Most likely they fell off the craggy choss protuberance above and/or were blasted to the shore during road construction. Their position means that they get a lot of sun, and they're usually the first boulders in the Willamette Valley to dry in winter, needing only a couple hours of good weather to be climbable. The rock feels like some sort of basalt, so it's a little slicker than nearby areas like Fisher and Tumble, but that means the rock tends to form difficult lines. There's a bathroom across the bridge if you need it.Name was changed to avoid confusion with other zones..."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:29.146Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:05.323Z"}
