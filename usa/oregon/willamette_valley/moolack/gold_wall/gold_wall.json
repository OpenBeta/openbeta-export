Easy climbing off the talus brings you to the crux all too quickly.  Power through the blank face on thin edges and locks and get established in the shallow flare above.  (it's worth rapping this with a small brush/nut tool to check that it's clean)  Funk up the flare to a perfect ledge below a beautiful zebra-striped corner.  You could easily link through, but to my knowledge, no one has as of yet.  After physical liebacking up the corner, figure out a funky crux and climb up and left into a rewarding hand crack/left facing corner above.","protection":"Gear to 3\" Bring micro gear.","location":"The middle of the wall.

The corner is capped by an 8' roof that creates one of the two cruxes of the route.  The climbing in the corner is pretty heads up.  (Similar in character to the thin climbing on X)  Despite this, the small gear is good (the rock is perfect) and you get the occasional bomber, larger-sized piece.  Belay directly above the roof on a small foot shelf.   \n\n  Above the belay, fun, moderate moves on beautiful sculpted stone spit you out at a stance below a steep splitter.  This is the second crux and an attentive belayer is recommended to keep you off the ledge.  Gear is good, but is difficult to place.  After the angle relents higher, pass a large tree and finish via the last 40' of BDF.","protection":"Gear to 3\" Heavy on the micro gear.","location":"Immediately left of Bold Deli Flavor."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5f05ed84-1a18-52d9-b8cf-77f8fd01e061,06ef0169-1ce2-5f05-ba4d-46ee7e66e2c7,ee581ded-95d6-5771-9c1d-5cdfa158c158,c09904f0-d6ec-5c2e-ad7d-d6d5239d53ad","pathTokens":["USA","Oregon","Willamette Valley","Moolack","Gold Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.14861,43.87116]},"bbox":[-122.14923374830491,43.870710339818146,-122.14798625169512,43.87160966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109894597","area_id":"wJkE8NbsXC6tfdbVI51TrQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-122.14923374830491,43.870710339818146],[-122.14798625169512,43.870710339818146],[-122.14798625169512,43.87160966018187],[-122.14923374830491,43.87160966018187],[-122.14923374830491,43.870710339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the last major buttress at the west end of the cliffband before you reach Gold Gully.
