The route opens with a few face moves on good slopers, this gets you to the crack. This is a super steep rattly fingers crack that requires solid technique and very accurate gear placement as the rock is not uniform and a tad loose, one piece of gear failure will likely result in a ground fall, the angle eases as you go up and the gear gets much better. I highly recommend bringing a long sling or bit of rope to build an anchor on the tree directly above the route and top rope this climb first as it is a quite serious lead at this time, that might change as I clean it more for now I will leave the R rating unless others feel its unnecessary.","protection":"Gear from BD0-BD#1 an extra BD.5-.75 will save your butt.

One main route currently known, the Dean Fry Memorial Route. There are two other lines that appear to have two bolts at the start, but unknown where they go, or if they are abandoned projects.    This could be a good cliff for hard summer climbing, if someone wanted to develop more sport lines.    There is also a good looking overhanging finger crack that starts about 10'-12' off the ground and goes to about 40' tall. It looks hard and sustained, and clean enough that I'm pretty sure someone has at least tried it.    If anyone knows any info on the lines here, or boulder problems, please add them or contact me!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:28.222Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:18.585Z"}
