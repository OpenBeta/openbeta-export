After the featured steeps of the hammer, climbs a sustained 20-30 degree panel, lessening to vert for the last two bolts. Likely a near full-reset rest (still in overhanging terrain though) before leaving The Hammer no matter how you slice it, but the intention was to clip the final bolt and stay in those jugs, rather than messing with the anchor up and right.Grade is a total guess. Havent put any work in, but it seems like 4-5 bolts of high end bouldering on thin pockets giving way to patina crimps, with just enough holds to definitely go. While a few isolated holds are decent enough to chalk the other hand for a bit, there are never two good, or matchable holds in close proximity so it seems like 15-20 moves of uninterrupted power-endurance will be in order. It is currently kindof sharp. I would evaluate the rock quality as \"high, for the Willamette valley\".Â If you're working it, feel free to tweak things like bolt position. all the holes were overdrilled and the studs can easily be pounded in and patched.","protection":"something like 11 bolts, stainess 3/8 wedges.

Shaped like a great maroon thunderhead, or mushroom cloud. Nearly all sides are wildly overhanging, and feature deep rusty red pocketed caprock, and more vertical, blocky intros. The grey, angular lower band of rock ranges from hard, high quality to hollow death flakes. The caprock band is high quality, softer but more compact, however it seems like it's often going to be too blank for many lines to really go. The lines of weakness are likely to be 5.12 and above.
