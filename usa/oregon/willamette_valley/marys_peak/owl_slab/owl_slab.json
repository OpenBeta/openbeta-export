The slab is composed of andesite, like Flagstone and French's Dome.  Owl Slab was given its name by Paul Waters as the result of an encounter with an owl while toproping the slab. While short, the routes on Owl Slab are fun and excellent training for aspiring sport and/or slab climbers. The routes range from 5.1 to 5.8 in difficulty. Owl Slab currently hosts seven bolted sport routes.  The four routes on the right side of the slab were bolted by Josh Norris and his crew in the winter of 2009/2010 for the Adventure Leadership Institute (ALI) Rock 2 course, while the three routes on the left side of the slab were bolted by Ben Chapman & Pam Neal in 2016. If you don't lead, you can scramble to the top of Owl Slab through the woods to the left and set up TR on the anchors. Be careful as the anchors are situated below the top."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:28.220Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:20.774Z"}
