I've personally not climbed the pillars. Supposed to be 5 different pillars around the top of the peak. If you know where they are and what the routes are, please add them.As of April 2021, pillars/walls are pretty mossy but have some potential. The main trail direct from the road leads to a rock where you can rap to the bottom of what is currently overgrown mossy rock. Alternatively, you can hike off the the right on another faint trail towards a small pillar and climb that first, there are some good moves to be had. The trail off to the side also leads down to the base of the main wall. I am working on adding some pictures and more helpful directions. Increased traffic at this location would be very good for it.
