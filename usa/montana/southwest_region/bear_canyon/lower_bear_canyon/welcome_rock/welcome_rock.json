This might be harder to climb if you are shorter than 5.9. If you follow the bolt line all the way up this runs 5.10b, if not it will run about 5.9/5.10.\n\nIf anyone has any idea who the FA is, please feel free to edit this. This route is a definent do, it is really fun and a pretty universally done crux that feels cool! It feels pretty sandy at the bottom but gets excellent up about 10 feet!","protection":"3 or 4 bolts to a chain anchor","location":"Trail to Lower Bear Canyon dumps you right at a cool looking line straight up the face.
