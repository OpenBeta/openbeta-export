Access is easiest from the left side of the main Tsunami formation, through about 50 feet of steep, loose trail. This little route consists of surprisingly good pockets in a sea of choss. Though nothing too special, is a worthwhile route if you are already in the area. The route starts steep on a pinch and smaller pockets, then evens out just over vertical on nice big jugs. This route has seen maybe 3 or 4 ascents so be mindful of loose and somewhat dirty rock.\n\nThe anchor directly to the right of High Tide is a short, unbolted project. Please be careful accessing anchors on either of these climbs if you decide to toprope them.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6d93ce9a-b1f9-55de-ba48-51d186dd1ef8,8f38b276-2760-5622-b0c2-03625573cc64,910b4de2-f730-5431-b9cd-e0a537cab3a3,013bba08-fa64-5c0e-8202-1e1ad30e922f,e146493a-b9a0-5972-a816-513ab76a8624","pathTokens":["USA","Montana","Southwest Region","Bear Canyon","Upper Bear Canyon","Tsunami Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.90875,45.59913]},"bbox":[-110.90939267081559,45.598680339818145,-110.90810732918442,45.599579660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112850578","area_id":"4UZJOrmgWXKoFlE6t2qGJA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:36.683Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:58.587Z"}
