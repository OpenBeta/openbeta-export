Pass the first ledge you come to. Good belay spot is on a little perch underneath bomber, clean rock with a finger crack 20’ above the first large bush. Save some small gear (0.3-0.4) for the belay.\n\nPitch 2: (60', 5.8)\n\nClimb the short but fantastic finger crack above the belay past some ledges, and stem up and right through the airy finish. Belay at chains.\n\nDescent:\n\nOne rappel back to ledge with 70m rope, or two rappels from midway chains.
