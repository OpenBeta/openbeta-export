Start matched in a thin hands slot / undercling in the back left side of the cave. Make a few powerful moves, utilizing grainy edges, jugs, heel hooks, and whatever else you need to do to keep your butt off the ground. Near the cave entrance, make a few more powerful moves to reach the solid plate jugs. Keep traversing left and up until you reach a topout ledge.\n\nSome of the holds (especially the feet) are a bit friable. With more traffic this could improve and bump this climb up a star. As it is, its probably worth a star and a half, mostly due to rock quality and the ass-draging (hence the name) nature of the problem. The movement is fun and makes it worthwhile, especially if you are into core intensive roof climbing!","protection":"Pads.","location":"Back left side of the cave.
