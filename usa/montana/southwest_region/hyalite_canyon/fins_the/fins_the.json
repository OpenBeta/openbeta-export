If you're using the poopy holds, you've gone slightly too far right.  The first bolt couldn't be placed in a good clipping location due to hollow rock so make sure to bring a stick clip!

Climb straight up past the Golden Hole using mostly good holds on the vertical wall.  How's it 5.12, then?  It's generally giant reaches with bad feet.  The hardest move is leaving the Golden Hole (may be height dependent), but the technasty above could easily spit you off as well.  Very beta intensive.

It breaks down into three completely different sections.  Vertical mostly jugs into perfect slab climbing (probably the crux for most) into a compression boulder problem at the top.

Be careful of slippery moss footholds.","protection":"Two nuts ranging from #10-13.
