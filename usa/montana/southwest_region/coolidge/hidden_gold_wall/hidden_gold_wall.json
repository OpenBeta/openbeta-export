A magical mantle onto the slab with little crimps in the slanting crack at chest height. Traverse out left, placing small gear in the crack. Get comfy on the small ledge by placing great gear above your head. Punch it. Cruxy face moves are protected first by the good gear mentioned and then a bolt (placed on lead). A dirty, sloping mantle to the big belay ledge is protected by a fixed pin. 5.11 A2 (possibly 5.12-?) 200' *Beware of rope drag. Maybe climb on half ropes.*\n\nP2 - Easy climbing above the belay leads to a unique 5.9 slab dihedral that is exited left via a short hands splitter.

Easy, but somewhat loose climbing leads to the mega ledge. 5.10+ 200'\n\nP3 - 5.6 leads to top of the wall\n\nDecent - Walk to the left (east).
