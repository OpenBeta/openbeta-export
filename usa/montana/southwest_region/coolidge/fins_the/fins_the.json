Every pitch is truly fantastic with massive ledges for each belay.\n\nP1 - Fun face climbing with great pro lands you at a ledge. 5.8 100'\n\nP2 - Broken face with good pro. 5.9 100'\n\nP3 - Launch up an incredible aching 5.10 finger crack. When the crack dissipates at the roof, I went left and found an un-protectable 5.11b friction stem box in a dihedral, though I now think it would have been smarter to simply climb straight through the roof. 5.11b R/X 200'\n\nP4 - Ridge scramblin! 5.8 200'\n\nP5 - Absolutely amazing splitter 5.11 fingers in a slightly over-hanging dihedral. It really doesn't get better. 5.11 100'\n\nP6 - Chimney to the ridge. Scramble the beautiful ridge to the back of the formation. 5.8/9 100'\n\nDescent - One rappel off the back of the fin via a slung block or small tree (I can't remember, but it's obvious).","protection":"Double rack to BD #3.\n\nTwo 60m ropes.","location":"This is the ridge line on the largest of the fins.
