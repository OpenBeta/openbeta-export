You could start higher up by walking out on this ledge, but you're here to climb, right? Alternate between the face and crack, passing a couple of flakes wedged into a chimney as chockstones. Finish on large ledge under a blank runout face, with a ramp going up and climbers left. Gear belay directly above the crack system.\n\nDescent:\n\nWalk off. Once on the belay ledge, hop down to the southeast and around the large belay pillar, and then walk east under the south face climbs (there will be bolts on the wall) towards a large blocky scramble chimney with a massive chockstone above it. Scramble up and under this large block, and then down the main walk off for the Queen.","protection":"Good pro the whole way. Gear up to BD#3 (a 4 helps, but not necessary to feel protected). Stoppers and micro cams handy. Belay: Sling a washing machine sized bomber pillar with the option of a piece or two of pro as well.","location":"Of the two main crack systems ascending the West face of the Queen, this is the right hand one.
