Then follow the large crack on the left to chains at the top. Very solid foot jams until the last 10 feet where the crack widens and either requires large gear to protect or good placements outside of the crack. There are a few parallel cracks that will accept smaller nuts on the right here. The crux is pulling over the top section. You may be able to walk off the top if you so choose to do so.","protection":"Standard Rack. 2 bolts with chains at the top.","location":"This is the first pitch you will see if you follow the climbers trail to the\n\nGreek Creek Crag.\n\nThe slab to the right and below\n\nFat Man's Reunion\n\n."},"__v":0},{"_id":"v+d0oG0eVT+Stxe/QKoRkQ==","name":"Fat Man's Reunion","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"John Drumheller, Scott Anderson (1986).

Continuous and aesthetic movement and great holds the whole way up. Super enjoyable.\n\nThere is the option for a second pitch. It sees far less traffic, checks in at ledgy 5.5, and adds another 15-20 meters or so. Walk off from the top of either pitch, or double rope rap the first.","protection":"If you choose to lead it on sport, this has recently been fully bolted with shiny new hardware. 8 (if I remember) bolts to crisp chains.\n\nOn gear, if you are willing to stray somewhat from the boltline, pro is very reasonable and ranges from small to medium nuts up to about a #1-#2 camalot. Great as a trad lead for beginners because if at any point you feel sketched you can just clip a bolt!","location":"Look uphill from Greek Creek and you can't miss it.
