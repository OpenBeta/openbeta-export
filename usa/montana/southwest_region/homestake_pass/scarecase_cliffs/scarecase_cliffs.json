When the crack runs out, move into a flake undercling (slightly flexy), clip the first bolt, and launch into superb, technical, and abrasive face climbing above. The climbing gradually builds to a crux at the end characterized by a big lock-off to a poor hold just before reaching the ledge two thirds of the way up the face.\n\nNote: The anchors of this climb can be reached to set up a top-rope by building an anchor off of the red hangers atop the feature and rappelling down to the midway ledge.\n\nFor those looking for a challenge, an extension/second pitch (Tabulae Rasae) may be possible. This potential extension begins with desperate laybacking up the right side arete capped by a burly boulder problem that brings you back onto the face and up a thin seam to the top. This extension is not bolted but can be top-roped by building an anchor off of the aforementioned red hangers atop the feature. Probably 5.13.
