The problem follows a zig zag of slanting finger seams to a jug and a nice top out. Start low right and work the thin finger seam up and left to a hole. From there find the small side pull that will help you reach the jug and finish with an easy top out. Walk off to the right.","protection":"One crash pad","location":"This boulder is found at the edge of Mason Lake proper. Take the 1.3 mile trail to the lake. Take the obvious left hand path along the edge of the lake 30 yards to a steam crossing. The boulder is on the other side of the stream just beyond a few trees and smaller boulders.
