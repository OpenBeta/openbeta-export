However, as such it sat completely ignored for the last 10 years.\n\nIn June 2019, it was retro-bolted by a party unaware that it had been climbed as there was little evidence left behind and the sparse/marginal gear options understandably didn't look like reasonable pro. I was contacted by the bolter after they realized their mistake, and am fine with the bolting and cleaning that it apparently received. It seems to me to be a better use of the resource given the growing popularity of the canyon, and the fact that a deadly moderate doesn't really appeal to most folks.
