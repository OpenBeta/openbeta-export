The crux is 2/3 the way through the first pitch. An airy roof traverse that seems scarier than it is. The rock is suprisingly awesome. This route is a true test of your mini roof climbing abilities.\n\nP1.Climb the dihedral through the pineapple colored rock to the first roof. Veer left around the roof and continue 15 up a beautiful vertical crack on the north face until you acquire a small ledge (the guidebook says \"placing good belay anchors here requires thought\" is a very astute notation).\n\nP2.

Follow your choice of multiple crack systems to the right of Pineapple Thunderpussy. The first pitch is low angle, easy fifth class, and can be a little bit dirty. Belay at a tree on a ledge approximately 60 feet up. Then work up and slightly right, through a short chimney, into the main crack systems. Enjoy the romp up the rest of the climb. This is a long pitch, and rope drag can get bad. Keep this in mind when placing gear. Exit to the right at a tree, before the very top of the buttress. The climbing becomes much more difficult if you don't. Belay at this tree.","protection":"The route follows good crack systems. A standard rack will suffice, if you are comfortable running it out on easy terrain. Adding extra pieces from BD .75 to 3, and a 4 would let you protect it quite nicely.
