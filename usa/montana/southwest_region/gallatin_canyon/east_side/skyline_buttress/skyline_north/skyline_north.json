Sitting high above the river, the route offers fun climbing at a modest grade with sweeping views from comfortable belays. All in all, it's an enjoyable day on good rock.\n\nThere are many  ways to break up the climb due to plentiful ledges, but basically parties follow the ridge crest, finding an interesting mix of climbing problems including chimneys, slim crests, face, and  cracks, with many variations that offer harder climbing. One might choose to run out the rope if the party is experienced, and, alternatively, short pitches can be done to maintain communication and ease rope handling.\n\nA single rope is adequate for completing the route.\n\nBegin climbing on the north side of the initial buttress by ascending a chimney. Continue to a ledge where a rap station allows descent to the south, to the base of another chimney. Climb this enjoyable and somewhat odd feature, involving a narrow squeeze through a hole at the top, or for bigger people or those carrying a pack, climbing out and right. .\n\nContinue up steps and reach a section of short towers which can be passed on the north. Beyond this section is a small notch, and from this point  finish left into a strange chimney/corridor, as one alternative.\n\nScramble  across some narrow rock and descend to the north where a faint trail leads to the notch behind the formation, or finish with a short step to the summit. Make an 80' rap to a big ledge. Join the trail back to the bottom.\n\nMany interesting variations can be done so be creative and enjoy a fine outing.","protection":"A small selection of stoppers, a few cams to 3\", and lots of runners should provide plenty of pro.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"8HvmKIZfXHySJvoRF6r9rg==","name":"Sky King","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Bill Dockins & Kim Keating (September 1981)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.22837,45.41887]},"left_right_index":11,"mp_id":"113215990","mp_crag_id":"112820164","climb_id":"8HvmKIZfXHySJvoRF6r9rg==","areaRef":"bGFbVbODVYaKyUJXNaaQ+A=="},"content":{"description":"A hard start leads to some cool movement up a thin crack.
