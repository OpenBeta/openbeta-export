It is a perfect way to link the classic lower climbs of the Watchtower and Pineapple Buttresses with popular climbs in the Sparerib area. Best to not leave equipment at the base of Silver Foxes as the direct walk back is difficult.\n\nPitch 1\n\n:\n\n(5.7, 120')\n\nClimb 20' through a small overlap, then follow bolts up surprisingly good rock to the anchor. Fun pitch! 11 bolts,  a BD 0.2 helps, chain anchor.\n\nPitch 2: (\n\n5.8, 90')\n\nContinue face climbing; avoid a loose, ledgy area by following the bolt line to the right up to the anchor. 8 bolts, one BD #2 or 3 cam, chain anchor.\n\nOptional P2 belay:\n\nClimb 25' past P2 chains, and belay on the massive ledge right below the crux bulge to watch the excitement at the crux bulge. BD #1 and 4 cams for the belay.\n\nPitch 3\n\n:\n\n(5.10a/b, 110')\n\nThe money pitch! Delightful face climbing with one somewhat tricky and airy 5.10 bulge move. 7 bolts and a few BD cams 0.1-0.5\". GEAR ANCHOR, BD #2-3 cams, and small stoppers, or just sling one of several bomber boulders/horns.\n\nPitch 3 alternative\n\n:\n\n(5.6, 110')\n\nFun, easy trad climb to the left of pitch 3.
