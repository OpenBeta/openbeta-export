Your first 'piece' is a bolt just off the ground and then you have two more bolts right around the first crux, the rest is small nuts and maybe small cams. Climb over some decent finger jams and crimps over the first bulge, at the seam traverse a few feet right and follow the seam up to the very obvious rectangular hole in the wall. Continue over relatively good holds and gear to a final hard move right at the top. An absolute must do for anyone who places gear at this level, it is a pretty line with good gear and great movement.","protection":"Pretty much all small nuts, might be able to put in a cam or two and there are three bolts in the wall.
