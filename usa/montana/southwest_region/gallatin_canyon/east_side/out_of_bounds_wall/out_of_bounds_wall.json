It is a great route, and if you are already up in the Sparerib/Skyline area, it is worth the extra little hike up there. North facing and cool temps mid summer! Great rock quality. Awesome belay ledges.\n\nPitch 1 (5.8, 100')\n\nFrom the top of the pedestal, build a little anchor using very small gear. Route starts just left around the corner. The step-off left is exposed and not a gimme. Move up the weakness/cracks past a small tree towards a good sized ledge with a good sized tree on it. Gear belay.\n\nPitch 2 (5.8, 60')\n\nFrom the belay, ascend the ramp to the left and into the next crack system. Pull through the small roof, and finish in a cool lieback near the top. Belay either at the huge tree, or (recommended) step right and use the cracks on the prow.\n\nDescent:\n\nThis is a somewhat exposed, but easy and protectable scramble. We stayed roped up. From the top of the 2nd pitch, step right across an exposed gap, and then follow the prow around to an awkward, but easy down climb on a flake with a 4\" crack in it. Once you gain the easy, safe ground, it is easy walking back down and left around back to the packs.","protection":"Standard rack with micro cams and stoppers very helpful. BD#4 helps on the descent.","location":"Lookers right side of Out of Bounds wall. Hike up to the top of Sparerib via the trail on the south side, and once you are up and around the tip of base of The Wafer and on the north side, follow the base of the Wafer wall until you are forced downhill to your left. You will approach the wall from the back/side. Wall faces north, so wont be super obvious you are there. Route starts on a little pedestal with a flat evergreen bush growing on it (see photo)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6d93ce9a-b1f9-55de-ba48-51d186dd1ef8,8f38b276-2760-5622-b0c2-03625573cc64,23156b26-b567-50e6-8d95-a771171fd408,6e521460-906b-5b30-a4be-5357410788e1,88fb303b-596f-5385-af9f-f2c499fa43f3","pathTokens":["USA","Montana","Southwest Region","Gallatin Canyon","East Side","Out of Bounds Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.22833,45.42038]},"bbox":[-111.22897063306307,45.41993033981814,-111.22768936693694,45.42082966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112802590","area_id":"iPswO1lvU4Wvn/LEmfpD8w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:34.727Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:30.211Z"}
