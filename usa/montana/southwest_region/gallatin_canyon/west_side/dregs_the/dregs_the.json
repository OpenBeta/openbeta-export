The second route established on this tier in 2008, the crack took several hours to de-vegetate. The hardest pure trad route in the canyon.(?)\n\nStart just right and 30' below overhanging/left-leaning crack. The business starts at this crack. Lie-back this overhang via increasing difficult grips and feet with small gear. At the apex of overhang a fixed nut marks the crux. Powerful lie-backing to blind jams with smears for feet. Easier crack leads to anchors.\n\nHopefully no more routes will be squeezed next to this great line.
