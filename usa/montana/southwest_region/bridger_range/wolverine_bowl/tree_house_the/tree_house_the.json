To get there go uphill past the bud wall about 20 feet and traverse across to the low point of the saddle to the right(north). Basically just hike up and over the saddle. The tree house is located on a large triangular face with trees around the base.\n\nIf you find bolts on the rock, you are there. As of summer 2014 the Tree house is the only wall north of the Bud Wall/over the saddle.
