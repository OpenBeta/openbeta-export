The route is fairly sustained but only requires a single bolt protected move of 5.10 on pitch three.\n\nBegin the route by scrambling up ledges below the obvious right facing dihedral.\n\nPitch One: Climb up through a steep right facing corner with fun climbing until the angle backs off. Continue up the corner system until a small ledge with a two bolt anchor is encountered on the right (100').\n\nPitch Two: Continue up the corner passing small roofs until it becomes possible to step left to a bolted belay on arete (115').\n\nPitch Three: Climb past large roof system on left and continue up until a traverse back right into the main corner becomes possible. Near the top of the corner a roof is encountered, pass this by traversing right past a bolt (crux) and continuing to a bolted anchor in a notch on the ridge 100').\n\nDescend the route. A single 70 meter rope works perfect. Or continue up the ridge for many more pitches. This recommended option increases the difficulty and certainly increases the adventure.","protection":"Gear to #2 Camalot.","location":"Look for the most obvious dihedral on the west face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6d93ce9a-b1f9-55de-ba48-51d186dd1ef8,cc545a19-da0f-5476-b816-f6457f3fbdb1,4e9ae361-2064-5b4c-9071-eddf863d68ae,f537c8a0-3a14-5cd6-a393-8b12c74b45cf,5f4d89aa-c133-5052-bb8d-cd0a714685c7","pathTokens":["USA","Montana","Northwest Region","Blodgett Canyon","Cornler Ridge","Cornlier Ridge"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.2619,46.2745]},"bbox":[-114.26255054616745,46.274050339818146,-114.26124945383256,46.274949660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107709644","area_id":"X02JqsEzUFK7jc0KcUaFxw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.26255054616745,46.274050339818146],[-114.26124945383256,46.274050339818146],[-114.26124945383256,46.274949660181875],[-114.26255054616745,46.274949660181875],[-114.26255054616745,46.274050339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:31.866Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:27.532Z"}
