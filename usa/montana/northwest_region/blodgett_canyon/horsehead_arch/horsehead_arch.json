Jam up the steep splitter in the inside of the arch and then slab up the cracks to the base of the arch. The blocks are a bit worrisome but seem pretty solid.\n\nPitch 2:\n\n~5.6, 50'. Make an airy bouldery move around left onto the top of the arch, then crawl along to the base of the summit block. There are a few places for medium-sized cams.\n\nTop:\n\nThere is a pretty good flake just below the summit block to set a belay anchor.\n\nDescent:\n\nFor this climb, the descent is just as fun as the ascent. Do a counterbalance rappel with your partner from just below the south side of the final summit block. Double ropes needed (double 50's would reach).\n\nDisclaimer: The internet has very little information on Horsehead Arch other than a few vague accounts of it being climbed in some way and at some doable grade. I cannot find any route descriptions for the arch published in any guidebooks. Since climbers like route names and ratings, I have taken the liberty of creating route names and assigning approximate grades to the routes my partner and I did up either side of the arch.
