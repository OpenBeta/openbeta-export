(NOTE: From here there are many possible variations on how to finish P7 & P8.

There are many rappel routes from here, all utilizing trees. Make 3-4 raps to a very large flat area. (If you want to put new webbing on all the raps, you'll probably want 25+ feet). Continue by walking/scrambling down some scree and small ledges (you'll want real shoes), until you reenter the scree field with the cairn used on the approach.\n\nAlternate descent: It is possible to rap down the middle of the face using anchors from the Pierce Route/Space Cat/Afterbuner.

This line combines pitches from a few different named routes(/pitches?) to take what's nearly a plumb line up the middle of the proudest face in the canyon, Flathead Buttress. When I did it we freed every pitch except for the 25' crux section of Space Cat. Doing it this way is very fun, still challenging, and clocks in at about 5.11 C1.\n\nI climbed this a while back so the details here might not be perfect but the main points are definitely all there. I did not think routefinding was an issue at all.\n\nIf anyone has more information on the FA/FFA of the route/individual pitches or if this thing has a real name, I'd love to hear it. Here's what I've been able to figure out, Ballard-Everingham did the FA of the first 2 pitches during the FA of the South Face Route (1971) and Lowe-Ballard did the FFA of these two pitches (1979, I think this was when it was renamed My Mom's Muscle Shirt). The 1988 AAJ gives the details on the FA of the Pierce route, named after Richard Pierce of Missoula who died on Pumori in December 1984 at age 26, which was completed by Carville-Wallace in 1987 at 10 pitches, 5.11-. In the writeup they reference Afterburner so this pitch was likely done before 1987, and I have no idea on the details of the Space Cat pitch, but would assume it was established more recently.\n\nRoute:\n\nP1 and P2: Start on the first 2 pitches of the classic My Mom's Muscle Shirt (aka South Face Route), belaying on the spacious Homestake Ledge at the 2 closely spaced bolts with old homemade hangers found at the top of pitch 2. 5.10a\n\nP3: The Afterburner pitch. Climb the excellent right-facing Afterburner corner directly above the belay. A #4 is strongly advised; a #5 could be placed but is not mandatory. Ends at a bolted anchor on an excellent ledge. 5.10\n\nP4: Space Cat. I think this has been freed at 5.13. The meat of this pitch is about 8 bolts in a row over techy face climbing. The bolts are good except for the last one which is sticking half way out. A few more cruxy moves on thin gear and then it eases back to 5.10 to finish the pitch. Even topstepping (in a sling) on some of the bolts I found it mandatory to be able to do 5.11 moves to go bolt to bolt, unless you use a cheat stick.  The top of this pitch eases up and finishes at a bolted anchor on a small, sloping foot ledge. From here I believe it would be trivial to do a short traverse left and around a corner to the top of the offwidth pitch on My Mom's Muscle shirt (but I haven't done this). Need small gear for beginning and end of this pitch. 5.11 C1\n\nP5. Join the upper part of the Pierce Memorial Route (the lower part of this route takes a right facing corner system just to the east of Afterburner/Space Cat, I know of no information about it but it looks good and it would probably be free climbable at a reasonable grade).The crux of this pitch comes early, difficult jamming on a quintessential Blodgett style slightly flaring finger crack. Getting situated in the crack is also hard and the protection at the start of the pitch is so-so, definitely not great, spicy! When you reach a black dike after about 100', the climbing eases a bit, traverse right to a bolted anchor. 5.11\n\nP6. Continue up the Pierce Route. Start the pitch with a traverse right (higher is easier than lower) to an obvious left facing corner. Excellent crack climbing leads you up the corner. High on this pitch the crack pinches down and goes through a left leaning overhang. The pro here looked very thin so I opted to step right onto the arÃªte and bypass the roof via some delicate face climbing, rejoining the corner higher up. The pitch is capped off by a devious slab move through some kitty litteresque rock to reach the bolted belay. 5.11.\n\nP7. One last, easier pitch that goes basically straight up takes you to the top of the formation! 5.9\n\nDescent: On the top find the rap anchor slightly below and to the east. Rappel the route with 2 ropes (80m might work?), utilizing all the belays from the route. I believe some of the rappels can be linked with 2 ropes, but we didn't do this except for from Homestake Ledge to the base.","protection":"Gear: Double rack with maybe a few extra finger and finger+ sized pieces, RPs, and some bigger gear for P3.

Start as for Muscle Shirt, follow this for the first two pitches and its P3 traverse left, and the excellent P4 finger crack. Muscle Shirt goes up from here. Instead, keep going left (P5, 5.6) to a belay under a shallow corner ascending a steep, blank face. Pitch 6 goes up this to a bolt ladder (interspersed with hard-to-see bathook holes) going up and right to a pendy into a left-facing corner system. Go up this a ways to a belay. Pitches 7, 8 and 9 lead first to a big ledge system with blocks and trees and then a blocky ramp (A1, 5.9) above. Angle up and right up the ramp to a left-facing A2 dihedral, up this to a 5.7 traverse back left to the Bomb Shelter bivy. Above this is another left-facing dihedral system, A2 or so, which gains another ledge.
