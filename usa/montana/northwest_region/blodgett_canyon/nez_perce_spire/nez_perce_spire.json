The route does have it's share of loose rock but it should not deter you. It's pitches range from fingers, hands, to the crux squeeze chimney on pitch 7. This route is not only aesthetically pleasing but also has some spectacular climbing. Go do it!","protection":"Bring a standard double rack of cams to 3\", stoppers, you may want to bring a 00 or two for the scary first pitch.\n\nThe route has a good amount of fixed gear. A few belays are supplemented with old buttonheads and LAs. These belays probably should be spruced up, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring along a drilling kit.\n\nBring two 60s","location":"Follow the upper ramp, past some junipers and a pine tree, all the way to the end of the ramp where you will find a sandy ledge. The route begins here.\n\nPitch 1. 5.9R Begin climbing straight up past a small tree, trend right on face and thin cracks into a left facing dihedral to an obvious belay.\n\nPitch 2. 5.8 Climb straight up through cracks and face climbing. To another obvious belay.\n\nPitch 3. 5.7PG13 The route does not head up steep \"column\" cracks. Traverse out left of the belay, rounding the arÃªte, to the west face. From here, climb cracks, large hollow sounding flakes and face to a large ledge with a tree for the belay. Rope drag can be very bad on this pitch so extend placements.\n\nPitch 4. 5.10a This is a long one. Start up easy crack and face climbing. Climbing becomes harder as you go higher. Make a semi hanging belay off a suspended block, and an old button head this belay may need a new bolt in the future.\n\nPitch 5. 5.10c Crux pitch. Climb thin cracks to the L shaped roof. Crank through the roof, and make sure you get a good piece in before entering the runout 30ft squeeze chimney (super exposed!). If the follower is carrying a pack, have them tag it behind them. Once you emerge from the chimney climb up and left to two left facing dihedrals. Do not climb the first of the two, traverse to the second dihedral and climb to a belay stance.\n\nPitch 6. 5.9+ Pull through roof (watch for loose rock) and climb up toward a wonderful right facing dihedral. Stem and jam up to good face holds, and up to a belay ledge.\n\nPitch 7. 4th/5th class climbing to summit.\n\nDecent: once at the summit walk 50 yards northeast until you reach the start of the large slab/bowl. You can either walk down or rap. There is webbing on a few trees to make a double rope rap to the bottom of the slab. From the bottom of the slab wind your way down talus and slab to the eastern slabs of Nez Perce. In the dark it is extremely difficult to get down the way you came up. If you descend to far left of the initial talus field you will end up crossing the creek into lodge pole dead fall and the same thing will happen if you trend to far right. So try and descend directly under Blackfoot dome. Best of luck on this descent."},"__v":0},{"_id":"F37cjZFVXn6f523kDZnjhw==","name":"A Modern Home Environment","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Keith Schultz, Bruce Anderson","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.2768,46.27736]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"108395318","mp_crag_id":"108372213","climb_id":"F37cjZFVXn6f523kDZnjhw==","areaRef":"0DVCASQfXvKZ+G5kDZur6A=="},"content":{"description":"A great route in an awesome location.  Some great free climbing broken by sections of quality aid.  The Falcon Guide for Montana is fraught with contradictions about the route and pitch breakdowns, if you choose to use it be forewarned...\n\nBegin on the same approach ledge as for the SW Buttress.\n\nP1: Begin in blocky, right facing corner by a juniper bush.  Climb up the broken corner to a small ledge to the right of a live tree with bail slings on it.  Belay near the tree. (5.9+ PG13)\n\nP2: Climb above tree into obvious left trending weakness (5.6) until you reach a solution pocket (#2 Camalot useful) where you can make a slabby traverse right to a left facing corner with a small tree on top.  Climb around tree to the right side of the tower and up to a nice ledge with a 2 bolt anchor.  This long pitch wanders a bit and double ropes can really reduce the rope drag.  It could also easily be broken down into two shorter pitches. (5.10)\n\nP3: Aid past several bolts above the belay (A hook move or easy free move might be necessary) and into a long splitter crack to large ledge.  This pitch has probably gone free but Im not sure by whom. (If you've done it speak up!) (C2/5.12+?)\n\nP4: Layback flake/crack on right side of ledge (5.9) and traverse left past a small, discontinuous right facing corner and into larger, more continuous left facing corner.  Aid up corner past a few bolts at the top to a nice belay ledge with two bolts.  (5.9/A2)\n\nP5: Aid Shallow right facing corner off belay into thin seam.  Follow seam past some fixed copperheads into a long continuos kinfeblade seam.  Continue up seam until you reach a hanging belay below a roof.  A few fixed pins, a fixed beak and some marginal cam placements are available for the belay. (A3)\n\nP6: Aid out right under roof (thin, A3), and continue until you reach a point where it is possible to climb through the roof on solid cam and nut placements (a few fixed nuts here).  Belay above roof in a small alcove on good gear.  Short pitch. (A3)\n\nP7: Free climb up blocky right-trending weakness to the right of the belay.  Watch for loose rock.  Use your best judgement (more than one option) to find your way through the blockyness and up to a spot where the angle eases near the top of the buttress.  5.9\n\nScramble to top, Hooray!\n\nPlease feel free to improve upon this description.","protection":"A set of nuts, a double set of cams from small TCUs to #3 Camalot, 7 or so KBs, a few copperheads (in case some are blown), a hook or two, and a small cam hook may allow to skip a few pin placements.","location":"Begins on small 3rd class ledge a hundred feet or so to the right of the start for the SW Buttress near a small juniper.\n\nThe line follows a continuous, at times thin, weakness straight up the center of the South face.
