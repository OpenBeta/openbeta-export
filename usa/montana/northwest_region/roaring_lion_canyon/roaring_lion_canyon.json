Pitch 1. 5.4 Start at cairn on east side the buttress. Go up and left toward a tree then continue up to less steep terrain to build a belay. Pitch 2. 5.9 Slightly runout. Go up through dihedral, watch for the giant loose block. Continue past large tree and up to ledge where the route begins to get steep, bolted belay. Pitch 3. 5.11a Great exposed pitch! Clip a bolt and climb the tips finger crack (small wires). Continue to bolted belay. Pitch 5. 5.10a Fun last pitch. Follow bolt line through edges and pinches. There are lots of good stopper placements between runouts. Top out and you'll see anchors dead ahead. 2 bolted raps. Double rope rap off west side of buttress.","protection":"Single rack to 2'', set of stoppers, and a some QDs will do the trick.","location":"Not much of an approach trail. Take the main trail until you spot an obvious steep face on the north side of canyon. Cross the creek and up through talus to east side of the buttress.
