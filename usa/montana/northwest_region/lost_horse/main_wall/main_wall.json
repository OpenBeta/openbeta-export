Continue up into a splitter finger crack that widens to a fist crack. Belay in alcove. No fixed anchor.\n\nP2: (5.10a) Climb hand crack to a tree belay on the big ledge known as Mountaineers Ledge. 180 feet to the ground from here.\n\nP3: (5.8) Go up corner to the right, step right around a roof and climb a corner to a ledge, use a gear belay.\n\nP4: This is more of a traverse left to the rappel bolts.
