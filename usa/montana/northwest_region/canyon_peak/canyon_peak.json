Follow the trail to the lower lake(6 miles), from here make your way up to the upper lake on a faint user trail (north of the lake). Look for the couloir that splits the SE ridge, use this feature to scramble up to the ridge crest. Scramble toward the peak along the low angle ridge, about halfway to the summit a notch is encountered and the angle of the rock increases. If you choose to rope up this is a good spot. Follow the ridge crest to the top of the peak. To descend rap off to the south and scramble back down the couloir or down-climb the north face route until a series of rappel stations are reached.","protection":"light alpine rack, possibly an ice axe for early season","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6d93ce9a-b1f9-55de-ba48-51d186dd1ef8,cc545a19-da0f-5476-b816-f6457f3fbdb1,28d56fde-0bcb-551f-b520-4da49390de71","pathTokens":["USA","Montana","Northwest Region","Canyon Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.3538,46.2447]},"bbox":[-114.35445019269537,46.244250339818144,-114.35314980730465,46.24514966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108179877","area_id":"KNVv3gvLVR+1IE2kk5DecQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.35445019269537,46.244250339818144],[-114.35314980730465,46.244250339818144],[-114.35314980730465,46.24514966018187],[-114.35445019269537,46.24514966018187],[-114.35445019269537,46.244250339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:39.909Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:58.016Z"}
