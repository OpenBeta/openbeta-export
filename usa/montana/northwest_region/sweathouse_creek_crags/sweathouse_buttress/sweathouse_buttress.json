Fun climbing, a little adventurous and a beautiful setting. The climb can be done fairly quickly as it is only 3 pitches so it is a nice option to crag the the Lower Crags afterward.\n\nP1. 5.10a/b start up obvious left facing dihedral system directly above a very large boulder. You will know your on the right route if you pass an oddly placed bolt near a crack. Build your own belay at a large ledge.\n\nP2. 5.8 Blocky 5th class and move right into a left leaning flaring flake system and then into 5.8 finger crack to large. Belay at a sloping ledge with two bolt anchor.\n\nP3. 5.10c Great stemming and finger crack on good rock. Climb through stemming corner and past a roof to a tree with webbing for rapping.\n\nRap with double 60 meter ropes to bolted belay with rap rings. One more double rope rap will get you to the ground.","protection":"Doubles 1/8\" to 3\"","location":"Starts in left facing dihedral just above a very large boulder.
