Although it is a long single pitch (55m), I set it up with a mid-station rap point. This allows the choice of two raps from the top (with a single rope) and it allows a two pitch climb with a nice bolted station at a small ledge. As there are very few two-pitch climbs at Stone Hills, it's nice to use as \"practice\" for multi-pitch climbing.\n\nAlthough one of the guidebooks attributes the first ascent to another climber, don't believe it. The nature of the cliff surrounding Flame has huge variety in route selection. One or two other climbers may have halfheartedly attempted death-defying trad routes in and around that area...\n\nBut Flame was prepped solely by myself, with a great amount of scrubbing, cleaning and drilling, in 1996... and I can say with great confidence, no one climbed it before me.\n\nI chose the route very carefully and I believe it is the best climb on that whole section NW of the bridge (maybe one of the best climbs in the whole Stone Hills area). As I haven't climbed there since 1997, I really hope there has been more route development in the last 10 years?\n\nGoing from memory... I think the crux (very thin face) was on the first pitch? The second pitch is steep and sustained, with great exposure and a great view. The whole route is basically thin face climbing - with a few small finger cracks and pockets for variety.","protection":"Flame is mostly a sport route. Can't remember the number of bolts, but I think I left a few gear placements to play with on the first pitch?\n\nCheck the recent guide book to determine if a small rack is needed. If so, it will be nuts/cams under 1\" (????)\n\nThere is a two bolt station with chains, half-way up (or down).\n\nIt can be climbed as a long single pitch, but needs at least a 55-60m rope.\n\nTwo bolts at top edge, with a third, set back for belaying.","location":"Looking from the highway on the east side of the lake, Flame is an obvious light colored narrow band with dark lichen on either side, on the biggest cliff face visible. You'll really need a recent guide book to help you with specific directions...\n\nGood luck, it's really worth it leave the crowds at HUB and head over there sometime."},"__v":0},{"_id":"KgZHJ6aWVgK1OE81vVJ08Q==","name":"Ben Parson's Memorial Route","yds":"5.10b/c","grades":{"yds":"5.10b/c","french":"6b"},"fa":"AY, BE","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.30044,48.79092]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"116715329","mp_crag_id":"106159850","climb_id":"KgZHJ6aWVgK1OE81vVJ08Q==","areaRef":"075ojX5uXA6tfnqEfz7lFg=="},"content":{"description":"A really great route dedicated to a really great friend, husband, father, son, brother, firefighter, paramedic, skier, and cyclist ... who didn't really climb much.\n\nThe longest all-trad line at Stone Hill?\n\nFirst pitch is 5.10b/c, second is 5.9, great gear all the way.","protection":"Single rack with gear to 4, chains mid-wall and on top, a 60m rope will get it done with two raps.","location":"Past Upper Lakeside Wall, past Lower Lakeside Wall, keep going, go past a few new long sport routes not in the guide book, go around a corner and you'll see an obvious belay platform and an obvious scrubbed crack/face line up the gut with chains mid-wall.
