There is some loose rock en route, but I generally found placements I liked, including a couple fall-all-day ones.\n\nBecause this line is next to a good 5.7 sport route, I am not under the illusion that I made the FA, or even the first trad FA, so I welcome any information pertaining to that and to the route's name if it has one.\n\nWhen I led this, I was by myself and had to use my Soloist and a ground anchor, and I also had to rappel the route in order to clean it, and I found that the best anchor was tying off two trees that were a little skinnier than I'd have liked but which had to do. Those first skinny trees I had any faith in were also well back from the top, maybe a good 50', so plan accordingly if you want to set a toprope.\n\nAlternatively, you could probably belay a second from the Two Pines anchors and set a directional at the top of this route without too much trouble.\n\nThe 5.8 is my estimate based on my feeling that pulling the small roof down low was a bit harder than anything on Two Pines. Other than that, I'd call the rest 5.6 or 5.7. You can bypass the roof on the right, but I didn't see any good pro there. I did go that way on TR and found it easier, but again, on lead it likely will be a run-out start.","protection":"I used cams, nuts, hexes, and Tricams up to a cam in between a C4 3 and 4.\n\nSee above for information about anchors.","location":"After passing the second, smaller waterfall, cross the stream and hike a little more to a cliff on the right.
