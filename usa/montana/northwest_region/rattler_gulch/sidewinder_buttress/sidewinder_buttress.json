You will reach a horizontal crack that takes some good gear and then pull up onto a thin face for some committing and bold moves. Run it out or find some gear over easier ground to the anchors. This could be a great climb if it was cleaned up, rebolted, and shown a little love. Not sure if the FA party just did a terrible job, or if the route was partially chopped, or maybe a huge piece of the wall fell off containing the rest of the route.
