It is possible to pull around the arete to the right and power layback to jugs, but falling would whipsaw your lead line down said arete.\n\nAnd above this, three bolts through some 5.10 crimping guards the chains.\n\nBring small-medium nuts and potentially doubles in microcams (00-1 C3, or 0-2 UL mastercams) up to a #2 or 3 Camalot plus a few sport draws for the top.\n\nAs of early September 2019, this route hasn't seen a lead or clean TR ascent. Comment below if you get it done and we'll update the grade and gear beta. Since it shares anchors with Nothin' But Mammals, it's pretty simple to lead NBM and then TR Shark Week (you'll want a cordalette or slings to extend the anchor over the sharp edge beneath it).
