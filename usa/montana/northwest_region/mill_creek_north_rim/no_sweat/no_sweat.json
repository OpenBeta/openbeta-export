No hanging Belays just good fun.  You can set up a belay pretty much anywhere you would like.","protection":"Single Rack","location":"roughly 45 minute approach. main trail, cross bridge, take left, 10 minutes later you will go right on the approach trail. Keep going until you see the gully, go half way up and there will be a great ledge with a fixed .5 C4  Great placements all the way through.  I used my C4 #1s the most. Easy climb with solid belay stations. While it is possible to rap off in the gully I do not recommend that. .  Rapping down route would be a convenient way to go if you do not mind leaving some webbing. Great rock quality some loose rock, helmets a must. There is a variation to the top of the spire that runs at 10c.  There are many variations to this and some are very hard to protect due to the poor rock quality.  There is an easy 5.5 on the very back with a fixed stake for rapping off.\n\nGREAT SCENERY!!!\n\nbring water"},"__v":0},{"_id":"aIjlcEV4VeiW877JtQGsJA==","name":"Dihedrals East","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.2496,46.31045]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"108565331","mp_crag_id":"107756982","climb_id":"aIjlcEV4VeiW877JtQGsJA==","areaRef":"M6fxaNIDWeeldBDgbGG4lQ=="},"content":{"description":"","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6d93ce9a-b1f9-55de-ba48-51d186dd1ef8,cc545a19-da0f-5476-b816-f6457f3fbdb1,b5e12f92-14cc-52f5-9906-b0cbb17e13b8,33a7f168-d203-59e7-a574-10e06c61b895","pathTokens":["USA","Montana","Northwest Region","Mill Creek North Rim","No Sweat"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.2496,46.31045]},"bbox":[-114.25025097333396,46.31000033981814,-114.24894902666604,46.31089966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107756982","area_id":"M6fxaNIDWeeldBDgbGG4lQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:38.491Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:35.516Z"}
