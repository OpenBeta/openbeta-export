Each pitch is interesting and varied. Pitch 1: 10c, 20 m. Pitch 2: 10d, 20 m. Pitch 3, 11a/b, 30 m. Pitch 4, 5.9, 18 m. The third pitch ends on a ledge that if you walk east will lead to the Tick Farm, etc. If you rappel the route make sure to knot the ends of the rope. A doubled 60 m rope is just barely long enough!","protection":"Bolts","location":"After First Girlfriend Buttress do not climb up to the Tick Farm/Amphitheater but continue strait around the base of the main cliff for about 10-15 minutes.
