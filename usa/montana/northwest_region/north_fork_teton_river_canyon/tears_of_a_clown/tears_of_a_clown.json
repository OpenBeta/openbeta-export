Balance on flakes to gain the slab then follow run out cold shuts to a set of anchors. There are anchors at the end of the 5.9 section, but it is better to  run past them to the next set 90ft up. Next pitch traverse under the roof for 100' to a single cold shut below two roofs. Belay from this easy ground for the next pitch. that goes through both roofs (or around if you want to keep it at 5.7). The second roof is very stout for a 5.7. It goes at 5.9+ with a pretty heady move pulling the roof with a sloping mantle move above the bolt. The route is pretty consistent slab climbing after the roof for another two pitches. The climbing is pretty easy but the 15'-20' between bolts will keep your excitement high. The views are incredible and the belays spots are pretty good.\n\nWalk off the route up and right at last anchor. Follow a gulley down to the base. If rappelling you will need two 60m ropes.","protection":"Up to 12 quickdraws if you are going to combine pitches.\n\nBelay anchors are cold shut eye bolts.\n\nBolts between anchors are sportingly spaced.\n\nDon't cam the flake on the first 5.9 alternate start.
