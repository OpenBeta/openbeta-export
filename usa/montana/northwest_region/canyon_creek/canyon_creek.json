Shortly after passing the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness sign you'll notice formations up to your right. The formation that Lunacy Cracks is on, is more or less, the first major buttress you'll see. It looks like a mini version Shoshone Spire in Blodgett with a slab apron that skirts it's base with fairly large trees on top of the apron. Start contouring up and to it's left (west) side. Once on the the west side you should see a junky looking chimney (do not climb). From here traverse above the slab apron to a very big treed area/ledge (seen from the trail) where the actual wall starts getting steep. The route starts on/near an arete. You are in the right spot if, to the right, you see some steep single pitch cracks. P1 climbs a single crack system that starts on the arete and trends left into the face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6d93ce9a-b1f9-55de-ba48-51d186dd1ef8,cc545a19-da0f-5476-b816-f6457f3fbdb1,bf87d159-e00f-53f6-b959-efde20a01b84","pathTokens":["USA","Montana","Northwest Region","Canyon Creek"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.27125,46.25298]},"bbox":[-114.2719002908522,46.252530339818136,-114.27059970914776,46.25342966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114386811","area_id":"v4fRWeAPU/a5We/eIKAbhA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.2719002908522,46.252530339818136],[-114.27059970914776,46.252530339818136],[-114.27059970914776,46.25342966018187],[-114.2719002908522,46.25342966018187],[-114.2719002908522,46.252530339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:31.235Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:26.507Z"}
