If you can climb the grade, this is a must do! And if you cannot, use the bolts and A0 your way across the crux pitch (pendulums anyone?) or use the\n\nSawed Off Heads Variation\n\nto access the upper pitches. All anchors have bolts, except for the top. If you climb the short last pitch, plan to walk all the way off and back around the base of the\n\nNorth Rim\n\n. Start early and top this one out!\n\nPitch 1\n\n- (5.8 DFU) Starting at the toe of the Great Awakening Wall, climb up and just right on very easy ground. The rock is not of terrible nature, but offers very little worthwhile gear for a ways. No bolts. Make your way into a small weakness system, find gear, and cruise to the grassy ledge.\n\nPitch 2\n\n- (5.10) Climb up and right over a blocky ramp, continue straight up into a shallow right facing, arching corner. Fire the thin finger crack on small gear around the bulge to the anchors\n\nPitch 3\n\n- (5.10) Mill Creek splitter. Giggle your way up the hand crack to the ledge.\n\nPitch 4\n\n- (5.10) Step left on the ledge to gain the weakness. Climb up and back right to the anchors.\n\nPitch 5\n\n- (5.10) Venture up and right from the anchor, gaining the bolts. Traverse right on small edges into the Sawed Off Heads dihedral, continue up dihedral to anchor.\n\nPitch 6\n\n- (5.9) Bust up and right off the anchor and follow the ramp out of sight. Take the easy ledge system far right until you are below a huge flake that waves off the wall. Climb straight up to the anchor.\n\nPitch 7\n\n- (5.10) Gain the mondo flake, head left off the top and follow the bolts. When the bolts run out, don't climb left, go straight up, finding just enough pods for gear until the climbing backs off. Continue up to a large ledge. Spicy, this is pure 5.10 brilliance.\n\nPitch 8\n\n- (5.10) Climb the large, open weakness system to the left, do not go up the right corner.\n\nPitch 9\n\n- (5.10) Triple Cracks pitch. Follow the three cracks all the way. So good!\n\nPitch 10\n\n- (5.9) Little shorty to the top. Climb the corner over to the right.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6d93ce9a-b1f9-55de-ba48-51d186dd1ef8,cc545a19-da0f-5476-b816-f6457f3fbdb1,4811a1c5-02b2-5098-bebb-19966b66c5b7,8c176459-0dbb-50f6-ae70-ed9240e2c181","pathTokens":["USA","Montana","Northwest Region","Mill Creek","Great Awakening Wall, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.25046,46.31112]},"bbox":[-114.2511109813028,46.310670339818145,-114.24980901869719,46.311569660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111621064","area_id":"jBdkWQ27UPaucO2SQOLBgQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.2511109813028,46.310670339818145],[-114.24980901869719,46.310670339818145],[-114.24980901869719,46.311569660181874],[-114.2511109813028,46.311569660181874],[-114.2511109813028,46.310670339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:39.907Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:57.695Z"}
