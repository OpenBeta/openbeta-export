Offering a variety of climbing styles, this route packs a punch. Zig-zag your way up the clean face for two pitches, gaining the obvious right facing corner above.

Route can be rapped, look for hidden anchors on top.\n\nPitch 1-(5.9) Follow the bolts up through the grey stone and right across the black streaks and overlaps.\n\nPitch 2-(5.10R) Climb up and left, aiming at the base of the hanging dihedral above. Only two bolts, DFU! Bring pins perhaps...\n\nPitch 3-(5.10) Send the corner.
