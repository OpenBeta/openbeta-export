It features relatively lower quality sandstone cliffs and boulders with splitter cracks. Although fragile face features will most likely break off, the cracks themselves are strong and can be protected with gear. Most of the 20-30ft blocks can also be top roped by use of earth anchors or climbed as highball boulders. Always inspect suspect flakes and chockstones prior to climbing, as large features have been known to fall off."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:16:29.298Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:44.308Z"}
