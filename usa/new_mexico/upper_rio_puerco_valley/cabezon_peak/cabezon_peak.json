Belay at the ledge above it. You will fully run out a 60 meter rope getting to the belay spot.\n\n Pitch 2, Go upward to a cliff face, then the left over blocky boulders and ledges to one of a few spots where you can more easily ascend between the gaps in the cliff face (crux 5.6 to 5.7), then left to a ledge on the skyline buttress. There is room here for three or four people.  To avoid severe rope drag, break this lead into two separate leads.\n\n Pitch 3, This is the fun pitch. In front of you is a textured rock zone that turns into a very wide (8'or so) very shallow chimney. Climb the textured back of the chimney exiting right about halfway up and continue upward among the giant mushroom shaped rock extrusions (chicken heads on steroids). Set belay in an alcove ledge. Only tricams work here in odd shaped pockets.  The alternative is to stay on the textured rock to the top.  I'ts easier and better protected and avoids the last pitch, but it's much less fun.\n\n Pitch 4, Continue up leftward on an easy partial pitch to the top.\n\n Descend on third class route on opposite side of the volcanic neck, being careful not to get off route. At one spot part way down it is difficult to tell whether to go left or right. Go right.","protection":"Standard rack to #3 Camelot and #1 to #3 tricams.","location":"Follow the standard route trail until you get to the barbed wire fence.
