This route is composed of two different boulder problems with a lie down and go to sleep rest in between (you can rest as long as you please). The first 3 bolts down low take you through a sequency initial crux, then walk past the cactus, and continue over the overhanging rock through the second crux (hidden hold). Watch your ass on the cactus (i.e. DON'T FALL HERE!) and clip two final bolts to the chains of glory.","protection":"5 bolts to anchors.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"jUkvHMhfVzuBrhN0vAIzLg==","name":"Cactus Practice","yds":"5.11b","grades":{"yds":"5.11b","french":"6c"},"fa":"Vaino Kodas 2005","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.99008,33.98603]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"107323153","mp_crag_id":"105791925","climb_id":"jUkvHMhfVzuBrhN0vAIzLg==","areaRef":"F8MEA2QlV2S/4k98rODujQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start off in the middle of major wall above a large prickly pear cactus.
