There are several crux sections although the hardest is at the top.  The rap from the top of the pitch (bolted anchor and chains) is about 105 feet although it can be done with a 60m rope. \n\n  There is an optional second pitch to the top.  It is gear protected at 5.8 to another bolted anchor.","protection":"A couple pieces of gear and then all bolts.","location":"Same start as Left Wing."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,990a83a0-3905-5f0d-93da-c12bf15e29c9,521794d7-5c00-56e4-8d33-25b56adc47e5,bd4f5e7d-14bd-5424-bb72-ec0992f0f1e0,1aa10053-fedd-58b3-ba6a-fc14966a7ee7","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Socorro Area","Box Climbing Areas, The","Northern Box areas","Red Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":5,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c/d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":10,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":5,"intermediate":4,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":12,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":4,"advanced":5,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":8,"intermediate":8,"advanced":6,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.9885,34.0045]},"bbox":[-106.9890424169187,34.00405033981814,-106.98795758308128,34.00494966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106096063","area_id":"GqEAU/7dWLO6avwUlmp+5w=="},"content":{"description":"Red Wall is the tallest cliff at Socorro Box, about 170' tall. It faces southwest and gets sun from late morning to late afternoon. About 15 climbs are on Red Wall- some are decent moderate sport climbs, and some trad climbs. Many of these stop about halfway up, but a few lines continue all the way up. In general, the 2nd pitches (other than \"Big Red Roof\") are not worth it; the rock is less good and the climbing easier... but it is worth going to the top once for the experience. The Corner Block, at the left end of Red Wall, hosts 5 more routes too. Despite its height and fun climbing, Red Wall is less popular than some of the other cliffs nearby, perhaps because of incomplete info and that many older climbs require gear to supplement bolts for protection.As with the rest of the Box, the rock looks suspect but is quite solid."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":22,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:43.504Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:07.972Z"}
