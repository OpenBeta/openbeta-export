A deceivingly easy start is following by gradually increasing difficulty as the route begins to follow a fist-jammable crack. Near the top of P1, a crux roof is encountered, well-protected if you still have a #2 camalot on hand. There is a potentially detached block prior to this, but it can be largely avoided with some careful climbing. Due to rope drag and the change of direction from the beginning of the climb to the upper section, double or twin ropes are advised. \n\n From the base of the climb - Head up the right side of the mini alcove towards a small tree just before toping out on a flat platform (beware the choss blocks on the left). Once at platform, head to the dihedral to then pop out onto the face of the wall.\n\n From the face of the wall - Follow the crack up the most obvious line towards a resting spot just beneath the crux mini roof. Potential loose rock if you veer too far to right, leading to In The Pocket’s upper section, but plenty of space for solid protection. Once at the mini roof, bump up onto the exposed face of the roof veering slightly left - this leads to a nice grassy platform. Continue right, up the chossy chimney before topping out of the climb. Potential lose rock while topping out.\n\n Descent is a walk off to the north.","protection":"Standard Trad Rack and Natural Anchor","location":"The base of the route is the first prominent mini alcove you will find on the outside left as you enter The Fin area."},"__v":0},{"_id":"LWPTWoAIV5ulWtCPTZI0hA==","name":"In the Pocket","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.57724,32.36825]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107924652","mp_crag_id":"107924624","climb_id":"LWPTWoAIV5ulWtCPTZI0hA==","areaRef":"FHQv3Sb+XFuyLpTNlAQnGg=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the crack for about 12 feet, traverse left (do Not go to the end of the crack) and continue up the weakness.
