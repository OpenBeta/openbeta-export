According to Ingraham's description of the Broken Rib, the middle and upper sections have never been traversed (nor climbed?) web.nmsu.edu/~amato/ingrahamguide/RE_Massif/RE_Massif_master.html.  \n\n  As recently confirmed, the middle section indeed tops out as an extremely thin axe blade of granite that will likely remain un-traversed until the ready-to-go portions are trundled (see photos). The south wall of the upper middle section appears to harbor potential for at least one very difficult trad climb, but bolts would likely need to installed for rappelling back down. The easiest way to reach the upper middle section of the Broken Rib is via the gully between the Long/Broken. Ascending the gully involves some short sections of scrambling (3rd/4th) in addition to a short pitch (5.7?) to bypass a large chockstone."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:47.089Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:12.251Z"}
