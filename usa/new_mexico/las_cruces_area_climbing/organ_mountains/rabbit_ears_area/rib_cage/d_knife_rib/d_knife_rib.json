It also forms the southern boundary of Rabbit Ears Massif just north of Big Windy Canyon. The best climbing rock is probably along the south wall, if not along the rib spine itself, but a verdict awaits further exploration. A few routes on Knife Rib are described in Ingraham's guide web.nmsu.edu/~amato/ingrahaâ€¦ Due to the geometry of the area, the south wall of Knife Rib is likely a winter-only climbing destination."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:47.089Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:29.426Z"}
