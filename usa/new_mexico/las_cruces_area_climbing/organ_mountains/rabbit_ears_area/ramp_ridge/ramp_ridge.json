After climbing the entire length of the ramp up to the SW corner of Ramp Ridge, take to a vertical 20-30ft off-width/chimney (crux). Finish by climbing a left-leaning crack feature. The rock quality is quite good.\n\n We climbed The ramp in three pitches as described below, but there are numerous options/alternatives.\n\n P1 (5.6, 80ft): climb the ramp until it possible to traverse slightly right to a good belay stance (more particularly, belay seat) on a east-west ridge.\n\n P2 (5.7+, 150ft): continue up the ramp, with one somewhat exposed move made easier thanks to a high left jug. Arrive on a platform atop the ramp, and climb an obvious chimney/off-width.\n\n P3 (5.7, 70ft): climb a left leaning crack to the summit of Ridge Ridge.","protection":"Bring a double rack in Camalot 0.3 to 3, with a few smaller pieces and perhaps a #4, and plenty of slings for extension. To get down, we scrambled down a bit to the left/NNE and did a 25m rap off of webbing tied around a pinch between boulders. From there, it's a short walk down the gully north of Ramp Ridge back to the start of the route.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,2635f237-5277-5a1d-9d74-99b35e3cd3b9,60af20ff-2a39-5a85-86f5-9582969e2458,6a0aec06-4561-5200-b345-f54acd82b72a,a14bf1ff-4975-5013-bfff-029fccc6ac6d","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Las Cruces Area Climbing","Organ Mountains","Rabbit Ears Area","Ramp Ridge"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.58611,32.36828]},"bbox":[-106.58664237884287,32.367830339818134,-106.58557762115714,32.36872966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116360901","area_id":"oUvx/0l1UBO//wKfzMasbQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.58664237884287,32.367830339818134],[-106.58557762115714,32.367830339818134],[-106.58557762115714,32.36872966018186],[-106.58664237884287,32.36872966018186],[-106.58664237884287,32.367830339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is a smallish crag just up the hill from (NNE of) the Fin/Southern Comfort/Northern Exposure area.
