You arrive at a comfortable ledge. Mantle onto a chest-high crescent crack and clip into the bolt. Then search to the left for any avail¬able holds. The secret here is to ooze leftward, then get the left foot high onto \"The Great Grey Foothold,\" which certain negative spirits have classified as a mere discoloration of the rock. You go up some 10 to 15 feet without any decent holds, then seize a good finger hold and traverse left to security. The summit is 20' away. \n\n  Apex Variation of P4: (first ascent: Dick Ingraham, George Goedecke, 5.6) When the \"overhanging bit\" is reached, go up right for a very steep section of 10 to 15 feet with a sort of layback. Thus you get into a V-shaped cleft, descending from the apex of this triangular face, and occupied by a clinging tree. Chimney out at the top through this tree. \n\n  Frank's Variation: (First ascent: Frank de Saussure, Ron Thomas, 5.6) When the belay spot for the forth pitch of Route 3 is reached, go right along the \"large fault\" another 30 feet. Then traverse left and up toward the \"Apex\" on small holds. You arrive at the cleft, occupied by the clinging tree. Finish as in Apex Variation above.","protection":"Any bolts mentioned in the description are likely to be quite old/ancient.","location":"On West Face of South Rabbit Ear.  \n\n  Take to the pretty, miniature, triangular West Face, about 300 feet high at a prominent shoulder, which projects out of it at the bottom, somewhat left of center.
