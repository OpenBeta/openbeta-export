The first pitch goes up 40-50' to the top of a sloping ledge on the right part of the dihedral. (It's best to belay here because of rope drag on the next pitch.)  \n\n  Next, cross the dihedral and take to a vertical bit on its left wall with just the necessary holds. About 30 feet up, go right into the dihedral and belay from a nice little standing ledge about 50' above the belayer.  \n\n  On the last pitch, climb the right side of the dihedral, using good footholds on the left side at a crucial point. Climb left and join the Miracle Route about 50' above the belay. The climb finishes at the \"spacious level area\" above the Awful Buttress. Go up a pitch and return by a rappel down into Boyer's Chute as for Awful Buttress.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"QP2rMNIgXwWhk7y7Q8/pxQ==","name":"Boyer's Chute","yds":"5.4","grades":{"yds":"5.4","french":"4a"},"fa":"J.

The climbing is easy (5.2), but many climbers may want to rope up to avoid exposed slab moves. \n\n  Continue into the chute proper and up it. This is generally best done unroped. Easy, even walkable, terrain is interrupted by harder but short steps. Low height above ground and the closed, chimney-like confines of the chute make climbing feel fairly secure. The stretch of more consistent scrambling is also only 4th class if that. The chute will fork eventually the right fork looking far more inviting as the left one is topped by a large chock stone about 20 feet up.  The route goes left!  \n\n  Pitch 2: There are two options:  (1) scramble past the chock stone on the right without protection (5.3, but exposed and with a somewhat crumbly feel to the large-enough and otherwise solid holds near the top) or (2) climb on the left and protect in a crack (about 5.6 and close to vertical). Above the chock another stretch of scrambling follows until a 20-foot chimney is reached. \n\n  Pitch 3: Climb the chimney facing right. Exit is to the left into the broken rocks or climb on the right of them. The second block from the bottom is loose. Belay from two new bolts. This pitch is the crux of the route and may feel harder than the 5.4 rating. \n\n  Pitch 4: Start all the way left, deep in the corner. Move right on nearly vertical but well featured rock. The path of least resistance will slide a bit to the right, traverse left under the large agave, and continue the rightward slant to a level area with some trees. This pitch is often done unroped by experienced climbers and other variations of it exist as the terrain is generally forgiving. \n\n  Pitch 5: The easiest way up from the level area is to head all the way to the right as soon as you step up on the rock, then go left to break in the small headwall and scramble left over piled boulders to reach an easy ridge which takes you to the summit. If you rope up for this pitch, you may belay from the area of the boulders. (Low 5th or high 4th).","protection":"A minimal rack will be sufficient. I go with one green Camelot (the 0.75 cam works both left of the chock and on top of the chimney), a set of tricams, and a few nuts. A more conservative leader may take a set of single cams instead of just the one. There are plenty of trees for anchors as well as bolts above the chimeny and a rap station (with even a cable incorporated in it) for an anchor above the first crux.","location":"Use the Topp Hut access and go up Rabbit Ears Canyon. Turn left after the most prominent, and last, of the small peaks in the bottom of the canyon and follow either the stream bed or the ridge to its left directly to the bottom of the route on the west face of North Rabbit Ear. \n\n  As you climb, you will notice rap stations. Rapping the route is possible but not recommended unless you are comfortable scrambling down most of the terrain. It is far faster to take the south side rap route with only two rappels and bushwhack back to the start of the route from there. To do so, go southeast from the summit following cairns to a ramp. Careful, one of the rocks about half way down to the ramp is loose. It's about a foot across and round. Once on the ramp, scramble down it to a bolt+piton rap station. The second rap, from a nice ledge and over some scary looking but actually not that easy to dislodge loose rocks, will take you to the saddle between North and Middle Rabbit Ears. To get back to the bottom of the route, go down the gully and turn right well below the rock (near the bottom of the cliff the brush is fierce). Even better, leave the packs at the bottom of the main Rabbit Ears Canyon to start with and just go down the gully following a trail. \n\n  Rapping down the route: If you limit your down climbing to third a class rock, you are looking at about 8 raps. The rap stations are set up and are in good condition, but the vegetated, slabby and featured terrain will force you to use single-rope rappels. Even then hanging up a rope is frustratingly frequent and loose rocks can come down at you at any time. \n\n  The top rap station is on a tree just north of the route and below ridge line. Short and fairly clean rap takes you to the flat area. There is some tat there at another tree, but the real station is on the tree all the way to the south. Another good rap goes to a ledge. Scramble along it to the north and a big down to the next station. Slant your next rap a bit north and look to your left (north) for the next station. It's not on much of a ledge, but it's a tree, and it does give you a fairly clear shot to the top of the chimney. The two bolts there are your fourth rap. Do it inside the chock in the chimney. Here you start scrambling down for a bit, then rap again from the horn on top of the chock crux. More scrambling follows, with two raps over the steeper sections, with more scrambling again, and finally one rap at the bottom if you want to avoid getting down the exposed slab. All in all it's a time consuming way down.

Route-finding for the first few pitches can be difficult, and the straightforward upper pitches involve grunting through chimneys, wrestling off-widths, clawing over bushes, delicately treading over balanced boulders, and some  lichen covered rock. If all this hasn't sunk in yet, there's the name of the buttress itself... \n\n  Pitch 1-2, 250ft: Some variations, one of which is climbing 100 ft up a blackened corner to a nice ledge with a small tree. Off to the left of the ledge is a broad sloping ramp. From the ledge, angle up and right following mossy cracks, or traverse right for 50-100 ft and find a weakness in the rock above to gain the \"Bivouac ledge\", a large vegetated ledge. Many of the routes on the NE face start from this ledge and share the first few pitches with this route. \n\n  Pitch 3, 60ft: Take the large crack system at the back of the left (North) side of the Bivouac ledge which starts off chimney like up to a small chock-stone, at which point there are some good face holds off to the left which allow escape from the corner. Continue past an awkward bulge to a comfortable ledge off to the left. Build an anchor with small wires using a tiny seam at the back of the ledge. \n\n  Pitch 4, 60 ft: Probably the dirtiest pitch. Fight past vegetation over stacked flakes which are jammed into the crack-system. After 30 ft, choose between a squeeze chimney stright-up, or a crack system to the right. The crack on the right is dirty. It also is formed behind a pillar of rock which may not be that well attached to the cliff, although you don't realize this until you get to its top. At which point delicate face moves are required to regain the corner system. \n\n  Pitch 5, 120 ft: Crux pitch. Start up the chimney and gain the large chock-stone, then break onto the face on the right and up an off-width crack. A small seam to the right of the off-width offers some additional holds and protection (piton and old 1/4\" bolt). After a rest-stance, the off-width continues up for another 40 ft to the top of the buttress. \n\n  The top of the buttress is a sharp ridge dropping down into Boyer's Chute to the south. 400 ft of 4rth class scrambling are required to gain the summit.","protection":"Large cams (#3 camelot and bigger) are reassuring but not required if you're comfortable in large cracks. Aside from the piton and bolt on P5, no fixed gear is found on this climb.","location":"Awful buttress is located on the North West face of the NRE. Approach from Rabbit Ears canyons and take the first prominent gully which leads SE to the base of the NW face. \n\n  There are rappel anchors that can be found at the top of the route.

The convoluted nature of the peak and somewhat vague descriptions of the routes from the Ingraham guide combine to make for an excellent exercise in route-finding and general mountaineering skills.  \n\n  This peak once boasted to be the most climbed peak in the Organs. There is little evidence that the peak gets the attention it once did, the approach trails undetectable, the route descriptions out-dated and the summit register bare for the past 4 years.
