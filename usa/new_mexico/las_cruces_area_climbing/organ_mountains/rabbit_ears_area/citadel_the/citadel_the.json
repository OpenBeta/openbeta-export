It involves some meandering and plenty of route-finding, which makes it exemplary of Organ Mountain climbing. Doubtless, there are scores of variations on this route, but most of them offer good climbing on decent rock.    The overall character of the route is to find the path of least resistance. The first pitch scrambles up some easy ground on the west side of the Citadel, to the right of The Nose. Pitch 2 traverses left on the large ledge system taking you to the north side of the Citadel. Pitch 3-5 work up the ridge whichever way seems best. If you stay left from pitch 2, you end up doing more face climbing. One can easily end up facing a difficult move, or not having pro on this face, but there are many possible lines. The climbing eases closer to the top, becoming low-5th, or even 4th class for the last pitch. At the summit is a nice desert garden. Relax and read the summit register under the juniper tree. \n\n  There are some nice comfy belay ledges that stay shady most of the morning providing protection from the sun. However, protection from the wind, particularly west wind, is nonexistent. This is one of the windiest climbs in the Organs.","protection":"Standard rack. Some topos show fixed pins and bolts, but depending on how you meander up to the top, you may not run across these.","location":"Start of the route is a short way up the side canyon between Citadel and Rabbit Ears Slabs to the west of it. \n\nDescent to the north requires some scrambling/down-climbing. Scramble down off the summit and back to a small, exposed ledge on the north face over a 100' slab. Find the poot slings you have come across on your way up, and you can do a single rope rappel to gain a large ledge beneath the slabs. The east side of this ledge is a dirty gully which can be scrambled down. While you are scrambling down check out the cool roof system to your right,  several harder lines exist. \n\n  Once out of the gully, you can head east under Glad We Came and take the trail down from Clem's Folly to the bottom of Rabbit Ears Canyon and use the canyon to get back to your packs (hopefully down close to the canyon bottom, not all the way under the rock). Or you can head back to the start by the shortest route possible, down and around the base of the Citadel. This is a true Organ Mountain bushwhack, however, with at least one false turn to the left more than likely. \n\nDescent to the south: A pair of good bolts with chains is located on the southeast side of the summit plateau, to the left of the south rock pile. A single 60m rope is sufficient for the rappel. Bringing your walking shoes is recommended (for either descent). From the south rap, you will drop down into Rabbit Ears Canyon and walk all the way around Citadel to where you have left your packs (hopefully down close to the canyon and not all the way under the rock). \n\n  To reach the bottom of the canyon, go down the gully until it opens up and look for a large, dead tree.

It is home to several well established routes in a wonderful secluded setting. Dennis Jackson's guide only highlights the best climbs on this formation. There is still lots of room for exploration. \n\n  Coming from the bottom of the Rabbit Ears Canyon, the bottom part of the formation starts as a nearly vertical north-facing wall. The routes on this wall are all clustered near its right end. Murray's Crack is the right one of the two obvious off-widths. Finger Zinger is on a slab to the right of it and starts near a tree growing close to the wall. Arch Rival begins in the well defined arch to the right of that. The Nose is on the nose, as it should be. The West Ridge starts past the end of that face on the west-facing wall and switches back and forth between the north and west faces as it winds its way up. \n\n  If you go to the left of this cluster or routes, the wall becomes quite forbidding until it is interrupted by a large gully coming in at an angle from the right. The next section of the north-facing wall is set well back. This wall is shorter and routes start immediately at its east end with Glad We Came on the northeast arete. Next, in a corner, is Wish You Were Here, and then Styx n Stones.  \n\n  Around the corner past Glad We Came is Clem's Folly. Here the rock faces more east than north. \n\n  When the sun is high in the sky, it may tent to shine directly down the face for some of these routes, but there will usually be shady and sunny faces to be found here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":19,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:47.090Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:11.811Z"}
