Better route potential actually exists climber's right of this route, but we didn't see it until after due to circling the Three Stooges to the south on approach. This would be a good route for beginner climbers.\n\n Climb up super easy rock trending right, then take a left for a short way before taking a right and making a legitimate climbing move. This leads to a place where you can build an anchor in a horizontal crack overhead, in the shade. From there, you can coil rope, head up to and beyond the Larry summit, and eventually downclimb an easy gully back to the route start.","protection":"Single/minimal rack will suffice. I placed three cams (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) and a medium/large nut, and made a good anchor with #1, 2, and 3 camalot c4s.
