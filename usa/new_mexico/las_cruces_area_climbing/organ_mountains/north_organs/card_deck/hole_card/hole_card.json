The cracks as well as holds tend toward the small end, and there is just enough of both to make it both fun and doable.  \n\n  Your first landmark is the left end of a small roof. To get there follow a very shallow, featured, right-facing corner which starts some 30 feet up and then head for the roof. Turn the roof on the left and continue pretty much straight up. The climbing is pretty sustained, but does get somewhat harder toward the upper end of the route. Belay from the top of the formation.","protection":"Cams up to #2, but predominantly small. Stoppers.","location":"The route starts left of the center of the face from a mostly level area above some boulders.  \n\n  Descent: From the top-out near an old dead tree scramble down a steep, clean gully to a grassy area, continue scrambling, traversing some, toward the bottom of the canyon.
