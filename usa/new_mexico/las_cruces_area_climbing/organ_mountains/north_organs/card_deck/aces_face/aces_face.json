Nonetheless, it is a good, well-protected route on excellent rock, worth repeating.\n\n P1 (40ft, 5.7?): Climb directly up a finger crack to the small tree above. You can also scramble up a ledge heading up/right (low 5th), then angle back left (3rd class) toward the tree. Gear anchor in crack just left of the small tree.\n\n P2 (80ft, 5.6): Traverse directly left from the small tree toward the big tree with old webbing around it. This starts on a slab with somewhat hidden pro at first (small cams), then turns into a interesting, rather exposed sideways traverse under a small roof (big cams) until a step up gains the ledge with the big tree. Tree anchor.\n\n Note: P1-2 could be pretty easily connected, especially if you brought 2 ropes to help reduce drag.\n\n P3 (100ft, 5.7+): Â Step out left of the tree and onto the main face of Ace's Face, which has been hidden from sight thus far. Navigate upward on a system of cracks (nuts useful) until the angle eases a bit and larger ledges are reach. Gear anchor in cracks.\n\n P4 (180ft, 5.9): Locate a fist-width weakness in the roof above and follow cracks to it. Pulling over the roof is the crux of the route, fortunately well-protected. After that, follow cracks upward to the top and build a gear anchor.","protection":"There is no fixed gear on the route. Bring a double-rack from #000 in C3 up to #3 Camalot and a set of nuts. Don't forget plenty of webbing and quicklinks for getting down. We did the route with a single 60m rope, but two ropes would have permitted an easier descent.","location":"The route starts on the far right-hand side of Ace's Face, reached via a short scramble. Descent remains to be worked out, but in general you can escape into a gully to the south via at least one rappel and some scrambling/bushwacking. A good topo of the route as viewed from far away has already been posted.               \n\nCard Deck as seen from Baylor Canyon Road.
