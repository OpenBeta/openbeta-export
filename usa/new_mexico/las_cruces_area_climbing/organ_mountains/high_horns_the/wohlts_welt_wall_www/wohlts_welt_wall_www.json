We have found no evidence of previous climbing in the area, but we did find evidence of no one having ever climbed there before. Namely, there are a lot of often highly-precariously-positioned large rocks/boulders waiting to be trundled. The main part of the wall below a large roof is up to 200ft, and it looks like another 50-100ft could be tacked on by a brave individual willing to lead an overhanging crack that is probably full of loose rock and debris currently. Directly below this roof is a narrow ledge that can be gained with minimal effort in order to top-rope the possible routes below. Left (west) of the main wall are possible shorter and harder routes on clean looking granite. There is currently a lot of loose rock in the area, as expected for any never-before-climbed wall, so climbers should exercise extreme caution here until the wall is cleaned up during establishment of routes. It is possible to walk off the top of the wall to the East (then turning right/south... see photo under Near Miss route)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:45.999Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:56.788Z"}
