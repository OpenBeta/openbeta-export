It begins in a corner that has had recent rock fall, creating the route. It climbs a layback crack up the corner and turns out onto the north face of the Spike. Follow a left trending crack and lichen face up to a steep crack and a notch just below the summit. One can belay from this summit but it needs some anchors installed.","protection":"There is a fixed hex in the crack on the north face but I wouldn't use it. A single rack with doubles in hand size cams will sew this route up nicely.","location":"Begin the route on the west side of the Spike. Scramble up a bit and look for the brown corner. We left a rappel anchor on top but it needs to be replaced with some bolts for a better belay and rap station. One can rap off the south side of the Spike."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,2635f237-5277-5a1d-9d74-99b35e3cd3b9,60af20ff-2a39-5a85-86f5-9582969e2458,a7fc71c1-8b31-5ded-97d4-a1a17e51223c,e434612c-1d2e-52d8-b065-bbdd0352859e","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Las Cruces Area Climbing","Organ Mountains","High Horns, The","Spike, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.57891,32.3631]},"bbox":[-106.57944234833907,32.36265033981815,-106.5783776516609,32.36354966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107994781","area_id":"5DRhLB0uUtiwZbvdA1KFng=="},"content":{"description":"The Spike is located below the north face of the Spire"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:46.461Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:28.572Z"}
