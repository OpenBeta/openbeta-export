Sunny all year long, so it must get really hot during summer. Red granite faces with black water streaks. A mixture of nice solid rock with a few chossy sections, mostly in the cracks. Still a nice place to introduce beginners. \n\n  Access to the ridge from the north side of the pillar, right south of the Monks. There are two solid top rope anchors for the routes facing south (5.6-5.8). Quickdraws will do, but long slings would be better to reduce rope abrasion. A single bolt seems to be aimed at the southeast face and crack. A 5.6 southeast face could be the reason for it?"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:46.457Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:57.266Z"}
