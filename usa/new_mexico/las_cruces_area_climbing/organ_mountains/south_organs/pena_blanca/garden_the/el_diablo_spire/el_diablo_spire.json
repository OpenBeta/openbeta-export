The easiest route is to start in a crumbly corner and then traverse left to the crack. A little bit harder but more fun is the direct start which pulls straight up on the undermined base of the cliff at around 5.8.","protection":"A single bolt is located 20ft off the ground, at the point where one traverses left. Trad gear can be used for the rest of the route. If you climb the direct start, the bolt is your first piece of protection. \n\n  There is no fixed anchor for this climb, but one can be set up with a few wires or cams or by tying off on a large boulder at the summit. At least 10 feet of webbing will be needed to utilize the boulder.
