To reach these bolts though, one must lead up the crack/corner to the left. The climbing isn't hard, maybe 5.7, but the rock quality is definitely suspect. There are a number of thin cracks which will take nuts and small cams, but test them out carefully, as some appear fragile.  \n\n  Once the  anchor is reached, top-roping the slab is quite enjoyable. The divots provide interesting hand/foot holds, and there are even some deep huecos scattered about on the route. \n\n  Supposedly, one can finish up to the top, but it looks sketchy.
