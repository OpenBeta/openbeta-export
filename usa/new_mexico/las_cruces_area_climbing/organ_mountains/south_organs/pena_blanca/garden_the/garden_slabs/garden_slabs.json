There are numerous short routes up these slabs, which can be led or top-roped. Rock quality is variable, with the darkened cracks usually offering better rock than the faces, which tend to have a crumbling layer of patina. \n\n  When viewed from the approach, the slabs are broken into several separate steps: The first slab step is very low-angled and has an easy scramble to the top. The next 3 steps are divided by gulleys, and offer slightly longer and steeper lines, and various crack systems. The fifth step is actually Hybrid Wall. \n\n  The slabs mostly face south-west, which makes them warm, and exposed to the prevailing winds. Vegetation at the base of these walls is thick, probably owing to the fact that very few climbers bother to disturb the plants to get to these short climbs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:46.457Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:57.559Z"}
