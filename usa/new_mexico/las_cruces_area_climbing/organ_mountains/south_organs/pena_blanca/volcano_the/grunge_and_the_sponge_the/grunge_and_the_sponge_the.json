The rock shows signs of volcanic origin, and has 4 large \"tube\" features. It is very short, and has relatively easy climbing, making it a nice warm up for the area. Most of the holds are solid, but some appear less, so, and there are plenty of animal droppings in the deeper pockets so be warned. \n\n  There are three climbs listed here on the PDF guide. Sponge Hair Brain (V1+), The Sponge (V0+) and Sponge Bath (V0-). \n\n  The Grunge Boulder is larger but not necessarily better. The south face is steep with sharp crimpers that are not entirely solid. There is more potential for routes on this boulder, but finding solid rock is the main obstacle.
