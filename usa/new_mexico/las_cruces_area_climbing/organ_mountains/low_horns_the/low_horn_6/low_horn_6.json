There are some loose blocks around your feet here, but the handholds are plentiful and the climbing easy. Go up the gash for a few moves, then work up and right on a beautiful face towards the arete, or maybe head straight up the face. Continue up to wherever you can find to build an anchor. If rope drag isn't too bad, you could probably link with P2. \n\n  P2 - Continue up to a little roof system with a slab on the left. Do the crux moves (5.7) up the slab, praying the lichen isn't greasy and wet, to easier ground, then wander up to the summit picking the easiest line, with maybe another move of 5.7. \n\n  To descend, rap the S. Face with a single 60m rope, or downclimb NW to Low Horn #5.","protection":"Maybe a couple cams (up to hand-sized) and a few medium nuts. \n\n  As always in the Organs, bring new slings and quicklinks or leaver-biners to replace whatever aging, sun-beat tat you find for anchors and raps.","location":"This is on the East Face of the southernmost Low Horn, #6.
