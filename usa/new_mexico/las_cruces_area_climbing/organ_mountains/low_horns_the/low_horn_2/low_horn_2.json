Start from below the obvious off-width/chimney/gully on the north face of Low Horn 2. Climb up a bit, take a look at the North Face route which goes up the aforementioned gully thing, realize it's totally doable, but be lazier and continue WSW up the easy ramp you're on. Make an all-hands move on bomber holds (hands in wide crack) out onto the NW face with a small tree available for a right foot-hold if you're scared or mean enough to step on it. A few more easy moves past there and a walk to the left and you're on the top. Several trad anchor opportunity exists.","protection":"I think I placed two or three cams on this route, and when I did, it mostly because I had no idea what was ahead of me. A single medium or large cam can protect the crux move. Several Camalot C4 #2-3 or equivalent are useful for making a feet level trad anchor just below the summit (walk up around the corner from here). \n\n  You can get down by rapping off the north. Bring new webbing, etc, as there are no bolted anchors here.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"rwzeRVA8XGW2zCT6J7Fxcw==","name":"North Face","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"4 March 1956, H.

Scramble up a large ledge to one of two crack systems.  The left crack is wider, and this is the one we climbed.  Climb one pitch to the summit.  An awkward off width move is the crux. \n\n  Descent:  Either rap back down to the North (the way you came) or scramble down to the south and one very short rap will land you on the saddle between #'s 2 and 3.  Two Notes:  1) as you scramble down to the north, it almost looks like you can scramble to the saddle, but caution a steep gash prevents a walk down.  2) Avoid rapping to the south unless you plan to climb #3 as the gully to the west from this saddle is loose steep, and cliffs out.","protection":"Light alpine rack.","location":"Scramble up a diagonal ledge from the small saddle between Low Horn #1 and Low Horn #2.
