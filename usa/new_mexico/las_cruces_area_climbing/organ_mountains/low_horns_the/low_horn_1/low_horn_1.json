This face looks steep and difficult, but turns out to be a one-move wonder. Or maybe two moves... \n\n  Climb up to the bulging face and try to get some gear at your feet. I soloed this, so I'm not sure how solid the gear would be here, and a fall from the bulge wouldn't be pretty. \n\n  Stand up and search around until you find some really nice finger pockets on the bulging face. The rock here is excellent and the necessary move up to a good horn will be apparent from this stance. Carefully work your feet up and grab the horn. (crux, 5.10 R) \n\n  From here, find more gear and angle right towards a fantastic multi-crack system on more solid, clean rock that rises to the summit. Some nicely protectable 5.7 or 5.8 to the top. \n\n  To descend, rap right over the route, or downclimb to the North.","protection":"A set of cams, finger sized to #2 Camalot, and a set of nuts. Maybe doubles in hand-sized cams. \n\n  As always in the Organs, bring new webbing and quicklinks or leaver-biners to replace whatever aging, sun-beat tat you find for anchors and raps.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"hNGOLgQ5VySV8wapUJDizQ==","name":"North West Side","yds":"4th","grades":{"yds":"4th","french":"1"},"fa":"4 March 1956, R.
