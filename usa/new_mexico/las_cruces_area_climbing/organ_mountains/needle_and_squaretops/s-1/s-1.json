Start on the West Face, climbing up and left over featured, protectable rock until a piton is encountered below a ridge leading south from the north face. The step onto this ridge is the crux of the route, and is memorable due to the many hundred foot nearly vertical drop now visible at climber's left (east).","protection":"A few medium/small cams and a long sling are sufficient. The piton can be clipped. Or, free-solo the route like Tom Lepinski did on 2012-04-30.","location":"To get to the route, approach as for Squaretop. To get down, do a somewhat awkward rap (single 60m) back to the west using slings/webbing around a boulder below the summit block."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,2635f237-5277-5a1d-9d74-99b35e3cd3b9,60af20ff-2a39-5a85-86f5-9582969e2458,261a19b6-6886-5b81-91c4-7b7985469ba5,60b00133-70cc-5dd4-97d4-0c64bf56bd06","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Las Cruces Area Climbing","Organ Mountains","Needle and Squaretops","S-1"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.56536,32.34829]},"bbox":[-106.5658922611698,32.347840339818134,-106.56482773883018,32.348739660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113552267","area_id":"YLABM3DMXdSX1Axkv1a9Bg=="},"content":{"description":"Viewed from the west, S-1 is the dagger-like peak just north of and well below Squaretop.
