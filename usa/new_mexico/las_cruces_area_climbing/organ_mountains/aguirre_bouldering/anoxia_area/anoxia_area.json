Amazing boulder problem. Start on top of the boulder under the actual bolder and jump into the rail/horn. Traverse left a few moves and directly up.\n\n It's really only hard for 15 or so feet to the ledge on the arete, then it's 5.2 slab. But a fall up high would be horrible. As with any highball, cleaning/sussing the holds and moves on top rope is highly recommended.","protection":"As many pads and spotters as you can rally","location":"Can't miss this boulder if you went to the right area.Â "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,2635f237-5277-5a1d-9d74-99b35e3cd3b9,60af20ff-2a39-5a85-86f5-9582969e2458,ea7d5a44-2d62-5e6d-a459-29553b69f8c8,1af080c3-89fc-5012-83c9-b52aea6801b7","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Las Cruces Area Climbing","Organ Mountains","Aguirre Bouldering","Anoxia Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.55301,32.36932]},"bbox":[-106.55354238496814,32.368870339818145,-106.55247761503188,32.36976966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118689082","area_id":"GvCAw4n8UBKDybUq6mgBtw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.55354238496814,32.368870339818145],[-106.55247761503188,32.368870339818145],[-106.55247761503188,32.36976966018187],[-106.55354238496814,32.36976966018187],[-106.55354238496814,32.368870339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"Area containing the classic highball Anoxia"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:46.460Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:57.383Z"}
