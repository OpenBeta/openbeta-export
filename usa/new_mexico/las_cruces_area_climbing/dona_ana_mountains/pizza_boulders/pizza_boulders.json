Found on the western slope opposite of the Checkerboard Wall. A large number of problems face North which can extend the season here further into the summer compared to Pena Blanca. Check out Sven's Crack, The Roof, and Thanks for the Pocket Julie Newmar to get a diverse range of quality problems which have good neighboring problems.This area has become more difficult to get to due to a recent road closure, but with an off road vehicle you can still manage to get to them. If you want a more vehicle accessible bouldering location check out Aguirre Bouldering.\n\n There is a wide range of problems that can be found here established by old school crushers. Shorter people will often find problem grades to be sandbagged. The difficultly derives from the problems having limited feet options and spacing between holds is often clean and void of any features. However, these problems are very aesthetic due to these reasons. The projects that are left here for sure approach v10 and beyond.\n\n ***Access Issue*** Vandalism has been committed to the largest boulders by the main parking (ie the Pizza Boulders themselves). Rock art has been stated to be underneath the northern overhang of the largest Pizza Boulder, to the left of a large hueco. DO NOT try and climb the very obvious line that exits from this hueco as this traverses right over the rock art. There has also been an abundance of trash left in the area the boulders are in. Please exhibit leave no trace to minimize impact. People at the BLM will be notified so a clean up can be made to these boulders to maintain access.\n\nTrails have become overgrown, try and minimize impact as much as possible till they are reestablished. There are two main offshoot trails to the north of the vandalized rocks at the end parking lot next main Pizza Boulders. Also it is the desert so be aware of snakes, it would be a long painful ride back to Las Cruces. Cell phones have the possibility of not working in this area. Some of the larger boulders have bolts on them but they can be decades old, beware. There are many more climbs in this area than those stated, more effort will be put into this page in the future. Go adventure and experience an area that allows you to escape civilization in a breathtaking setting for sunsets.\n\nThe efforts on this page are possible thanks to the Lost Causes guide created by Charlie Cundiff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":48,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:45.427Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:56.602Z"}
