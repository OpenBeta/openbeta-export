The largest boulder has a number of interesting and tall boulder problems. There's even a fixed pin at the top for those who prefer to top-rope the tallest face which is about 20 feet tall. One of the nie things about bouldering here is that there are hardly any signs of civilization in sight. Hard to believe with only a short drive out of Las Cruces. \n\n  The rock quality of the largest boulder is quite good. Some of the surrounding boulders are a mixed bag as far as quality of rock/routes goes.
