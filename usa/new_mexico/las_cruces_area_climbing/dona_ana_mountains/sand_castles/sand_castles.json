The rock is pretty soft and crumbly but there are good routes to be had here.   With 1/2 inch sleeve bolts I could feel the rock breaking as I tightened the bolt down to recommended torque so I switched to glue in bolts which should be more secure.  I recommend that others developing routes in the area also strongly consider glue ins.   There is potential for a few dozen routes here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:45.427Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:56.164Z"}
