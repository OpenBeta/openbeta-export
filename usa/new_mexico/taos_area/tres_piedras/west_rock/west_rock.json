It is typical thin TP slab climbing.  With a difficult start followed by much easier climbing, this climb is either frustrating or unexciting, for most people. \n\n  The crux is getting established off the ground, prior to the first bolt.  Once your feet are 4 feet high, you're through the crux.  If you fall, the landing is flat and soft.  No harder than 5.9 from here to the 2nd bolt.  Soon after the 2nd bolt, the climbing eases considerably to 4th class.  You can angle to the left and build and anchor and scramble down the gully, or go up and right to the anchor for Eds Mind, from which you can rappel with a single rope. \n\n  Regarding the rating:    The old guide says: 5.10d     Rock Climbing: NM says: 5.9+     Taos Rock says: 5.9+ but shows it in the wrong location (where Ground Up is).   I say: The crux moves are harder than any moves you find on most 5.9s.  I think that if the crux was more than a few feet off the ground, this would be 5.10 or perhaps 5.10+.  In my opinion, being 3 feet off the ground with a good landing changes the rating even if the moves are the same. Perhaps it's best to describe it as a 3 move sequence at V1 or V2 followed by 10' of 5.8 followed by 4th class.","protection":"2 bolts.

It would be great if someone could comment on the intended direction of the route setter. \n\n  Start at the base of a nice crack/right facing dihedral. Follow this crack to its end, good pro placements throughout. At the end of this crack I placed two 0.4 Camalots, as I thought the face above was quite run-out. Gather your nerve, and make some friction moves. The next 4 feet or so after your last protection are the worst then it lightens up until you can reach up and clip a bolt (this is also the third bolt of Mad Bolter). After clipping the bolt continue straight up through the crux and some more friction climbing (undercling), and clip the next bolt. After clipping the second bolt you will come on another crack, and above are a few easy face/friction moves to a two bolt anchor. \n\n  An error in Foley's book notes three bolts on this climb, showing one in his photo-topo that should be located somewhere near the end of the crack.

Once gaining the blocks at the base of the climb, you can slide a #3 Camelot up and right. To your left is a flared crack that does not accept pro well. The next few moves, though not difficult, felt uneasy to me because of the skecho block. Continue up a good crack with excellent pro and through a bulge. Once gaining the bulge you will get to a slightly overhung, smooth headwall with a beautiful crack running through its center.
