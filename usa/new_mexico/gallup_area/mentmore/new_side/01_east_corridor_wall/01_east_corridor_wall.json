Starting out as just barely too small to chimney, it steadily narrows down, reaching fist-size at the very top.  The fact that it's just off-vertical, plus the presence of helpful crimps and footholds, keeps it at the grade.  This is probably one of the safest trad leads at Mentmore if you've got the gear for it, since the rock inside the crack is really quite good.  A great climb if you like it wide!","protection":"Bring the big guys!  The top is just barely narrow enough to take a #4 C4.  Everything below that is going to need 5s and 6s.
