This climb has interesting and tenuous moves on an arete of medium-to-soft (for mentmore!) rock.  Well-bolted, safe lead, but clipping the 3rd bolt is hard.  Be careful to make the first clip...the route starts on top of a boulder pile, and a tumble before clipping would be nasty.  Rarely climbed, so the rock hasn't been cleaned up and is still suspect.","protection":"4 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.  Rapping and pulling your ropes would probably be difficult.  Walk off by scrambling uphill to safe ground, then heading left to the end of the cliffs.","location":"Find this one at the far end of the corridor, around the bend at the back, where the corridor re-emerges from behind the Monolith.  Check Scott Halliday's route map on the New Side front page: this route is #8, \"Project.\"  Look for a sharp arete with some jumbled boulders at the bottom, and an obvious line of bolts.
