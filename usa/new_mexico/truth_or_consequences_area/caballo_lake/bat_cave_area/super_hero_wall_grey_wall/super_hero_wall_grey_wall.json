A horizontal crack/string of pockets provides your last pro before the ledge above the overhangs. Climb up left of the overhangs over less than stellar rock. Once on the ledge, go all the way left. There is some pro here, then an solid, if short, horizontal crack a few moves up over what is still quite steep terrain.
