The cave starts about 30 feet above the ground and is maybe 100 feet tall capped by a triangular shaped roof as big as 30 feet in places. This is a very spectacular looking cave with great looking rock. Most of the routes are going to be very difficult if they go to the top of the wall. Timmy F, Marc Beverly and John Kear have done the vast majrity of work preparing the routes in the cave. Only a few of the routes have been climbed to low anchors in the 5.12 range. There are a couple of lines on the left that could be 5.13's and the rest seem as though they will be harder. Please respect the effort that these individuals have put into the cave and give them an opportunity to climb the routes that they have put a lot of effort into."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:44.102Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:06.365Z"}
