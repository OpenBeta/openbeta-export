The wall sits adjacent the Cañada del Borracho stream in the eponymous canyon at an elevation of around 8,000’. This canyon has a number of small waterfalls and makes for a great exploratory hike.\n\n There are only four routes at the Drunk Wall, all in the 5.10 to 5.11 range, but you’re sure to have the wall to yourselves. There is potential for a handful of more routes, likely easier, if one is so inclined. The cobbles embedded in this wall are the largest I’ve seen in the area. They’re wild! The routes here were established in spring 2016 and have not seen any more action since then. Use caution on suspicious holds and the belayer should probably wear a helmet. The routes get some morning sun but are shaded the rest of the day.\n\n Realistically, this area won't see a lot of traffic but if you like your sport climbing adventurous with a relatively short approach nestled in a idyllic location near a stream, you might enjoy a visit here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:43.511Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:05.529Z"}
