This sector is the gently overhanging pink wall to the left of the Cobble Cave. No pockets like El Rito, this is climbing on softballs, basketballs and footballs! The overhanging part is about 55 feet tall to a vertical section which continues to about the 65'-70' height where the wall starts to slab out and the routes end. The matrix on this wall is REAL bad but IF it cleans up the climbs will be awesome! Some of the coolest movement in New Mexico on some of the state's worst rock! Don't let that stop you though, these routes are closely bolted and pretty fun."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:40.929Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:19.343Z"}
