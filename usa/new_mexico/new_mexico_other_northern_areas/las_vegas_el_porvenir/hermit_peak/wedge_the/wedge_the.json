Continue climbing to a ledge with a small roof above with a good .4 placement. Pull around the roof (crux) and continue up face climbing on beautiful granite until you reach a small roof under a yellow over-haning bit of rock. Traverse left to a large roof and belay. Climb up and right slinging a rock horn off the belay. Climb up and right towards the two small trees over a lot of loose terrain. Angle back left to a short headwall. Start climbing the scary headwall (crux) and traverse right to a good side pull. Continue up and right to the top.  \n\n  Descent: See Wedge description. Or, you could probably do a double rappel from the tree just above and left of the pitch 1 belay. This may be the recommended option as pitch 2 is very loose, runout, and the headwall has some committing moves before pro is available. Note* we have NOT tried this rappel yet and it is unconfirmed whether or not the ropes will touch the ground. Tie knots in your rope!","protection":"Cams 0- #5 or #6, nuts, slings (for rock horns). There isn't much pro on the route, but the cruxes are well protected and the gear is solid.","location":"After reaching the base of the Wedge, hike around its left side and locate the cairn at the base of Mica Folly (see start photo)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,5d8047b7-81d1-5452-944c-f367d74b9385,3999697a-a2f0-5607-800a-c14224eb2d3f,5ed751b7-e9a0-5746-bbf2-e5dfc8ee8552,19f1ae36-a6fd-5a7b-9419-c347a9ef4f0b","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","New Mexico, other Northern Areas","Las Vegas / El Porvenir","Hermit Peak","Wedge, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.42143,35.74215]},"bbox":[-105.42198400474832,35.74170033981815,-105.42087599525169,35.74259966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107088678","area_id":"GfGuNqb9WnuUGcNHqe9PCw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.42198400474832,35.74170033981815],[-105.42087599525169,35.74170033981815],[-105.42087599525169,35.74259966018187],[-105.42198400474832,35.74259966018187],[-105.42198400474832,35.74170033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"A prominent feature hosting potential for short (2 pitch) climbs as well as an easy walk off down the trail.
