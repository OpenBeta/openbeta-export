This route follows the steep right prow of Witch Tower, then moves out on a cleaner face. This route will probably not be too fun to climb because of the poor rock; if you choose to go for it, it should be because you want to climb this very cool tower and not because you are expecting a well-cleaned and user friendly sport climb. \n\n  For those brave few that choose to climb this route despite the above warning:   Start up a steepening black arete with killer pockets and jugs, clipping a high first bolt off to the climbers' right. Make a fun traverse and pull the bulge with the aid of a heel hook or strong muscles. A couple bolted variations exist here - climb what feels fun. After this initial difficulty, climb easier terrain on worse rock to smooth gray panel. The last two bolts present the crux, which is more tricky than difficult.
