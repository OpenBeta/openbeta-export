It's the first cliff on the right side as you hike up LA Canyon  and has 5 routes. About 50' tall; the rock is tuff and was better quality than expected (if they were at Las Conchas, they'd get climbed and people wouldn't complain too much, but are by no means mega-classic). South-facing, sunny.  A short uphill bushwhacking gets to the base. Currently (2021) all bolts on all climbs are missing hangers, including anchors. As a result, you'll need to get to the top to set an anchor, which is annoying and a seriously sketchy scramble (be super careful! I went up the left side but there may be an easier longer way).These are written up in Jemez Rock.  Word is Shibli bolted these but later pulled the hangers so as to do other routes.  I didn't sense any obvious access issues or feel like I was unlawfully sneaking around."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:44.883Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:10.556Z"}
