The rock is mostly welded tuff and does not offer very secure gear placements unless it is bolts or good ice.  \n\n  Bolted sport climbing routes exist in the canyon further upstream along the dirt road that leads to the Los Alamos Reservoir. These routes are seldom climbed despite being in place for nearly twenty years."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:44.883Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:08.082Z"}
