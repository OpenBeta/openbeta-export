It starts on some small pockets that go to a thin seam to more pockets to a finger sized crack that exits past a small overhang to some technical thin  balance maneuvers on less of an angle up to the anchors. The crux is near the top. There is a lot of variety on this wall to play on. It originally had six lead bolts, but was decided that the rock was too soft and that someone might end up getting hurt. It remains a good and fun top rope problem however.","protection":"A 3 bolt top rope anchor that can be equalized (recommended) with a 24\" runners at the top below a sharp lip edge.","location":"This route is located directly east across canyon from Wolverine."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,3301509f-ad6b-5cf1-909e-db85df0082bb,f9613619-90d0-5ee2-8200-950a4b29db95,b0deccfd-8eaa-5396-a62e-aba033671bb9,04e88266-f81a-508c-bb4a-2ccfdf9e35a6,97a767e6-c2b5-5a2c-8796-49177e157196","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Los Alamos & White Rock","Los Alamos Crags","Pueblo Canyon Areas","School Canyon","School Canyon Ice and Mixed"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"mixed":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.31754,35.89336]},"bbox":[-106.31809506092955,35.892910339818144,-106.31698493907044,35.89380966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113189724","area_id":"l6dn5sK1WiyHlkkXfhVxlg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.31809506092955,35.892910339818144],[-106.31698493907044,35.892910339818144],[-106.31698493907044,35.89380966018186],[-106.31809506092955,35.89380966018186],[-106.31809506092955,35.892910339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":"Intermittently forming, short ice and mixed climbs on welded tuff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:44.884Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:55.786Z"}
