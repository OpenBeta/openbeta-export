It is not really worth the visit unless you are bored and want to devolop your own opinion. Perhaps the routes are worth doing at least once. This use to be a lot nicer when it was lush and not so deserted. This is the same type of rock that is found all over upper Rendia Canyon. There are four bolted lines that exist on this wall.
