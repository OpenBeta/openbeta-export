Potential for some hard sport and trad routes on overhanging basalt. I recall the rock quality (it's been more than a decade) as excellent. \n\n  I can't tell you much about the routes here, because Luke and I only visited a couple of times. I toproped some stuff, but I don't remember much about it. If you're willing to hike for 45 minutes to an hour, go check it out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:44.888Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:56.012Z"}
