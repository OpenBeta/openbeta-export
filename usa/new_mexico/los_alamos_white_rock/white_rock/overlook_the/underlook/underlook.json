Some recommend that you stick-clip the first bolt; others decide to go to the crack on the left for security. If you're feeling more bold, climb on small pockets and edges up the face - it's fun and technical and the landing is fairly wide-open and flat if you do peel. After the first bolt, sink into a large horizontal crack/ledge and repeat until the top. The grade eases significantly after clipping the second (last) bolt.
