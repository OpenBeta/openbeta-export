Don't fall on the cool 5.10ish balancy climbing that gets you to the second bolt. Style points for doing the slug mantle at the third bolt but the higher hand traverse also works. The first cruxy section deposits you at a cool stance below the spectacular overhanging-compression-slab crux. The hero finish is shared with New Mexican Graffiti.\n\n This climb is a rarity at the grade in White Rock- it's long, clean of sand and lichen, and on bulletproof rock from start to finish. Highly recommended and well worth the trip.\n\n Only two things detract from this fantastic climb- first, it's fairly height dependent (I thought it was reachy at a 6'3\" wingspan). Second, the bolting is sometimes curious. I recommend warming up on New Mexican Graffiti and hanging draws as you lower. You might want some longer draws.","protection":"9 bolts, chains on the anchor.","location":"Lefthand bolted line at Fun City.  Routes share the first two bolts."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,3301509f-ad6b-5cf1-909e-db85df0082bb,866936a1-51e7-50fc-b11c-1ac6a486f674,1ec549f1-f280-5d43-8eb9-2467af9575aa","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Los Alamos & White Rock","White Rock","Fun City"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b/c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.20209,35.80591]},"bbox":[-106.2026444491419,35.80546033981813,-106.20153555085807,35.806359660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118695010","area_id":"HsVJ8fKAXUOOuSRnr5V1qg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.2026444491419,35.80546033981813],[-106.20153555085807,35.80546033981813],[-106.20153555085807,35.806359660181855],[-106.2026444491419,35.806359660181855],[-106.2026444491419,35.80546033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"Among the more obscure White Rock cliffs, Fun City has 2 bolted routes and various other crack lines-- the book lists 4 routes but you could climb a few more lines if you wanted to make a longer session from the place. East-facing, really good rock, tall for White Rock. It climbs like Old New Place rather than White Rock pocketed-style.  I had a fun time.\n\n The access described in Jemez Rock probably crosses private property, but the cliff is almost for sure on county open space (I haven't looked at maps). Trying to hike to the anchors would definitely have a feel of being right in someone's backyard, but you're out of sight when over the cliff edge.
