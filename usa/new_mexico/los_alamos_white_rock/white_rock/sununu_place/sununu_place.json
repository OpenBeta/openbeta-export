Garbage and other debris from above is present around the base of the climbs.  The quality of the rock itself is much better than it appears.  The area was developed by Cam Burns and Paul Fehlau. \n\n  The one major positive quality of the Sununu Place is that it is centrally located near some other finer crags, so if you get crowded out at one of those cliffs this is a good place to escape to.  It's immediately under the Old New Place, on the same level to the south of Below The Old New Place, or can be reached easily if hiking up from Gallows Edge. \n\n  Be concerned about people above you at the right end of the Old New Place inadvertently knocking rocks. \n\n  Like the other cliffs in this area, Sununu Place faces southeast and sees morning sun and late afternoon shade. \n\n  In the early 90s, the hangers were removed from these climbs and replaced with old homemade hangers; Scott and Joshua replaced these with modern hardware in early 2012.
