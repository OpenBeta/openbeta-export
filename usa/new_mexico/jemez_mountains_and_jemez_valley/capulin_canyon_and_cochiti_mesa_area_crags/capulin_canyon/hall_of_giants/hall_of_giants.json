Once at the ledge, the most fantastic hand crack on slightly overhanging but perfect stone with an incredible finish. Have to try it to believe it!","protection":"Triples from 0.5 to #2 camalots . A single 3 and a mandatory purple C3 for protecting the moves right after the bolted section. Maybe an extra #1. Bring draws for the 4 bolts and some extras too. Bolted anchor with biners (use draws to top rope!).","location":"Scramble towards the ledge on the left side of the HOG by tucking behind a large upright flake. The route is the rightmost line of bolts heading up a seam near the oak. Climb this to first ledge, stand up, clip 4th bolt and get to second ledge.
