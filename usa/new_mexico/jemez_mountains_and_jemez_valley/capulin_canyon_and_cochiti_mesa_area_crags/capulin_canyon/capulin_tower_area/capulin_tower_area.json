Balancy and tenuous moves on the arête go up to a final, tricky and committing mantle-type move to the top. It's really cool and amazing that the right holds are all there in the necessary locations to make this line go. There's very little face climbing potential at Capulin due to crumbly rock but this rock has been weathered and is quality stuff.\n\n Because the route starts on a ledge at the base of Capulin Tower Area and traverses the slab out to the left, when you hit the arête you're already 30' off the deck making it feel very airy.\n\n All the bolts were, of course, hand-drilled so it took some pretty solid effort to establish this line. It was certainly worth the work.","protection":"5 bolts to a chains anchor","location":"On the slab to the left of the base of Capulin Tower Area."},"__v":0},{"_id":"LwrcwRrLXamnSR5KRKlhNQ==","name":"Anachronistic Ethics","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Hagen Telg, Jason Halladay","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.38425,35.77443]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108411811","mp_crag_id":"108411739","climb_id":"LwrcwRrLXamnSR5KRKlhNQ==","areaRef":"q1Y7bwMkVH6R6jSug6aGCQ=="},"content":{"description":"A nice two-pitch outing that reaches the top of Capulin Tower but the first pitch is a great thin-hands pitch on its own and gets climbed much more than the second pitch.
