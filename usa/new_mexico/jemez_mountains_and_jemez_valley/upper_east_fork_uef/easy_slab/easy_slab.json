The best move on the route is right at the start past the first bolt. Borderline 5th class climbing continues up the slab past five or six more bolts to a ledge and a two bolt anchor amongst some vegetation.  Above here more rock looks tempting but hasn't been climbed. I've cleaned it on rap a bit and could be entertaining...   Maybe a good route for beginner climbers to get used to the rock at UEF. Or maybe not.","protection":"Six or seven bolts to a two bolt Metolius rap hangers anchor. Ironically, the first bolt that protects the hardest move on the route is a spinner because I didn't drill the hole quite deep enough for the 5\"  bolt. Sorry. That said, I trust the bolt.","location":"The route starts at the toe of the slab.
