Mark and I climbed this wide crack/dihedral/chimney thing in 2008 on gear, simul-rapping off the formation with one of us on each side of the rock. It was a quick, fun experience but with the bolted route Stemtastic now just left of the crack, I wouldn't expect any repeats of this gear climb.\n\n I later learned from a long-time Los Alamos climber that Ken Ewing and the LA Mountaineers climbed on this rock, and nearby Battleship Rock, in the 1950s so I'm sure this crack had been climbed prior to Mark and I climbing it in 2008.\n\n Climb featured rock up the dihedral using the grungy crack in the back for gear.
