Church Falls rarely forms top to bottom, but best bet is after a big snowstorm and in late December to mid-January before direct sunlight can hit it. Even in good condition, it can be dry, hollow, sunbaked, and brittle, so be prepared for a little excitement.There’s potential for a mixed line up climber’s right into the free-hanging daggers."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:44.450Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:25.488Z"}
