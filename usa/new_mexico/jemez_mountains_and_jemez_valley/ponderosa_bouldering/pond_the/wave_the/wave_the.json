On the uphill side is a short steep face with possibly the hardest problem at Ponderosa, The Core Problem V13 climbs through some very small edges and knobs in black rock. Also a convenient downclimb through the toilet bowl feature. The backside of the boulder is the wave itself, this wall has a traverse but the rock doesn't look very good. A couple of lines look as though they could go up the face but the landings tend to slope away.
