The wall gets taller the further right you move, in places up to 40-50 feet. In places the rock is immaculate and others it is complete choss. Chances are you will not see other climbers up here. There are a few bolted TR anchors along the cliff top and a couple of bolted routes, more will go in in time, several lines have been TR'ed with an eye towards making them lead routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:47.522Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:12.724Z"}
