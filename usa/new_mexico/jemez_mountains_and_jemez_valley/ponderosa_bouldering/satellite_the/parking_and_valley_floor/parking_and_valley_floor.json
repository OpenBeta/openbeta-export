There is a very difficult SDS on the steep arete. \n\n  The next boulders are side by side on the left of the valley. The first one (on the right) is huge and as of yet does not have anything on it. The second one which sits below and to the right has some thin technical face problems. \n\n  The next boulder that you come to has a long, low angle face that you will see and wraps around the right arete to another shorter face.
