With all the pine trees around the crack can get clogged with needles, it is a good idea to scramble around to the top and clean the crack out before starting up.","location":"Walk up the gully from the Pinball Simulator area till you can see the cliff band at the top of the gully. Work to your left untill you see a large detached block that forms a corridor with the main cliff and a large pine tree to the side of the enterance to the corridor.
