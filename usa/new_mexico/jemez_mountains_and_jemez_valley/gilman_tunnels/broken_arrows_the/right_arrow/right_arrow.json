This line is a good option for those who can't get enough of Hostile Takeover, but is probably the lesser of the two versions, and only slightly more difficult.  This version is also a bit more heady--the 4th bolt is mostly for looks, as it is nearly impossible to clip until such point as it is no longer terribly helpful. \n\n  Head up the let side of the arete with good sidepulls in the obvious diagonal cracks on the face.  Several good stances right of the arete are available in the first 10 feet.  Around the second bolt, move left onto the face, generally keeping the right hand on the arete, as the left hand works thin crimps and shallow cracks on the face.  Tiny footholds lead to an obvious break at the third bolt, where the holds diminish and aesthetic (though disconcerting) green lichen abound.  Several difficult crux-like moves lead to a desperate stance, eye-level with the 4th bolt.
