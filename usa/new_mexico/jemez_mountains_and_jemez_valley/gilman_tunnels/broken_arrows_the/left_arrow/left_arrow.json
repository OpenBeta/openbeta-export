The moves are actually pretty good, but its hard to notice, what with all the dirt, gravel, and bugs raining down. \n\n  Begin by scrambling up easy ledges on the south side of the gully.  Stem out to clip the first bolt, then scratch and claw your way onto the dirty wall.  A series of left-hand sidepull crimps and right hand slopers lead up the blocky wall right of the vague overhanging dihedral.  Several of the clips in this opening section are difficult, so use caution.  At the appropriate point, a large undercling/sidepull leads to a wide stem in the dihedral.  Watch for loose rock to the left.  Aggro stemming leads onto the hanging headwall, and much better rock.  A few more hard moves turn a shallow roof, and an oddly long runout leads to the chain anchor.","protection":"Bolts, 2 BA, helmet, facemask, bug repellant.","location":"The furthest right route on the Left Arrow.
