This area is known for having two of the steepest routes at Gilman.  If you like bigger holds on steeper cliffs, this is the crag for you.  Like The Broken Arrows, this cliff receives morning shade and afternoon sun, however, this crag faces a bit more west, so stays shady a bit longer in the morning.
