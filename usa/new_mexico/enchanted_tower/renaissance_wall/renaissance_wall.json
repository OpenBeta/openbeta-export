Some loose rock to start then a steep bulge on descent holds takes you up to a blunt arete on the right side of the wall. Move up this for a ways then back left onto the face to finish. Fun powerful and pumpy climbing. Suffers from a lack of traffic and can be a bit dirty at times but it is easy to access the anchors at the top and rap in to brush it if need be.  \n\n  If you know the name of this route let me know and I will post it.","protection":"5 bolts and anchors.","location":"This is the far right route on the renissance wall and climbs grey rock."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,5b65c63c-e7b8-5f26-8c69-53f81b1e139c,a4d0c55e-3e10-55b2-b2c2-a6968014aed4","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Enchanted Tower","Renaissance Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.9193,34.23689]},"bbox":[-107.91984390966148,34.23644033981814,-107.9187560903385,34.23733966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106318655","area_id":"pNDFXj4QVbKywqaWgBSu1A=="},"content":{"description":"Very sunny mostly south facing cliff.
