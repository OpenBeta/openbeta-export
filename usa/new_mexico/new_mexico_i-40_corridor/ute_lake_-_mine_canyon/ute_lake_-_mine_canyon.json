Although nothing here is really above V3 in terms of difficulty, the quality of rock is pretty good and off the beaten path.    There are two walls here, the one you can see from the road driving in is Red Wall. On the opposite side of the canyon is Shady Wall. I know these aren't the most creative names but this is just to prevent any confusion. Most of the climbs are on Red Wall.    This wall is in the Mine Canyon State Rec. Area and you need to get a sticker which costs $5 at the booth. It is on the honor system."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:40.469Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:58.110Z"}
