I've always called it The Block, so I'm using that for now.\n\n There are two bolted (mixed?) routes on the North face which were apparently put up by John Duran. If anyone has grade/name/FA info to share, please let me know and I'll post the routes. The route to climber's right has older darker bolts, the route to the left has silver newish bolts. I believe both routes need gear above the last bolts you can see from the ground. The lower section of both routes is polished/slick and the routes look 10+/11 in grade.\n\n A two bolt anchor exists on a large intermediary ledge above these routes about 100ft up with hangers dated 2000. As of March 2020, there are two locking carabiners on the anchors for rappelling. This anchor is not visible from the ground. It can be accessed by leading/soloing up a 5 easy chimney in the middle of the west side of the block. Once at the top of the chimney, traverse climber's left to the northeast side of the block and look for the anchor atop a block. A top rope can be set on the N, NE and NW sides of the block using this anchor. Bring 20+ feet of material to extend the anchor to eliminate drag while belaying below. A 60m rope just gets to the bottom so probably better to bring a 70m.\n\n The NE face of the block looks protectable with gear. We found two stacked pitons and a bolt on the east side. See the photo showing the location of pitons/bolt.\n\n There may be a second anchor at the very top of the block but I haven't explored the very top yet.\n\n VIDEO: youtu.be/U6Eia-yUj9M"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:48.604Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:15.339Z"}
