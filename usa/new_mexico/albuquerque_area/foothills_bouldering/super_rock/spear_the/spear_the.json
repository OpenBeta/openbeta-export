The problem starts on the northern corner of the east face of The Spear. The starting foot is fairly obvious, and the hands come with it. Keep your hands on the arete and get your left foot on the basalt protrusion. After moving your hands up, switch your left foot over the right-foothold and then make final grab (like a bearhug) at the top of the Spear. Careful as the rock is a little pebbly, but all of the major holds are solid.","protection":"A pad would definitely help, but the landing is pretty good.","location":"The problem is located on the west side of the trail, just south of where the trail links up with Trail 365.
