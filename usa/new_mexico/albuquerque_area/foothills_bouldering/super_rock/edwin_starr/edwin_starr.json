Start with hands in the crack and feet on the low large hidden hold. Move up the crack until it fades. The crux is transitioning’ from here to the larger higher crack. Follow the higher crack back left and around the arete to top out on the slab. I think this is the most obvious line on the boulder. A bit high, but the top half is much easier and you can step off the crux easily. A good one to work. The best way off this boulder is down climbing “Glorified Jobs Program” on the far side, so make sure you're comfortable with that before committing.","protection":"A pad or two.
