There are a couple of moves that feel weird but are solid. Holds are good. You should ideally sit-start with a drop knee in your left leg while kind of in a splits position. The start feels awful until you do it. Once you pull yourself up on the two far apart holds you won't mess it up again. Dyno to the hold high above your left hand. Use the crack to top out. This problem is named to honor Max's 4 fingers which lost a ton of skin. The dyno hold is almost a jug, it's amazing but it is SO sharp. Tape might be nice.Moves are weird enough and beta intensive enough to make this a V4, but they don't require a ton of strength so we decided on a meager V4-.","protection":"Pads and spotters are highly recommended.
