The start is somewhat reachy as the best starting holds are about 5 1/2 feet apart. \n\n  Start with the right foot on a crystal and the left on a heal scum. Slap the left hand up the arete twice, moving your right foot up between slaps, to an OK sloper near the lip. Toe down with the right foot to reach up to a close by edge that is small but good. Get a high heal out left and reach up to some terrible sloper then out right to another bad sloper. Move your left foot in to the first sloper that you slapped on the arete and rock over on it until you can reach a good hold to top out with your left.","protection":"Pads and spotter.
