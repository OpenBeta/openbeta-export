I fixed a line to clean it and also tr'd it before bouldering the line.  Later I added tr anchors.  We have improved the landing, but it is still a bit tall and there is a delicate move to exit.  Gently overhanging tips without feet lead to a strenuous thin hands slot and then the technical slab/seam exit.  I think it is about 18' or so.  This is one of the harder pure cracks in the foothills.","protection":"A big pad and a spotter or a gym rope and two draws.
