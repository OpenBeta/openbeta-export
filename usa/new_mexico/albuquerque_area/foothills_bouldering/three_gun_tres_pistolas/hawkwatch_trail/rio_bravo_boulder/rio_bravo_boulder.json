It has a gently overhanging North face and three other steep sides that although a bit short are quite featured.  This boulder has four very good problems and a few others that are shorter, but worth doing if you are there.  The best problems are American Music, the NE arete/rail, (Tweaker V5) the west roof, (Anger is a Gift) V7 if you hit the lip and traverse left to exit V5 if you go right)and the south roof (Rio Bravo V3/4).  The boulder is named in honor of the good Reverend Dr. Gann's PHD thesis.  It is probably the best boulder yet developed at Three Gun.  There is a striking crimp project left of American music that may or may not go and a number of silly eliminates, short variations and projects between the established lines.  This boulder is excellent for those climbing in the V5 range and is one of the few boulders around that has so many holds.  Flashing all the lines would make for a nice afternoon of climbing.  There are currently two V3s, three V5s, a 6 and a 7."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:51.065Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:04.375Z"}
