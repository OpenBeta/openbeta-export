That is Carlito's Way V4 named after the legendary Carlo.  This takes ten minutes from the parking.  Keep following the band and just above that there is a nice cube sitting on a rock bench with small knobs covering the face.  Walk a few more feet and you should be on the plateau splitting the Westside proper from Valhalla, the upper area.  Look straight up at a pair of two large boulders about ten more minutes up the hill.  You will pass a number of other boulders on the way that have chalk on them.  Valkyrie Fallen is under the first one although it faces the other way and you can't see it till you get on its west face.  Total time is 20 minutes if you find the best way marked by cairns, thirty if you get off track.  The trail is fairly steep."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,f2bfcdc1-9015-5cbd-9762-f469ecb317fa,249e13bb-7ec3-5c48-9485-ba011e641c1c,a3ee38ea-119d-52f6-a749-010cb9da8b59,2c815ad4-1294-587e-a55f-8f46b0bfab40","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Albuquerque Area","Foothills Bouldering","Three Gun (Tres Pistolas)","Westside, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.4442,35.0763]},"bbox":[-106.44474944654576,35.07585033981814,-106.44365055345425,35.07674966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107135330","area_id":"LIFa1BKUWH6lX49GsL+rQA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.44474944654576,35.07585033981814],[-106.44365055345425,35.07585033981814],[-106.44365055345425,35.07674966018187],[-106.44474944654576,35.07674966018187],[-106.44474944654576,35.07585033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Bouldering-about thirty established lines with potential for a few more in the upper range.  The first area, with about a dozen problems, is centered around a short rock band that will test your mantle skills.  The higher area, where you find Valkyrie, is quiet and feels quite alpine considering the short approach.  This area has a number of nice boulders scattered along the bench.  For the tenacious, you can walk another ten minutes past Valkyrie Fallen and find more bouldering along a tall band of rock near the summit of the ridge.  All of these problems have seen relatively few ascents so pull carefully.  The rock is generally quite good, but you are in the foothills after all and only minutes from home."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:50.360Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:17.278Z"}
