Step onto the quartz crystals and reach left up to a sloping dish with a very sharp crystal in it. It is also possible to crimp a ripple in the sloper as a sidepull and get your thumb on the sharp crystal. Reach right to a seam with a small edge formed by two crystals, then left to a bigger knob and finally right up to a better edge in a seam. You'll match your feet multiple times on the quartz crystals durring this process.\n\n If you are tall or temps are cold you can go straight from the sloper to the second right crimp.\n\n From here the holds get bigger and the angle slackens.\n\n The low lying down star off of the hollow flake definitely seemed hard for V6 to me.\n\n This is B3 from the Mayer & Moret online guide.

Start with both hands matched on the low crimp that looks like a crooked smile. Work your way into the start crimps for the standard (squat) start version, and continue up to the mantle finish. Lots of moves for such a short problem, with interesting body position and balance issues to contend with.   This is a tough problem to rate - it's tricky to read, but once you've got it dialed it gets substantially easier. I've heard it called V7 by strong climbers, looks like some people think it's V5.
