More beta intensive than the harder problem, it took Chis and I more tries to do this than The 10, but once we figured out the beta we each did it on our subsequent attempt. \n\n  Make the same first shouldery move out right to a good edge. Then cross under to a good sidepull and a small move to a good edge. Get your feet situated and cross over to a sidepull. Roll out of this to some badness on the blunt arete.
