Pull up and your right hand can move to a crimp just to the left of the crack. Move your left hand to the other crimp on the flat side of the rock. Put your right foot where you started your hands. Stand up and you're done. It's an interesting climb that took a few tries. It would be significantly more difficult if I wasn't 6'4\" and have a huge reach (along with really long legs). The boulder sitting to the right of the one you're trying to climb can be helpful to put your right foot on.","protection":"Crash pad","location":"It's not very far off the ground, so getting off is no problem"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,f2bfcdc1-9015-5cbd-9762-f469ecb317fa,249e13bb-7ec3-5c48-9485-ba011e641c1c,2060eae5-78f8-5e17-93e2-bcd35b795df0,2bd7c0c9-4196-593d-b2bb-4fe18946f0da,59c685b1-b956-5193-9ed3-c39d39fc7dab","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Albuquerque Area","Foothills Bouldering","Manitoba/Montgomery Trailhead","Warm up boulders","Boulder 3"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.4829,35.1376]},"bbox":[-106.48344985995261,35.13715033981813,-106.48235014004737,35.13804966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108105251","area_id":"WcaFsblWUZOe08OdOfx9qw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.48344985995261,35.13715033981813],[-106.48235014004737,35.13715033981813],[-106.48235014004737,35.13804966018186],[-106.48344985995261,35.13804966018186],[-106.48344985995261,35.13715033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is really a few boulders, but they're all right next to each other.
