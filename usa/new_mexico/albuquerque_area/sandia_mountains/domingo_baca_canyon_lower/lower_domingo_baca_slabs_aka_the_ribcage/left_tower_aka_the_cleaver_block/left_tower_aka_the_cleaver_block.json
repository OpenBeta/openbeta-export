Be aware there is a semi-detached chunk of rock in this section, about the volume of a soccer ball. \n\n  The first ascent party, Gary Lee Hicks and Florian Walchak, then followed the crack up & left to finish up the wide vertical crack: steep and smooth-ish rock with increasing risk of pendulum. \n\n  Alternatively, after the vertical portion, we exited up and right where the crack turns left.  That way, listen for the loud 'n scare-y \"boing\" while facing an alarming lack of crimpers / knobs, increasing difficuilty for a bit, and no more pro. \n\n  Descend via modern rap bolts.","protection":"For the way we did it: Half inch to two inch wired stoppers and cams.

Nearer the upper part of the vertical crack, a half inch cam or similar offset cam might be nice.","location":"Set a belay on the small table-top ledge at the SE corner of the tower - protect belayer from upward pull into roof.
