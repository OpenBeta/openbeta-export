Starting from the left (west) side of the Upper Dome's south face, traverse right, walking atop a large flake.  Keep traversing right past the end of the flake, proceeding along an inobvious but easy line, to the base of the three cracks, which then lead to the top.   See the photo topo in the excellent online guide.","protection":"Singles of nuts and cams, to 3\".  The traverse, while not difficult climbing, is sort of hard to protect for either the leader or the second.  Gear anchor on top, with a bomber body stance behind the summit boulder.","location":"Starts under a triangular roof near the western side of the dome's south face.  Walk off the back of the dome (with a slightly bouldery downclimb to get off the summit proper)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,f2bfcdc1-9015-5cbd-9762-f469ecb317fa,a291d1d8-8f03-5991-bd12-b6d9de7bd0b5,101ec33b-0533-5e30-b307-af70ebda2806,2e5ccad4-dc3d-53ee-8e75-d2e888a37bcf,1a77391a-c127-5fed-9873-7b81080fb380","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Albuquerque Area","Sandia Mountains","Domingo Baca Canyon, Lower","Lower Domingo Baca Slabs (AKA: The Ribcage)","Upper Dome"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.4631,35.1805]},"bbox":[-106.46365015001501,35.18005033981814,-106.46254984998498,35.18094966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106336636","area_id":"Gnc5GsEnX+2Yc3uBCA+zgA=="},"content":{"description":"This small dome forms the summit of the Ribcage crags.
