Double rope rappel from bolts with rings.  An easy slab for beginners of all sizes and shapes.  Success of reaching the top is likely.  Rock quality is good.  The named routes are very easy.  One can find some moves up to 5.6 by beginning at the steepest part of the slab.  Developed in the Girl Scout spirit of being nice to mother nature. \n\n  History:  Probably old. but the FKA for now:  A dad of girl scouts discovered this slab while helping with a girl scout camping trip.  He wandered up Cake Walk in approach shoes and decided a rap anchor would be good for discouraging the obvious walk off.  The walk-off is arguably about as treacherous as climbing back down the slab but it is tempting and using it will cause substantial soil erosion.  The alternative anchors at the top are cams (size 5 to 7), big bros, etc. and nobody wants to leave those behind.  With chain anchors, it is a great easy place to bring the kids for some climbing success.  Please do not add bolts for leading.  The FA was free solo and a handful of gear will get the beginning leader up Cakewalk.  Rock jocks might scramble, sans gear, to set the double-rope top rope.  Then one can top-rope most of the slab."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:49.029Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:33.234Z"}
