Climb up just right of the arete.  Clip the fixed gear and climb the arete through the lower crux section in the first 30 feet.  Continue up the arete or just to the right making sure to not miss any gear opportunities. The second crux comes at about 70-80ft up on the technical and exposed upper arete.  After the crux continue on easier 5.10 terrain to the top and a fixed anchor.  The climb seems to be in the 5.11+ range by consensuses it is technical, powerful, and heady, a must do for any Sandias hardperson.","protection":"Bring a selection of small stoppers and RP's, small cams and 1, 2\" piece for pro near the top.
