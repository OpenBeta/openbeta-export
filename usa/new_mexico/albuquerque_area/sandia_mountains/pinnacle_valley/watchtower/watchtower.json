FA?? This route is a variation for the second pitch of The Watchman's Secret. After first pitch of Watchman's, head straight up and slightly right after anchor. (Left line = second pitch of original route). Climb over bulge on easy 5.9 terrain via runout bolts and iffy gear to reach glorious horizontal finger crack traverse. With delicate feet and superior crimps, clip two stacked bolts and pull onto vertical face. Layback thin vertical crack, either run-out to next bolt or place a 0.4 cam in flaring, shallow crack and convince yourself it'll hold. Finish on technical bulges and slab to reach anchor for final pitch of Watchman's Secret. PG 13 pro for sure but bomber rock. Crux is transitioning from horizontal to vertical crack (well protected).

Then ascend the flake followed by climbing a left trending dihedral above the belay to a bolted anchor.\n\n P3 (5.7-5.8): Traverse left, then up and right, then up past a bolt (may be difficult to see). Continue mostly straight up until finding a short vertical crack above a small horizontal ledge: gear anchor from about 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches (useful cams: Â 0.5\" & 1\").\n\n P4 (5.8): Seventh Sojourn proper continues mostly straight up and through a small chimney/roof and then to the top. Gear anchor.\n\n If the leader runs out the start of the 3rd pitch a bit then the second can skip the vegetated traverse and instead get immediately into some enjoyable terrain (5.9?) - i.e., climb up while trending left from the belay through small features and a couple shallow cracks before resuming pitch 3 proper.\n\n At the top of pitch 3 and from the described gear anchor, the bolt visible up and left about 15 feet protects a few 5.10a moves of a p4 variation which then continues up past the 1st bolted anchor for the rap of The WatchTower.","protection":"Anchors from bottom to top are bolts, bolts, gear (1/2\" to 1 \" - useful cams: .5\" and 1\"), and a couple large trees a little back from the cliff top.
