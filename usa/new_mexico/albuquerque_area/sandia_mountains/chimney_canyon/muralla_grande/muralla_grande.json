However, the star rating of the route really depends on which way you decide to go on the headwall at the top. There are four choices for the final pitch (5.10d, 5.10a, 5.9, and 5.8). \n\n  Getting There: Follow directions to Muralla Grande. Soon after you get to the bottom of the couloir of death talus and rocks, begin looking to your right. You will eventually come upon an alcove beneath a large headwall (the headwall is high up on the route). If you round the corner toward the bottom of the hill at the base of the stone, you have gone too far. \n\n  Route: \n\nPitch 1 (~30m): Begin up the right corner of the alcove, climbing past a small tree. At the top is a large with another pine tree. If you plan on taking the variation going straight up, belay from the tree, if you are going up the chimney variation, it is best to traverse left to a spot below the chimney.  \n\nPitch 2 (~50m): 2 variations:    A- Traverse left into an awkward looking chimney, after exiting the chimney, continue climbing up over some loose rock to a very large ledge. There is also an optional intermediate belay with shiny bolts about 20 feet beyond the chimney.   B- You can also take a more direct line by going straight up and diagnaling to the left toward the ledge. I found there was plenty of places to put protection going this way.  \n\n  The second pitch is quite long and as discussed above the leader of the 1st pitch might want to set the anchor at the start of the chosen variation (either at the tree or under chimney to the left of the tree.) Either that, or the climb can be made into 5 pitches by using the bolt anchor in the middle of variation A. \n\n  Once attaining a large ledge at the end of the pitch, there are a few places to set a belay for pitch 3. You are aiming for the large, left facing dihedral. You can set up your belay below  and left of the dihedral, or you can move to the uppermost part of the ledge just below two fixed pitons (slightly trick anchor set up with some with a flaring crack, but I found solid placements to back up the piton.) \n\nPitch 3 (~50m):  From here there are a few different ways to get you to the same location. If you start under the pins, after clipping the second pin undercling a flake moving left into the left facing corner.    OR, you can climb from left and below the corner to eventually gain it. \n\n  Continue to climb up to the large left facing dihedral, eventually moving to the left to a right facing corner. Follow this corner to the base of the headwall. You will know you are there because you will see a beautiful 10a finger crack directly above you, and a 5.9+ crack going up and right. There is one bolt and a fixed piton here for an anchor. \n\nPitch 4: Four choices here. (a) Far Right, a 5.8 crack is the original finish. (b) To the left of that is a widish crack that goes at 5.9. (c) straight up and slightly to the left is a clean, steep fracture (very nice, this is the way we took! It has been noted that a double set of nuts is nice for this pitch, though I did not use that) that goes at about 10 a/b. (d) To the far left is a 5.10d crack, which I know nothing about. At the top is a large tree about 15 feet back from the cliff that you can belay from. There are also some newly placed bolts at the top of this pitch. \n\n  Once at the top, follow the trail that goes away from the cliff and eventually veers to the left, to the top. \n\n  Can also rap back to the base of the the climb if so inclined (see comments below) via either second coming itself or the route next to it, Rapture. \n\n  Second Coming: Takes 4 double rope raps. \n\n  Rapture: 3 double 60m raps, first rap is long about 190 feet.","protection":"Gear: Took a double set of camalots to #3 with a set of nuts.

About 30-40 feet below the chimney, climb and traverse right towards a ledge and a left facing dihedral with a water groove to the left of it. The rock here is very(!) clean and solid. Climb this short left facing dihedral (15 feet) to a ledge with several large blocks on it. Traverse/step left off the ledge of thin balance face holds, and continue up on good rock. About 25 feet above the ledge there are couple of slots that will accept the 1/2 and Â¾ inch Camelot. [Historic Note Â if you traverse hard left here for 20 feet you are on back on Warpy and have avoided the chimney Â this is the ÂShort and ThinÂ variation].  Instead continue straight up from these Camelots, with clean solid face climbing moves for 60 feet. The gear is adequate, but can be overlooked. There is a slot for a small nut about 30 feet later in an easily over looked slot (makes it PG). Continue until you hit a 1 foot wide ledge that cuts across this route as well as the Warpy line. Set up a belay under a small left facing roof which is capped by a larger left facing roof. As of 6/2014 there is a fixed nut marking this belay station.

This is 100 feet of hand jamming, with very few usable face holds. The crack accepts lots of good gear. This crack then links up with a chimney, which is easily climbed by stemming on the outside for about 40 more feet. Your ultimate target is an alcove.

We did another nice pitch straight up to the top of the Muralla via a crack system that split a steep yellow buttress (5.9).","protection":"Bring a good sized rack up to a #4 Camalot.  None of the belays are fixed, there are two bolts and a pin on Straight Line... There is also a pin near the end of pitch 4, although where it's at doesn't make a lot of sense to me.","location":"The route climbs the middle left side of Muralla Grande.

It is not as bad as it sounded to me as climbed in 2012 & 2015, the latter of which was a high rain year.  Still, if you like adventure climbing and bushwhacking and are solid leading 5.8, this climb is for you. \n\n  For route description, see Mick Schein's \"Sandia Rock\" (2003).  However, the below pitch counts do not match after the first couple pitches.  That is, the below description splits the guide-book P3 into two pitches for a total of seven pitches ... and may give too much detail for some (spoiler alert). \n\nP1 - 5.7 R-ish: Climb up aiming to track about 20 left of the right facing dihedral (see below photo). At one point work close to the dihedral for a few moves but be wary of poor rock on right face.  Higher, at top, veer left and up to big ledge system with a large block with not many placements for pro.  150 ft. \n\nDihedral marking start of climb. Tamara can be seen leading P2.  Notice the undercling arching roof.\n\n  There is just enough loose rock to probably want to station the belayer a bit right of P1. \n\n  A P1 variation starts further left at a tree:  Go up through a hand crack, then wander through suspect rock to the ledge system - top of this way is shown in this photo: \n\nThe first 2/3 of the route.  Zoom in on the accompanying unmarked version of this photo for more detail\n\nP2 - 5.7: Head left and up through chimney sections for ~70 feet.  Then continue ~straight up an undulating wide-ish crack in a sort of right facing dihedral. At 100 feet, traverse left onto blocks, where it takes effort to assemble a good anchor.  110 ft. \n\nP3 -5.5R:  Climb a little down and then left across a large ledge.  Just past ledge end, head straight up - run out & exposed.  Then continue up an easy intermittent shallow crack system to its 'top', and step left into a very dirty and bush-filled gully. Belay just above the bushes / dirt at the base of a clean hand crack with large chock stone just above.  Save 1 to 2 inch cams for the belay anchor.  100 ft. \n\nP4 -5.7:  Face climb right of base of hand crack. Step left onto blocks on top of chock stone which brings one to the base of an off width.  Head up the off width and navigate around / over a large stone at its top - seems solid. Continue up, eventually escaping left and up to a large tree on a large ledge.  80 ft. \n\n  Bottom of P4 OW protects with 3\" cam in it, or ~2\" cam/hex slightly up and right of OW. After a few moves up the OW and at a good stance, a 4\" cam works well.  Leaders at their limit may want a second large cam - 4\" or maybe 5\"? - for up higher. \n\n  Stronger leaders can combine P3 and P4: ~195 feet to tree; still, a fall on the offwidth is likely to land one on the blocks with that much rope out; communication may be very poor. \n\nP5 - 5.8: Climb the face that is about 10 or 15 feet right of tree.  The difficulty lessens around 35 feet up.  Continue up easier terrain and make easy mantel onto a large flat plate with a 4 to 5\" crack around a corner behind it.  80 ft. \n\n  To sew up the crux section of P3, micro cams and ball nuts are useful as well as other medium to small passive pieces; the 2nd and 3rd smallest of the Trango set of ball nuts found good placements.  \n\n  For anchor, a 4 to 5 inch piece is nice plus a medium hex / nut can be slotted behind a wedged chock stone.  In any case the stance alone is bomber so long as the plate doesn't pitch off. \n\nP6 - 5.8 but not as sustained as the beginning of P5: Face climb up, generally angling right. At about 25 feet, climb up through a right-facing dihedral.  Getting nearer the big trees, traverse right ~15 feet and then up intermittent cracks and into the trees.  150 to 180 ft depending where you stop. \n\n  If inclined to free solo the remaining route, belay follower from anywhere in the trees.  To set up to belay the remainder, end P6 by walking / scrambling up to the highest tree (1 ft diameter) on a dirty ledge or go even further up onto a minor rib if have enough rope and can find a suitable anchor - reduces rope drag and improves comms for P7. \n\nP7 - 4th class:  If not done, continue up across a minor rib, turn slightly right, and then climb up angling left through the easiest terrain.  This ends on comfortable horizontal ground at the top of Muralla Grande.  170 ft. \n\n  The P7 terrain is blocky, lichen covered, not easy to protect, and very exposed in places.  Communication will be poor if belay is back at the highest tree.","protection":"No bolts on this route.

This massive SW-facing cliff face is easily seen from Albuquerque, standing just beneath the communications towers in upper Chimney Canyon. The rock wall boasts many long, quality routes from 4-7 pitches, including The Second Coming (the most popular multi-pitch 5.8 in the Sandias), Warpy Moople (a classic 5.9 with a somewhat runout ârite of passageâ crux pitch for a 5.9 leader), Excitable Boys (a beautiful clean corner system and one of the most popular long 5.9s in the area), Little Yellow Jacket (5.11-, a great intro to Sandia climbs over 5.10), and Thunderbird (an adventurous 12- thatâs invariably on the hit list those who seek out this grade). The rock quality is quite good (about as good as it gets in the Sandias), except for the top pitch of some of the climbs. The approach is fairly quick (~30 minutes) and on a well-established climbers' trail. Most climbs will be shaded early (I've often been shivering at the first belay), but go into full sun by late morning.  \n\n  Although popular, Muralla Grande routes are a step up in seriousness & commitment compared to the shorter 1-2 pitch Sandia climbs off the La Luz trail and in Echo Canyon at the same grades. Over the years, many parties have reported having some routefinding difficulties on sections of climbs like Second Coming, Warpy Moople, and Little Yellow Jacket. Bailing off from most of these climbs will probably involve leaving gear behind and building intermediate rap anchors, followed by an unpleasant hike up the loose approach gully (so donât bail!).  \n\n  If you finish early and need more climbing, consider lowering in and climbing the various finishing pitches on the Second Coming headwall (great 5.8-5.10 cracks), or go over to the nearby Clandestine Wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:49.026Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:33.012Z"}
