(Seriously. I can't think of many individual pitches 5.7 or under in the Sandias that are as good as this one.)From the west side of the Cake and Candle, climb up to the notch between the two towers. The Candle is to your left. Start on the Candle by hand traversing to its right-hand edge. Follow the crack system on the exposed arete, passing 2 pitons. There are a couple of loose blocks to be careful with. A slightly overhanging bit near the top could be near the crux. Â Mantel-ing around there may be a little hard for the grade and hard to do with dignity; otherwise, a couple gym-climging-ish moves work well. Easy from there to the tiny summit. Downclimb the last 10' to the rappel anchor.Rappel down the south face from a slung block (90').","protection":"Standard rack to 3\" or 4\".","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,f2bfcdc1-9015-5cbd-9762-f469ecb317fa,a291d1d8-8f03-5991-bd12-b6d9de7bd0b5,6905afb1-152e-55f8-b91c-db5bf96bf786,95a92d72-d887-52ae-a741-f3b9cc0ffe17","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Albuquerque Area","Sandia Mountains","Chimney Canyon","Candle, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.45522,35.216]},"bbox":[-106.45577039050825,35.215550339818144,-106.45466960949176,35.21644966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108180571","area_id":"laktctiHUq6nQfO5zA/+Fw=="},"content":{"description":"The Candle is a striking slender 90' pinnacle to the north of Muralla Grande.
