A nice summit with forgettable climbing; rated 5.3 in the old Hill guide, 5.4 in the new Schein guide. \n\n  From the north-west side of the Cake, scramble up to the notch between the Cake & the Candle.  Step to the tower to the right (the Cake), and start up its North Face. Climb a flake, stem into a chimney and onto a ledge with 2 really old bolts.  From here, work right toward the right edge of the cliff, then angle back up and left to the top of the tower.  Or, from the ledge, you can climb directly up some hand cracks which look nice but pass some scary loose blocks (this was more like 5.6 and felt harder since I was trying not to touch anything).","protection":"Standard gear to 3\".

The Cake is the broader tower to the south of the Candle.  It's not as impressive as the Candle, but you'll probably climb both if you come down here.  The Cake is home to the easiest climb listed in the current guidebook, however, the approach might be a bit more rugged than some first-timers might enjoy. \n\n  To descend: Rappel 90' down the north face, off webbing around large blocks.  This anchor is not great. \n\n  I haven't done it, but I guess you can rig a tyroleon traverse between the Cake and the Candle."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:49.828Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:16.970Z"}
