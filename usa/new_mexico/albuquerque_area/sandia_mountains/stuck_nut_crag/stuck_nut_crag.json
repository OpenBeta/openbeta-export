There will probably never be any routes or bouldering problems listed.  That is, it falls quite a bit short of what most think of as a crag. Like other places in the open spaces adjacent to Albuquerque, those little summer-time flying bugs can be very pesky unless it is windy.\n\n  This is a great place for gear-anchor practice:  numerous cracks 1/8 inch to 6 inch at ground level or accessible via easy scrambling, all within a short hike from the city.  An aspiring leader could be kept busy making placements and building anchors for hours without repeat.  There is enough terrain to keep a handful of folks concurrently practicing the craft.   \n\n  Some of the rock is pretty fractured, some bomber, and some inbetween ... plenty of opportunities to point out the issues to a beginning leader.  It faces west for nice summer AM shade and winter sun in the PM."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:48.594Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:00.349Z"}
