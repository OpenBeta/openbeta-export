This route allows one to climb out of la cueva canyon rather than hike.     P1 - Starts on the left side of the slot area about 150ft left of Heat Stroke.  Climb a short and steep right facing corner to bulge stepping up and left to a small tree.  Clear the bulge and climb slightly up and right past a bolt.  Continue straight up passing a large scoop, climb another bulge and small cracks to a belay at 100ft. 5.10a   P2 - climb up and left for about 15 ft of good climbing then diagonal up and left about 100ft to a big ledge system with some large trees.  Belay from one of the large trees closest to the  wall above. 5.5   P3- Climb up and left to a bolt, the crux is an interesting step over just after the bolt. Continue up and slightly right following good edges and a sparsely protected seam until the seam eventually leads you up and left to a belay ledge at 100ft. 5.10a/b   P4 - Move the belay up to the next terrace 4th class.   P5 - Climb up a nice looking steep lieback crack the crack system is mostly fingers and thin hand size pieces, the lieback turns into a through and then ramblely face climbing to a number of belay options after about 100ft.     P6 - To get to the last pith of the route you need to climb down into a hanging terrace/forest and walk diagonally up hill to the base of a clean 30ft pillar.  You will see a bolt about 20ft up.  Climb the pillar and exit left across a ledge, pull a short steep boulder problem to another ledge then climb mostly straight up for 25ft or so until you can step left across a small ledge.  Climb left into a nice crack system that becomes cool fingers.
