I got to a point where I had real problems, so I put in a piton, used it for a handhold to get to a ledge. Was able to reach down and retrieve it and didn't tell Dave. He got where I had put in the piton and couldn't work out how to get up further. He was 5\" taller and one heck of a good climber. He finally saw the piton scar and I am afraid that I didn't know he had the vocabulary that he used to describe climbers that sandbag their partners.\n\n  South Ridge route is two or three pitches long - three if one starts climbing right off the trail.  We did it in two pitches by first scrambling and bushwhacking to a ledge with a medium sized pine tree at the bottom of a short left-leaning open book. \n\n  On the climb, we stayed on the south ridge but by doing so there was limited opportunity to set up a belay at our halfway point.  It might work to set up a belay at trees mid-way up the SE face (visible in photo).  Top out via the horn with a few pretty-fun moves.  This route has a fair amount of loose rock. \n\n  In late March, the South Ridge gets sun around 9:30 in the morning:  possible warm-up to something on The Pulpit.","protection":"Did not note any bolts or fixed gear.  Used quite a bit of pro less than 1/2 inch.  We found the rap anchor webbing in pieces and replaced it. Rap goes off into the notch and then we exited to the east.","location":"Obvious south ridge on Lost Spectacle."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,98c839d1-f0d4-5006-bb58-276b12f05bd0,f2bfcdc1-9015-5cbd-9762-f469ecb317fa,a291d1d8-8f03-5991-bd12-b6d9de7bd0b5,5da4957a-1cd2-54ce-86d1-5eaab3459e34,ed7c83ba-25a6-5f4f-9a80-b0460a5d4a12","pathTokens":["USA","New Mexico","Albuquerque Area","Sandia Mountains","La Cueva Canyon, Upper","Lost Spectacle"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.452,35.2063]},"bbox":[-106.45255032475414,35.205850339818134,-106.45144967524584,35.20674966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106136179","area_id":"7XyDuiWmX0+agLBGCl1KEg=="},"content":{"description":"Name's origin:  According to Reed Cundiff, \"Climb is named 'Lost Spectacle' since Charles (Bill) Williams lost a lens out of his glasses on the first ascent from the notch around 1956.\" \n\n  Lost Spectacle is a 200 foot pinnacle just to the north of La Luz Trail.
