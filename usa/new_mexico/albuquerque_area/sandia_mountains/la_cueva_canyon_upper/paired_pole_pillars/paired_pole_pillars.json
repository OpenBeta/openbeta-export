The crux moves are significantly easier with good footwork.  There is a block, after the first crux in the crack, which looks suspect but is solid.  In fact, one does pull on this large flake to continue upward.","protection":"Standard trad rack to two inches including about eight two foot slings.  Small wired are not needed.
