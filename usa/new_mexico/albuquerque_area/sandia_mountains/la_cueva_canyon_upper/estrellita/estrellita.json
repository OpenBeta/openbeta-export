The start is somewhat contrived, avoiding the prominent jug and crack features on the adjacent routes--hence only 3 stars. At about the 30/40 foot mark, the climbing becomes more intricate and stays unique from the other climbs until joining the top of Estrellita after it turns the corner up high. Technical side pulls and high steps abound, along with crafty gear placements at just close enough intervals to keep the whole outing sane (and exciting! )  \n\n  This route has likely been toproped before, but I discussed it with Bryan Pletta and we felt it had likely not been lead. If anyone knows of a prior lead ascent, I would gladly update the info.","protection":"Micro brass, doubles in 00 thru 1 metolius, a couple pieces for the top of Estrellita.","location":"Start between the two existing routes on the wall, charge straight up the face into slab oblivion."},"__v":0},{"_id":"fhQ/fLYAUmGCN3Yrk6f5mw==","name":"Clean Sweep","yds":"5.10a/b","grades":{"yds":"5.10a/b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Jim Linn, Gerry Peich, 1986","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.44949,35.20574]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105789320","mp_crag_id":"105789248","climb_id":"fhQ/fLYAUmGCN3Yrk6f5mw==","areaRef":"wADinCLLUn+b/iO87gOZ8Q=="},"content":{"description":"Far left (north) side of the rock formation of the clean face near the corner.
