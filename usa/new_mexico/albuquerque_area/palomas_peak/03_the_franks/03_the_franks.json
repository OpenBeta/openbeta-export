The route starts with a few good jugs before launching into a desperate series of lunges and deadpoints to get established in the obvious undercling crack.  From the undercling bear hug your way up and right, do a few obligatory Palomas finger locks, clip the last bolt, and cruise on to the chains.","protection":"Bolts, Stick clip","location":"This route can be difficult to find since the number of bolted routes on this section of cliff has changed since the last guidebook edition.
