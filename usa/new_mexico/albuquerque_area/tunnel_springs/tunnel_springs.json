This area provides a convenient opportunity for a half day of climbing in close proximity to Albuquerque with the opportunity for gear leads.  \n\n  The view from the crag is beautiful. You will generally see few people, mostly a few local residents walking their dogs.  \n\n  The minimum equipment for this area is a 90' gym rope, 8-10 draws, and a half rack (single set cams and nuts). Gear is generally medium to small, and sometimes tricky. \n\n  This crag is in the wilderness boundary. All bolts were hand drilled. Please observe a wilderness ethic if establishing new routes.  \n\n  There is limited opportunity to safely set top ropes (the top is loaded with rocks on a steep slope and many trees have died due to bark beetle).
