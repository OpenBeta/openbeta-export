Walk off is easiest by going up to the tower and then down the stairs.\n\n This is in such an obvious and easy to access spot that it had probably been climbed before I got on it, but I did clean off a fair bit of chossy/loose rock from the face and around the crack before figuring it out.\n\n If you use the detached block for feet on the right, it goes at abt V2- with much more straight forward beta - This is \"Softshell\"","protection":"2 or 3 crash pads.","location":"The main face on the clamshell boulder just below the tower.
