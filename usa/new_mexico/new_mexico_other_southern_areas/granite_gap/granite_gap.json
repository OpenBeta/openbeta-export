Much of the rock is dubious but several good bouldering ascents were done around the turn of the century. Surely more await. Possible route potential too. This is a primitive desert environment where it seems every plant and animal is hostile. Cactus everywhere and huge rattlesnakes. Sounds great heh?    I'm posting this area mostly for the benefit of those hearty souls who are interested in exploring for new climbing opportunities. As far as I know I am the only person to climb here. Could be wrong (Senor Murray was everywhere)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:40.956Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:04.464Z"}
