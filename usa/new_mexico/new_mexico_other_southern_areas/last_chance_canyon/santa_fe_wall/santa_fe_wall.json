Continue up utilizing some good holds in the crack to the second bolt. From here trend right on mostly jugs while negotiating some smaller crimps. A decent rest can be obtained below the roof. Head out the roof on great jugs to a heartbreaking redpoint crux just below the chains. \n\n  3 Stars for the climbing, 1 star for the rock quality.
