It has escaped publication, except for brief mention in Toula's Rock-N-Road guide, which says it was also referred to as \"Asshole Canyon\".  This area is maybe worth checking out once if you want to explore a different area near Santa Fe, but is nowhere nearly as good, tall, or extensive as similar style basalt cragging at Diablo, White Rock, or Taos Gorge. \n\n  The climbs are on a south-facing wall, so the season is spring and fall, and warmer winter days. \n\n  From right to left, the climbs are: \n\nTap Dancing on Glass (5.12) sport, 3 bolts, 2-bolt anchor \n\nUnknown Seam (~5.8) trad, 2-bolt anchor \n\nUnknown- Left Sport Climb (~5.9) sport, 3 bolts, 2-bolt anchor \n\nUnknown Corner (~5.8) trad, 2-bolt anchor   Finger crack through a roof, with a fixed sling, no anchor (I didn't try it. Looks 5.11?) \n\n  The anchors on the climbs can be reached from the top, if you don't want to lead (scramble up on either side).  You may find other even shorter cracks or TR options suitable for beginners as well. \n\n  Rock-N-Road says this is a \"locals secret area\" and gives no directions, but I can't imagine anyone cares now (let me know if otherwise). The climbs date from at least the early 90s, and there's not much potential for any quality new lines. This area will never be popular with its 30+ minute approach, short height, and small number of climbs. Especially now that Diablo has been developed so much in recent years and its approach road improved, Santa Fe climbers can so much more easily get more climbing done there. \n\n  The fossilized camel tracks have been hidden by the BLM to protect them from vandalism, supposedly."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:41.921Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:21.288Z"}
