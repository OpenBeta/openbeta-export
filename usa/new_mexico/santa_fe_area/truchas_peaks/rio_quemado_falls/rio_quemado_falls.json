For most of the year they offer a nice distraction to day hikers, backpackers and peak baggers destined for the high summits of the three Truchas Peaks.  In winter, these ~60-foot waterfalls offer some enjoyable and very isolated ice climbing routes.  \n\n  The ice is generally in from mid-December until March I'd guess. The easiest line follows a stair-stepped line up the center of the falls but harder lines with steeper ice seem likely on the left side while mixed options appear possible on the right side."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:40.478Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:48.874Z"}
