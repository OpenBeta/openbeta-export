To spot the route just look up for a bolt line heading between two distinct cracks. Once gaining the initial ledge you can step up and clip the first bolt. A few reachy, semi difficult moves will lead to some easier ones and a smooth face with cracks on either side of the bolt line. Nice route, though one you gain the face it seems to wander back and fourth across the face (contrived)! The route setters intended for the route to head up the center between cracks for the 5.10d grade. Though the cracks are so close to the bolt line, it is very tempting to reach for the large jugs that are part of the crack system. Staying between the cracks would definitely increase the grade to or beyond the 10d listed in the guides (R. Bradshaw and JM Beverly). However, you can easily clip the bolts heading up either crack system.","protection":"6 bolts to 2 bolt anchor","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Up5dbp48UnOLcp0AgWB8mw==","name":"Rooster Tail","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Vaino Kodas, 2006","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.16317,35.8191]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"105936052","mp_crag_id":"105824909","climb_id":"Up5dbp48UnOLcp0AgWB8mw==","areaRef":"Ffr0d58JXhaPPRal+EX8rQ=="},"content":{"description":"Good climb with a bulge down lown to ledgy middle and a crux bulge in a lichen patch near the top.
