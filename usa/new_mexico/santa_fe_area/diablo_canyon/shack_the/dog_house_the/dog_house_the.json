You continue hiking south past that area to a second small valley. The cliff faces east so it gets early morning sun (though not as quick as Winter Wall). In summer (the main Shack season) you probably need to be on the routes early since it gets hot. During the spring and fall seasons these are the perfect warm-ups since the usual shaded warm-ups at the Shack are often quite chilly. The rock is extremely clean basalt, similar to The Overlook and is slabby and vertical in nature. \"Old School\" slab/face climbs but very enjoyable."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:43.095Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:23.546Z"}
