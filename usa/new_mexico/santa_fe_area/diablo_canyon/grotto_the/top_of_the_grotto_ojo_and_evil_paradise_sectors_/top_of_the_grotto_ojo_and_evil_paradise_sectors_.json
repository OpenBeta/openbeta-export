Dennis Jackson asked me for a name to this route and I hadn't yet come up with one for his last Falcon guidebook, so there are citations that refer to the route as \"unnamed\".\n\n I spent a fair bit of time prying on the plate with a crowbar, and then banging on it with a 4# mallet, couldn't get most of it to go. With that said, I still wouldn't put gear in it, but pulling on it should be fine (use judgement). But you can climb through it at easier than 5.8, Id think. There is good gear above and below it. My FA attempt was originally ground-up, but I was stopped at the crux section by buckets of gravel and dirt falling into my face as I tried to use the hand crack. I came down, hiked around, and rapped in from the top. I evacuated a huge amount of debris from this upper section of crack, which turned out to be fairly larger than hand size (the #4 or 5 section), and I was ultimately happy with how well it cleaned and climbed.\n\n There is a possibility that sections of this route had been tried in the past, but if so, they certainly didn't use the same exit. They could have aided left and finished-out via a separate, left crack system. Its plausible, but again, not likely.\n\n George Perkins : \"This crack's crux is harder than it looks, making it another good one on the Diablo trad circuit. The flake is scary, but at least the climbing is easy at this point. Climb up to this flake, place pro behind. Above is a nice left-facing hand crack; then you'll reach an overhanging flared slot through a roof with a good hand crack in the back.

There are two sets of anchors - getting to the first set is the crux, and the best climbing is on this first pitch. But you can easily link both without much rope drag. \n\n  The climb begins with a few moves on jugs, bringing you up to a tricky blank section in the wall around bolt three. Resist the temptation to go right at this point (it will be difficult to get back to the bolt line if you do) and commit to a improbable traverse out the arete on the left (crux?). From here, the route stays on or near the left arete with fun and interesting moves all the way to the first set of anchors.  \n\n  The business is over but if you feel like more climbing, there is a short second pitch, more of an extension than anything.

It has stunning basalt and excellent technical climbing with exposure and views. It faces generally west with a little bit of north, so a good shady spot during morning sessions.\n\n The Ojo sector is the first crag you will pass if taking the Mordor approach trail (preferred, see topo) and boasts an impressive collection of high quality 12- sport routes as well as a couple of worthy trad lines. It faces northwest, making it pleasantly shady for a longer period of the day than other parts of this wall. This was the crag that had the first 12- in the grotto, \"Ojo\", named from the iconic satellite dish feature in the middle of the eponymous route. The staging area here is comfortable, relaxing, with phenomenal views, and there is a good density of excellent climbing from that single spot, making it a little more attractive as a destination for the day.\n\n The Evil Paradise Sector starts above the last route on the Grotto Left Wall, \"Bedeviled\" from a high nook that you could hike-scramble to if you are already climbing in the Grotto. From here, you will encounter some great classics including the moderate but wildly exposed Evil Paradise, the quality trad line \"Bloody Sunday\", and the hard testpiece \"Lucifer's Hammer Drill\" as well as some more technical face climbs like \"Black Mass\". Most of the belay stances at this sector are less than ideal, kinda scrappy, so prepare to look around a bit before you drop your packs and/or do the 3rd/4th class traverse to the base of the route. Also, if choosing this as a destination for the day, do consider approaching this sector from the Mordor trail as it will help to reduce the already accelerated erosion at the base of this wall (unfortunate, and worsening every year probably mostly due to climbers). If not, try to stick to the talus and not the erosion gullies as you hike up. Drop your packs somewhere away from the eroding mess."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":20,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:43.090Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:07.250Z"}
