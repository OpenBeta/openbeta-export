This wall has a different characteristic than the rest up the Diablo area, many of the climbs have pockets, and the crimps are more sharp and positive. The rock is less featured as well, resulting in more technical and sometimes bigger reaches between holds. \n\n  The rock, while more monolithic than the opposite side of the canyon doesn't see as much traffic.   Climb cautiously and consider helmets and belaying (and standing) out of the fall line of climbers. \n\n  The wall is West Facing so it gets morning sun and afternoon shade.  In the winter it gets less shade , and gets more shade in the summer.  In early April the wall begins to go into the shade around 3:30.  A good tool for estimating Sun / Shade beta is is the online sunearthtool.com estimator tool\n\n  The first routes are located just as you enter the Grotto.  After passing the climb \"Venarete\" there is a short break to the next set of climbs.  The next area is known as \"Winter Capacity Area\" as it gets the first sun on winter days.  After passing through a small corridor created by a large boulder you will come across the route \"Bucktooth\" another short break and the wall will curve slightly yielding the routes at the end of the Grotto area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:13:43.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:23.250Z"}
