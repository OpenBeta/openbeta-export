Bolted anchors were eventually put on this route because we were getting tired of having to jump or down climb off of the island.","protection":"Double set of Camalots from #1 to #4, some runners and quick draws, a 2 bolt anchor which might need some new sling or chains for lowering.","location":"This is the only trad route on the north side, and it is directly to the right of and shares anchors with \"Slap Happy\" which is a sport route.
