It takes a 20-30 min hike to get to the rock, but the trip is well worth the walk. You will most likely be the only climber there with a possibility of seeing a few hikers. there is a number of climbs from crack to overhangs, with all climbs being set for top belay or sling-shot belay. There are a number of solid trees for anchor points and the view over the lake is magnificent. the rock is solid with little worries of of loose rock. The climbs would most likely be from 5.7 to 5.9."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:30.471Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:35.896Z"}
