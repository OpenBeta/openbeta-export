Route starts with a wonderful undercling and works its way up with lots of good side pulls and underclings the entire way up.  The crux is near the second bolt from the top, but with some balance maneuvers is not a problem.  Finish to an easy slab.  Good hands and feet for most of the route, and a spectacular view from the top.","protection":"Bolts the whole way up to bolted anchors at the top. Anchors on top have steel biners for quickly finishing and descending the route. Standard should be to clip in and lower off instead of rapping. If going to set this as a TR put up draws to the bolts to minimize wear on the fixed gear. 6 Draws minimum required for this route.","location":"This is the farthest route from the water (Pineapple Jazz).  Start right under the first bolt. Probably possible to walk off the top, but it would be a long walk. Best to lower of the anchors up top.
