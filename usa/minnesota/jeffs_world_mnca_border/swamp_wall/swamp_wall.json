TIP: Plan yourself a few late August days here, when the bugs are down and the temps are still warm. You'll smile all day as you swim and climb and soak up the sun.   \n\n  Although all current routes have been Deep Water Soloed (except Mothman and Swamp Monster) and the water at the base has been measured in 5-6 places at around 14'-18' deep, you should remember that this is a Jack Pine Swamp, with dark water. It is difficult to impossible to see what is under the surface. Swim and climb at your own risk! \n\n  THE CLIMBING is sneaky steep and dynamic, all on great rock. It will be exciting to see further development in the next year or two. \n\n  THE RAFT and HAND LINE: In the fall of 2015 we built a Huck Finn style raft (S.W. Minnow) to access Swamp Wall routes. After realizing that rowing the raft around can be cumbersome and slow-going, a Hand Line was installed in the fall of 2016. Now you can pull yourself along the cliff at light speed. Currently, the Hand Line spans nearly the entire width of the Swamp Wall, to the base of Howlin' At The Moon (aka Waiting For Tyler), a 5.8 on the left side (as facing the wall) of Swamp Wall. Hand Line bolts have been installed the entire span of the wall, to the back of Swamp Wall (to access Mothman) and are awaiting a generous human to donate old rope, as we ran out during installation.  \n\n  The S.W. Minnow has comfortably held 6 people at once, but I would not recommend many more.  \n\n  Please show your love and respect to the S.W. Minnow and the Hand Line. Park the Minnow where you found her and report any maintenance issues to: tylerstevenhoffart@gmail.com"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:33.301Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:19.238Z"}
