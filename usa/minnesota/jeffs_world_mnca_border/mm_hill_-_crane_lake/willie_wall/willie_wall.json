Jeff suggested Willie Nelson instead, which made far more sense in the long run considering I am fan of the latter and not the former. \n\n  After a couple of days there, I discovered the locals already called the cliff M&M Hill. So, that all went out the window. This area was the first to begin development, so the idea transferred from crag to area and was named Willie Wall. The first five routes to go up all had names derived from song names by Willie Nelson.  \n\n  When I got home from that first weekend at the Hill, I felt like Charlie being given the keys to the Chocolate Factory by Willy Wonka.
