This page is retained for historical record only.\n\nIce and mixed climbing in this wild river setting provide a very accessible wilderness-like climbing environment. Up to 8 or so routes form somewhat unreliably, and variably, from year to year depending on what you call \"in.\" Routes range about 65 feet in length (+/-).\n\n The grades provided herein are a best-estimate and will only occasionally come close to the conditions you may find on any given day. Furthermore, the route Lady in Waiting (route #5) has not been climbed by myself and I needed to submit my best estimate of the most frequent conditions (mixed) and based its grade relative to mixed and dry-tool routes found in Sandstone, Casket Quarry and Orient Bay"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:30.471Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:14.332Z"}
