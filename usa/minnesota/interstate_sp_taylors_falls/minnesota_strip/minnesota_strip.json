Starts with easy climbing up to a thin seam, which can be surmounted using a horizontal hand jam below, and making a high reach to good holds. An easy deadpoint leads to a horizontal crack. The next section is the most fun - long reaches between a blank arete and a couple of sloping crimps, with the wall steadily tilting a little more overhanging as you go. This sets you up for the final six feet, and the crux, which involved some serious tomfoolery, not to mention a couple of weeks of doubt as to whether I would be able to do it. Figuring out these moves was the most rewarding part of the process of putting up this route, so I'll leave the details out, but make sure to pull a couple of techy moves out of your quiver for the crux. The last move is a nice little throw to the positive finish, and a boulder-style topout. The grade is just a guess - it isn't as painful as nearby Genetic Control, but was harder for me, and took a little longer. A fun toprope on good orange rock that doesn't feel like most of the Taylor's Falls stuff.
