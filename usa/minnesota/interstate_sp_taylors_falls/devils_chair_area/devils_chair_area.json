Start up the continuous right leaning crack. Pull a bulge then continue to top out the slab to a 6 foot ledge. Step left and build an anchor. From the anchor, lead straight up the clean face into the dihedral and under a dead tree. At the end of the dihedral, step right, then go up the steep headwall with great hand cracks. Walk left and back from the cliff to build an anchor. Be sure to give a proper \"Ka-Kaw!\" at the summit of Eagle's Nest.  \n\n  Hike up to the road, and descend the gully next to Devils Chair to get back to the base. \n\n  The two pitches can easily be linked, but forces good rope drag management practice. This climb is an awesome beginner multipitch lead with great jams for the grade. \n\n  I am sure this route has a different name, but it seems to be lost from any guidebooks.
