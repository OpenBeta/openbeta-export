Get out of the way and expect a shower of rocks from the leader as they approach the top.  \n\nRCM&W # 69, p. 130","protection":"bolts","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"qDE67I7xWQ2NB5wM0cbz1Q==","name":"Annadonia","yds":"5.11b","grades":{"yds":"5.11b","french":"6c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.52108,44.56927]},"left_right_index":18,"mp_id":"105825155","mp_crag_id":"105813076","climb_id":"qDE67I7xWQ2NB5wM0cbz1Q==","areaRef":"e8gvCvSrWoeg7g5VpE0rjw=="},"content":{"description":"A tough start into some really good powerful climbing.
