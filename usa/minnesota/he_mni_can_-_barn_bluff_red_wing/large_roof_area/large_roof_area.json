Pull the lip of the roof on the left, clip another bolt and climb to the shuts (some loose rock).  \n\n  This isn't actually a bad route, the moves are interesting and the traverse is fun. However, given the combination of rusty bolts and rotten rock above the roof, until the bolts get replaced, climbing it should be considered very risky. If you fall from above the roof and the bolt rips, you could easily deck.","protection":"bolts.  please use your own gear for toprope.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e04e29bc-d9dd-53b3-b0d7-a87a0f8ac029,629d36b1-5d4b-50f0-a42c-686dd2ba564e,c7761a2d-fcee-5369-9430-3d128c90f697","pathTokens":["USA","Minnesota","He Mni Can - Barn Bluff (Red Wing)","Large Roof Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":3,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":4,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a/b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":18,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":6,"advanced":11,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":7,"advanced":11,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.52484,44.56992]},"bbox":[-92.52547119540463,44.56947033981814,-92.52420880459535,44.57036966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105813088","area_id":"x3YaLfzuU2mUMD0SjJD2lw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-92.52547119540463,44.56947033981814],[-92.52420880459535,44.56947033981814],[-92.52420880459535,44.57036966018186],[-92.52547119540463,44.57036966018186],[-92.52547119540463,44.56947033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This area lies at the very end of \"The Dark Side\" of the bluff.
