Beware of bugs during summer in the forest.\n\nSetting Up There are two scrambles that will bring you to the top if you do not feel like leading Lumberjack Crack.South scramble: Bushwhack your way south towards the quarry. Before exiting the tree line and entering the quarry, an easy scramble takes you to the top of the rock. Pick a safe path north through some prairie / cliff tops to get back to the setup.North scramble: The quicker of the two if you don't mind a bit more climbing. Head a little north of Orc wall and keep your eye left. About 100 feet from Orc wall is a simple class 4 / 5.1-ish climb that will take you 20 feet to the top of the cliff. Pick a quick path south back to the top of Orc."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:31.874Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:16.738Z"}
