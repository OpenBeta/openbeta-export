A very beautiful and secluded area with a high concentration of quality boulders in a relatively small area. The season here is very short, usually spring is good, and the fall is even better. You can plan on good conditions most of the time in late Sept and Oct, and if your lucky, Nov. A full day spent here will leave your finger pads extremely red and sore. The rock here looks and feels like granite, but is actually called Anorthosite. Even though development began in 2000, the tick list is continually being expanded. Potential especially lies in the double digit range."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":63,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:32.878Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:18.793Z"}
