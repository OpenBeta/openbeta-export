Rock and route quality is not as good as the Picnic Rock area, but these boulders could be a great place to warm up, or bring climbers who can't climb the harder problems that the main area lends itself to. The boulders are approximately between 8 and 14 feet high, and follow a cliff band Ã  la Devils Lake bouldering.\n\n This area currently needs significant development. It may contain 20 or so lines on the easier end of the v-scale (VB-V3). A handful might be 3 star quality, but most are probably 1 or two stars. The rock is different from the main area and there is a fair amount of flakey choss in spots, but it seems like there is decent rock underneath if you are willing to do some cleaning."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:32.876Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:40.083Z"}
