None of the routes are hard enough to warrant chalk on top rope so lets help the Forest Service preserve this wonderful place for generations to come.\n\n This cliff face is granite and mostly hard rock with a few soft spots. Being in the wilderness area of the Minnesota Boundary Waters it is actually quite busy with groups passing through to see the views from the top of the cliff, often with clusters often exceeding the boundary waters limit of 9 people and 4 canoes especially during peak season. The climbs here are fun though and mostly TR (Read: bring lots of anchor line), with a few lines offering up somewhat limited and fiddly pro. Not much protection from the sun for most of the day (please don't pee on the trees that do offer some), but usually a nice breeze and good swimming."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:30.471Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:35.941Z"}
