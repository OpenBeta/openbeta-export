It is the first wall one arrives at when entering the park. Named after all the amazing volunteers who have helped in the last year to clear this area, it offers everything from steep mixed starts to longer cruisers. It also receives sun from sunrise until noon(ish).Use caution when approaching the anchor trees up top as the hillside can be icy from farming spray blowing back."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:30.475Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:36.400Z"}
