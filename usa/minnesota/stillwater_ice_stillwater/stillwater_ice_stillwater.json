The two main ice pillars, when in, would be considered great in Ourey's Ice Park. \n\n  The ice falls are formed by excess water draining from the heating system in a private property atop the cliff. With the owners permission, climbers added fixed pipes, which in a very good season, help in forming of three awesome ~150 ft icefalls/pillars. Additional mixed and drytooling routes also exist."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:32.872Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:42.649Z"}
