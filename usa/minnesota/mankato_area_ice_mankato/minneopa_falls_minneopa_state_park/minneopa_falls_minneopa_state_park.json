Climbing them is a rare event, possibly to the point you may consider notifying park rangers before doing so.  Spectators are possible due to the clear view of the falls from the railing on the sidewalk above. That said there's a good chance you will have the place to yourself on a week day in winter. Although not appropriate as a road trip destination these falls can be a fun climb if the conditions are good and you are in the area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:32.878Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:17.946Z"}
