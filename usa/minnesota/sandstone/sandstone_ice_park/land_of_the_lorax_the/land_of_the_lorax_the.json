Trails and brush were cleared to create an easier area to learn how to ice climb.\n\n The shower heads were aimed up a bit high instead of letting the water run down the first time ice was farmed. It reportedly created some amazing features on the trees and it looked like a wild imaginary land.\n\nIce has not been farmed here for the last 3 years and there are no current plans for farming."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:33.296Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:43.691Z"}
