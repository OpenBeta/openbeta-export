Highly variable ice formations form naturally here that range from grade 3 to 6 and M5-7+. Farming most often enhances this area but, unless done throughout winter, leaves most lines bashed, unstable and down-graded for the rest of winter. Two lines form around the outside corner left of Matrix (Main Flow). Several pillars formed twice here that ranged from Grade 4 to 6. Several mixed and dry-tool routes of great quality occur here and only a few are noted on this forum.
