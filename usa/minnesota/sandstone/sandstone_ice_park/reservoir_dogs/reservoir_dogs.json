From this point on to the north is what's referred to as the Reservoir Dogs Area.  Several columns formed only twice in known history here that ranged from grade 5 to 6.  What happens now is mostly dry tooling with some mixed--all exquisitly technical and sustained.  Farming produces some aerated formations that are fun until beat up."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:33.295Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:40.632Z"}
