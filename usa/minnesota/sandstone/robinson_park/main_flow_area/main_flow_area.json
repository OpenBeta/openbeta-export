I will clean it the next time I am there. \n\n  I named it Mad Dogs because the day I redpointed it my dog Pele was attacked by another dog.  Usually Pele is very submissive and just wants to have lots of friends.  I was pretty pissed at the owner of this dog and the dog at first.  Eventually the owner came over to apologize.  Apparently this puppy use to be a very social dog - until it got hit by a train and almost died.  I guess shit happens to dogs that make them hard and cold too. \n\n  There is one set of top anchors on the left of this route.
