Climbs are short and relativley straight forward with a mix of crack and face climbing on solid basalt.  There are two areas here as well as some bouldering.  Climbs on the Tunnel Bluff are about 60' and closer to 45 or 50' on the Northwest Bluff.  Duluth and the northshore area have a chalk free and bolt free ethic, though a few crags have started to sprout bolts.  DO NOT BOLT at Ely's Peak and please leave bolting at other crags to the locals as folks up here are super senstitve about ethics.  In general, DO NOT BOLT is the area.   The local schools and camps occassionally host classes at Ely's Peak so be prepared to share the crag.  Mornings are generally quiet.   All climbs are easily top-roped and a few are good trad leads.  Although there are a couple of stout routes here, the bulk of the climbing is in the sub 5.11 range with most of the classics (if such short climbs can be called such) in the 5.6 to 5.8 range.   Worthwhile climbs include Dislocation Overhang (5.6) and Bionic Finger Crack (5.12a) on the Tunnel Bluff and Corner Geometry (5.6), The Flake (5.7) and The Bulge (5.8) on the Northwestern Bluff.   Get gear at W-Trek Outfitters or Vertical Endeavors and get beer at the Brewhouse, all in Duluth.     Make sure to follow the new climbers access trail just left of the Superior Hiking Trail to access the climbing...DO NOT cut across the private property. \n\n  This area has access issues - make sure you know where to park so you do not get towed...also, the DNR is issuing tickets for trespassing so stay on the climber trail!!!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:30.474Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:36.023Z"}
