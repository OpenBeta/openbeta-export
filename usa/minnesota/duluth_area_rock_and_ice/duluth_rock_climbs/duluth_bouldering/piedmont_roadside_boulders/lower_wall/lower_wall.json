Seriously? Yes dudes. I'm telling you, this is a classic climb. Here's my reasons: 1. It has a great sit start (a lot of sds in Duluth lack the quality of actually being cool) 2. The movement flows well and is consistent throughout the climb 3. The holds are cool 4. There is an amazing pinch that I had to use (and you will likely not find a hold like this anywhere else in Duluth or Northern MN for that matter!) 5. It's a good enough length to have a little risk involved.
