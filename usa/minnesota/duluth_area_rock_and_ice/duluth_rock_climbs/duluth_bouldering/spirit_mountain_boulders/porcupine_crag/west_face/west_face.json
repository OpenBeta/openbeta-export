Beta below:Sit start matched on a ledge with a right foot flake, and the option of a far left foot ledge or a ledge under your hand start. Move out and left to a sidepull, rearrange your feet and move on the arete with your right and into an undercling with your left hand. Transfer onto the arete with both hands using tension and move out right to a crimp slot. Bump your left up, match into the arete, use an awesome ball hold, and throw out right to a dish and a good topout using an immaculate left pinch. This route has been climbed direct, and adds fun techy moves to the start and maybe half a grade. This version is definitely more \"pure\", but you should climb it however makes you happy. ","protection":"2-3 pads","location":"This route is located at the end of the cliff band.

This serves as a reminder there's lots of cool potential out here, go give it a try! This slab is a decent climb, but has a massive shelf for feet before moving into the topout, which takes some of fun out of it. The bottom has plentiful hands and feet, and the topout is a committing movement into a mantle, which is the crux. This slab can be climbed using a stand start on the left arete with a large foot chip, a stand stand direct using the pocket-y crimps, and a sit/squat start in the right vertical crack. Follow the two vertical cracks up, everything seems to be in the territory of v1. ","protection":"2-3 pads","location":"This route is located in the middle of the cliff band.
