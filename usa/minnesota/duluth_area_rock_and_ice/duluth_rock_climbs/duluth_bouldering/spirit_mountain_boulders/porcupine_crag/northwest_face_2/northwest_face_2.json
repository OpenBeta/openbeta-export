Easy start that transitions into a more powerful and technical set of beta to get yourself secure on the thin vertical crack. The crux is getting to the top out because you're high off the ground and your feet feel insecure. There are good enough hand holds and you just have to trust your feet to get over the top!","protection":"We used at least 3 pads and always had at least 1 spotter","location":"Start at the same starting holds as Bulbasaur. I start with a nice underling, a high left foot, and a smear with my right foot. Work your way left on the easy horizontal crack and then go straight up following a gnarly thin vertical crack. work your way all the way to the top while squeezing your butt cheeks because of how scary and and how insecure your feet feel going over the top for the finish. Bonus points if you yell \"help!\" towards the top because you know you'll fall haha.Â "},"__v":0},{"_id":"AxsPLnl1WQKiqUB1OmCQPw==","name":"Bulbasaur","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"Kevin Pilon","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.229,46.6856]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106770782","mp_crag_id":"106744780","climb_id":"AxsPLnl1WQKiqUB1OmCQPw==","areaRef":"RZaRpo8pW9K1ZIYI2fLAiw=="},"content":{"description":"The movement on this plus the super fun topout make it a must. I cleaned off a serious amount of crap to get to this boulder, so you should humor me by climbing it.

Spotter is helpful.","location":"The rightmost of two obvious routes on the wall that share a central sit start (sit start is bottom right of main picture). It is excellent for the grade and has some of the most improbably nice crimpers you'll find around.
