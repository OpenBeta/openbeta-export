What looks to be a nice slabby climb with a very large feature is, instead, a tough route that is bound to be a great project for people.  \n\n  A sit start on an obvious block below the groove brings you straight into the burliness of the groove. Several power moves requiring just enough technique lead you to the famous high step of the route. Keep your head on as the boulder slabs out. Holds are \"on\" around the groove, if you want to say. It makes it more pure. However, staying committed to just the groove would be much harder.","protection":"A couple of pads","location":"Front and center of The Short Block.
