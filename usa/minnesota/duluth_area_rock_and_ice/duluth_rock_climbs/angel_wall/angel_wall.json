It starts on the right-hand side, on the tufa bordering the small dihedral corner, and goes straight up the face on small slippery crimps. \n\n  I don't want to spoil the fun for the adventurous Duluth-er trying to decipher this puzzling route, but getting a very high foot on the tufa is one way to get to the better holds higher on the wall. \n\n  I have never seen a rating listed for Angel Wall, so I've given it my best guess.  Once I resolved my beta, it felt maybe like a hard 11... but the rock is very slippery and sharp and the climbing style is pretty desperate, so it could possibly be a short 5.12. \n\n  This is a really fun and unusual line for the moderate-to-hard climber and seems to have seen VERY few ascents.  The reason I am writing this description is because I've been unable to find any info on this climb.  If you know something about its history or difficulty rating, please feel free to correct me!  Otherwise, go climb it!","protection":"Three bolts at the top from which to set up a top-rope.
