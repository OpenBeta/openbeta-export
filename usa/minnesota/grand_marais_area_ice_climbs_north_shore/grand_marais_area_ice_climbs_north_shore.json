The area hosts Minnesota's best natural ice falls: Nightfall and Cascade Falls. Great warm up on the way to Nipigon in Canada. Grand Marais is home to the (almost) annual Gentlemen's Occassional - a gathering of kilted Minnesota ice climbers (see photo). The gathering mixes ritual climbing of Nightfall (in kilts) and large amounts of alcohol later on. \n\n  This is a resort town so lodging in one of the hotels or cabins is not a problem (as long as you have the cash). If you feel like eating after climbing, Sven & Ole's has great pizza's. For fun check out the Gunflint Tavern - good beer selection and live local folk music."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:08:30.471Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:14.273Z"}
