Lots of history, numerous sport routes, mixed lines, and trad to be had while parking is limited these days.\n\n The Forgotten Wall, aka Henley, is often forgotten from time to time, then rediscovered and remembered by the climbing community as the wonder filled wall of great continued potential. Lots of thanks to Norm Reed and others who developed and cleaned the area for future climbers."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:07.539Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:44.616Z"}
