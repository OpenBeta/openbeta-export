After doing all the established problems and not wanting to quite get back in the car, I played around with this traverse along the base. \n\n Sit start on the far left side and work your way rightward, staying low (below the juggy shelf/break below the overhang). This can be made harder or easier depending on which holds you decide are \"on\" or not. In general I found the rock to be a bit more solid than the topouts on all the other established problems and so ended up doing it several times (including right to left) before we moved on. Top out on the right side, either via D'Horn or D1.","protection":"","location":"This boulder sits close to Lake of the Woods behind the back entrance to the Zoo.
