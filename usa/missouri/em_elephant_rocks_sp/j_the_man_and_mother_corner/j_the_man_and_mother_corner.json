Next, get psyched. Work up the man cut perfect finger flake from the ground to a chiseled ledge between the head wall and overhanging boulder. Traverse left to the roof boulder's crack using natural jibs or the drilled holes for feet. Work into the crack with a heel/feet on the ledge. Power up, through, and over the crack's thin holds and jams for a high ball top out on questionable blocks. Sustained line with a broad mix of technique and gumption.","protection":"Def want several pads and spotter. Could be better but landing is about as flat and solid as you could hope for with a quarried route like this.
