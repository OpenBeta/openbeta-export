Access can be made legally on foot (consult your GIS map) and is obviously quite easy by boat. The band of stone itself is about a tenth of a mile long with varying height and rock quality (think of the Warsaw crag, but before decades worth of choss was cleaned up).Two lines were put up in 2015 and beyond that I have no knowledge of any other activity. There is potential for many, many more routes though the quality of which is yet to be determined."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:07.918Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:21.022Z"}
