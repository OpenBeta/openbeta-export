We probably have close to 40-50 boulder routes that need to be cleaned and established and we need your help!Feel free to match up your FA with the pictures posted. The pictures go from left to right.  MP may not let me organize them the way I want but BG 1 is the furthest left route waiting to be established, BG 2 is just to the right of that and so on...After you have established a new route please send us a picture of the route, what BG # picture below does it match up with,  a description, is it top out or drop off, your rating, who got the FA and what you'd like to name it.
