Currently, this is the 2nd developed section of bolted lines you arrive at when approaching from the Boulder Ridge Trail, at the north end of the bluff line.Routes are roughly 25 - 65 ft tall and provide a wide range of route difficulty from easy to more difficult levels (range from 5.5 to 5.13). Time to warm-up? Start with the 5.easy climbs located on the lower right end of the wall. The harder lines do require dry season weather for the best climbing conditions.Ratings: While easier climbs are given a rating number representing the climb to be no harder than the rating represented, routes rated 5.10 and up are given a specific max crux rating. This should help you plan your visit and navigate your way along the bluff while using Mountain Project.Please provide feedback using your MP App. Star rating and rate difficulty feedback helps the next visitors use the app."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:09.224Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:44.535Z"}
