This is known as the 3 Hour Tour Buttress.

This route becomes a water fall during a brief heavy rain. A bit further left, The Beer Ledge boulders are a tall stack at the base of the wall that redirects the walking trail down and around. The large stack also is used to gain the first bolts on Beer Ledge (5.9) and Tennessee Whisky (5.11).\n\nRoutes range from 35 ft to 100 ft tall and currently provide a wide range of difficulty levels (range from 5.6 to 5.11).
