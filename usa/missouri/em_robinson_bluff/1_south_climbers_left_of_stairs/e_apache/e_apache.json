Jugs take you past the big flakes at the bottom and the first 4 bolts. Then the face turns a bit more vertical and balance is more important. holds decrease in size and the small pockets become important. It was a bit muddy during my last climb which made the climb feel harder like a 5.9 or so. (Still a new climb as of Jan 2020) The crux moves are just below the anchors. The last clip is fairly close to rap anchors so you are well protected for the move.
