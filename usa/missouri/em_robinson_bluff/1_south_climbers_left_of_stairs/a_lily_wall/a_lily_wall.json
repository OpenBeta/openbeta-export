The Lilly Wall is also known as the Beehive Wall because the Beehive route was one of the first lines bolted on the face and remains popular due to it's 5.9 rating. The wall section starts, at the base of the main approach stairs, with a cave entrance and a few overhanging routes. At the base of the main wall, three main routes provide a range of features. Beehive starts on the lower right slab and then offers large pockets on the upper, slightly less then vertical face. \n\nRoutes\n\nrange from 45 ft to 120 ft tall and provide a range of moderates to more difficult levels (range from 5.9 to 5.11). A Multi-pitch option offers a 120 ft two pitch climb up the center of the wall (see B Garden). A couple different link up of routes on the main cave overhang, provides a few more challenge options. Start standing or choose a sit start to make the roue harder! Perma-draws are also provided through the crux sections of several of the routes on this wall. Enjoy your workout!\n\nRatings:\n\nWhile easier climbs are given a rating number representing the climb to be no harder than the rating represented, routes rated 5.10 and up are given a specific max crux rating.
