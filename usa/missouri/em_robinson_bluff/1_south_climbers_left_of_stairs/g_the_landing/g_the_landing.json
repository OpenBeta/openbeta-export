Unlike the other routes, the crux here is near the top. The route has some good holds which are small. So if your hands are tiny you might like it - unless, of course , you are over 70 years old and weigh over 240. In that case, better stick to golf and tweeting.There is an interesting variation to this route worth trying on top rope (using the Tiny Hands anchor). Just left of the start up the first three bolts is a dihedral which is quite challenging.
