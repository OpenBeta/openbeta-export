Fairly easy climbing at the bottom with decent pockets through the grey horizontal stripe in the face just below the cave. Make a few reachy moves to pull into the cave. Come left out of the cave onto the face. This is the crux, climb up and around the slight roof on some thin moves and then straight up to the large overhang above.\n\n Be careful on top rope, the roof will cause you to swing out into the trees at the bottom and when you lower down you'll be lowering through the trees as well. Possible variations to the left and right look like they can get around the imposing roof at the top, but have not been explored yet.","protection":"Several trees at top large enough to set up a TR anchor. Bring enough webbing or cord as the trees are atleast 10' from the edge.\n\n Rock is not clean, anticipate pulling or kicking off multiple rocks up to the size of a golf ball as you climb. Holds may fall off when you grab them but none of the larger pieces felt insecure.","location":"Take the normal switchback approach up to the face, turn right and walk for about 7 minutes. The route is approximately 150 meters from the right end of the cliff face where you can walk around to the top. Large section of tall light orange-colored limestone wall. Look for the very large elliptical pocket that looks like it's large enough for a person to climb into with a cave right below it. The climb starts right below this."},"__v":0},{"_id":"dlMK7t5DV9GC9mhfztZTQg==","name":"Laminar Flow","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Daniel Quick","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.05685,37.84665]},"left_right_index":13,"mp_id":"117961767","mp_crag_id":"118193507","climb_id":"dlMK7t5DV9GC9mhfztZTQg==","areaRef":"3ElXs5giVVi6T896XQIFnA=="},"content":{"description":"Nice short moderate with good clipping stances.","protection":"6 bolts + bolt anchor.","location":"Walk about 100 feet climber's right of water moccasin.
