This busy park is host to a campground, picnic areas, ball courts and boat access with good fishing. This is a great crag for those sweltering mid to late summer days.  Not so great any other time as Bull Shoals Lake can get quite chilly and the climbing is shaded after noon .   \n\n  The bluff itself faces east and the main section is slightly overhanging and is comprised of good limestone above the water line.  The water is sufficiently deep most of the time but can sometime get a little low in a few areas. Stay safe! Do some swims to get a gauge on the depth and underwater structure. There are only three named routes that I know of but I've seen nearly every inch of climbable space on that wall occupied by a human. Bring a 2+ person water vessel of your choosing. \n\n  Pics to come!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:07.918Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:21.653Z"}
