So named because it diverts away from the much harder line that crosses the face to the right. There may be a pretty hard sit start, which would also be the start for the harder version. The risk factor comes from a not-great fall zone, with a tree getting in the way of good pad placement. Probably on the hard end of V1, and fairly reachy, though there's likely beta that counteracts that.","protection":"Pad, maybe a spotter.","location":"Look for the prominent downhill face.
