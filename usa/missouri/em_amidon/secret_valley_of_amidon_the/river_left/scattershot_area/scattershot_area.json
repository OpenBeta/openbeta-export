The hardest moves come down low. PG13 is for the combination of height and condition: the problem is currently in a fairly uncleaned state, with moss, lichen, and some crumbly rock, although the rock up higher seems fairly stable. Holds could definitely pop, though, and I won't rule out larger blocks coming down too. Over time it should clean up alright.

The name of the area refers to the dispersed nature of these problems. Okay-sized boulders dot the hill, all easily visible when the brush drops its leaves. As you move further downriver, the density increases somewhat, with a small cluster of lines and a pseudo-cliff. Rock quality varies, but should improve with some traffic. There are some pretty proud lines to be had in this area, and plenty of less-proud-but-still-probably-fun ones. Be warned, though: getting here isn't trivial, especially in higher water, and the whole area is pretty well covered in brush (with not a few thorns!).
