Now the land is privately owned and the community regularly run-off youth to keep anyone from getting injured. The cliffs on the south end of the bluff are also privately owned but the closure conditions remain the same. We have specifically spoken to the land owners and they do not want people on their property without permission and wish to not have the foot traffic.
