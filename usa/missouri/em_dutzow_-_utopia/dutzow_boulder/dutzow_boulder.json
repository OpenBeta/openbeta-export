It has been visited and re-visited through time by climbers walking the tracks and then biking down the trail. Names were never given to the random ascents, that I know of through the years, but the trail side boulder and sandstone exposure still remains a great stopping point for those traveling the Katy Trail by bike or foot. Currently, a handful of routes are listed for this boulder with a good range of difficulty, from moderately easy to quite difficult.\n\n     This boulder has three main sides: the steep west face, the slab east face, and the back walk off. The historical ascents that I know of include the South Arete, The East Slab, and the West Side Variations. If you need some warm-up lines, head back to the Devil's Den main wall for easier traditional lines."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":11,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:10.176Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:24.920Z"}
