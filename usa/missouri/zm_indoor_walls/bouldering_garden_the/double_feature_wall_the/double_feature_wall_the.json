This leads to the roof and a couple stalactites. Another crack sits divides the main slightly overhanging face. This off-width is never an easy solution. The roof section connects to a pillar which connects to another roof system, providing a 60 ft line of overhanging climbing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:07.914Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:21.061Z"}
