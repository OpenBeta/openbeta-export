The Box Wall forces the classic overhang to vertical face technique that is difficult to master without a blend of great foot work, heel hooks, high steps, and raw power. Year around layback cracks provide great starts for the box feature."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:07.915Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:42.523Z"}
