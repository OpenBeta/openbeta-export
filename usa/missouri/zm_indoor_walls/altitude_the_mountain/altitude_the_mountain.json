The Mountain is home the manufacturing of the large climbing holds and volumes, known as Altitude Rocks. If you are interested in learning more about the facility, wanting to learn how to climb, or currently climb and wish to be involved, feel free to drop us a line. We are currently hiring for a number of positions and also welcome volunteers for our support the community program. \n\n  Altitude does rock and we are proud to be offering Columbia a location to facilitate the growing interest, in the sport of climbing. Climbing is now a part of the Olympics so with a bit of interest and effort, the Show Me State Games can also have a climbing competition division."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:09:07.547Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:42.161Z"}
