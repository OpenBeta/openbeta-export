Get a strange scrunched up left foot on a small edge out left. Keeping the foot, contort your body so that you can grab a decent right-hand flake jug at the end of the edge. Once you get that, continue to keep the left foot on and fall into a small ear crimp to the left of the flake jug with your left hand. From there, swing and grab the lip. Switch feet and bump your left hand up higher to a good edge (you will need to tick it so that you can find it). Switch hands on the good edge, stab out left to a sidepull, and then heel hook a huge edge on the left corner of Second Base. From there, throw up to a tips crack just below the second small roof. Lean out and grab small crimps over the small roof. Match, then go up to a good juggy crack and top out on decent but dirty holds.There is a deeper start starting on two horrible nothing-crimps with next to no feet.
