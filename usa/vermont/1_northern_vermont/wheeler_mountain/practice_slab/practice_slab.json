No official route names as far as I know and mostly a solo climb, but there are some bolts placed in a few spots here. At least 1 double-bolt anchor roughly 80ft off the ground that could be used as TR anchor, and a series of bolts that traverse to the anchor from the side (I just solo'd it per local recommendation). All open slab from there to the top w/ minimal pro but it eases up into 3rd/4th class slab.**NOTE: The two bolt anchor on the left side should not be used until it can be replaced. The corrosion caused by a steel bolt and aluminum hanger have made it unsafe. The same is true of the bolts leading out the anchor from higher up on the left side.
