Â Follow the right leaning crack system to some slingable trees and an arete with positive holds. After climbing the arete, step up and left to a dirty ledge and follow another short crack to another slingable tree. Run it out for about 20ish feet on superb friction to a couple of cracks. Follow up and left to the next crack system, which features yet more bomber holds and gear placements. Follow the crack up and around to a tree anchor on the right.This route makes an excellent first lead.Descent: Double rope rap or single 60 m rope rap into the gully on climber's right and walk down. A single 70 will reach the ground.","protection":"Excellent protection with a variety of placements.
