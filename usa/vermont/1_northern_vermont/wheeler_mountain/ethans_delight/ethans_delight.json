Clip a bolt and continue up easier slab, passing small gear in the vertical cracks on your left.  Climb to a tree ledge directly above with gear under a small overlap.  Clip a bolt on the next face above the tree ledge and either climb the face to a two-bolt anchor or step left for a slightly easier romp up the arete to the anchor.  There is a bolt half way up this face that can be used to protect either variation.This anchor is well placed for top rope laps with a 60 m rope.Note: With crux moves off the ground, a stick clip could come in handy for the first bolt.*FA party intends to continue the adventure upwards from this anchor and will post an update when applicable.","protection":"3 bolts and small gear.  There's a bomber placement for a 00.  Good placement for an offset #3 if you have it, but not really necessary.","location":"About 20 minutes past the great corner along the approach trail.  If you reach Ethan's Delight, you've gone about 100' too far."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f0144402-e84e-5e32-88ee-648033ed0e77,c39deb6c-8546-520a-9c31-aee4f0c33a5c,5e6d420b-06ba-5811-a85e-73c6e4298f3c,307cdd87-25b4-5bd8-bcca-012dcd115c99","pathTokens":["USA","Vermont","1.
