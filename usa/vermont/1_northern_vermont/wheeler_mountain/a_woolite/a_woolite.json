Climb the slab up to an arete. Follow this arete to a bolt. Continue past the bolt straight up to a tree ledge. There is a two bolt anchor just above the tree ledge.  \n\n  Pitch 2- From the two bolt anchor move left to flakes. Climb the flakes up and through the large break in trees ultimately staying right towards a diagonal crack and more flake. There are a couple tough slab moves to get to the crack section. Finish by pulling up and over the final bulge on a hallow flake to a two bolt anchor.   \n\n  You can rap back down to the first pitch here but then getting to the ground with one rope 60 or 70 meters is no possible. So bring two ropes if you would like to rappel. \n\n  You can also walk off to the hiking trail if you would like.","protection":"Bolts and standard rack","location":"On the left side of the first slab you come to from the Moosehead area.
