Hot Seat in Hell will knock your socks off. A bit hard to find though.","protection":"Mostly finger size pieces","location":"To get to The Eagle Point area: follow the climbers trail past the great corner area for about 20 minutes, passing many trailside crags along the way. Best thing is to buy a copy of Tough Schist, the vt climbing guidebook. \n\n When you reach the route \"Ethan's Delight\" , climb that.  It has a single bolt protecting the low crux. You need at least a 70 meter rope to rap this route.  Tie knots to be sure. At the top of Ethan's Delight, follow a faint trail for a couple minutes up through the woods to eagle point left. Its a nice gesture to bring a bag and bring out some trash that hikers throw there from the lookout above! Doing so will enable  you to achieve the karmic balance needed for Hot Seat in Hell."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f0144402-e84e-5e32-88ee-648033ed0e77,c39deb6c-8546-520a-9c31-aee4f0c33a5c,5e6d420b-06ba-5811-a85e-73c6e4298f3c,0235cd2e-26b5-54d7-9d49-029fba3e8497","pathTokens":["USA","Vermont","1.
