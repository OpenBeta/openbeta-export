Throw to the hanging flake...\" Both of these holds are more like crimp sidepulls and fairly obvious. It all seems simple enough- grab the starting holds, pull off the ground and either throw for the flake or use a hard to hit intermediate (gaston or sidepull, depending on your beta) with your right hand. Once you've secured the flake, heroically lay it back to the top. However, the starting holds aren't very good (maybe even broken?) and it all seems quite hard for the grade.","protection":"A couple crash pads would be nice.
