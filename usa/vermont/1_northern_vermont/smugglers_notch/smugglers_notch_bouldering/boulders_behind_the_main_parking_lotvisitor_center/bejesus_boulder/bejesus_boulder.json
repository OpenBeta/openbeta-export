Sit start in the corner of the overhang to the right of Brother John. The right hand is on a large jug feature and left hand is down and left on a large incut crimp. Pull-on and make a big lock-off out left before figuring out a delicate and technical sequence up the slopey dihedral. Find a good spot in the dihedral and make a crux lockoff over the bulge to a good hold. Â From here, a few more long reaches between large holds gains easier slabby terrain and an easy topout.","protection":"2 regular pads, and a blubber pad. The fall is fairly safe, even though the slab is pretty steep.","location":"This climb starts about 8 feet right of Brother John.
