The sit start is hard enough to be interesting. After gaining the obvious jug hold on the arete you can either mantle and step up and right or continue up the arete. The step up and right continues to the top on lower angle but balancy VERY high moves. This is the only line I've topped out. The proud line follows the arete all the way to the top - which can be top roped (hard - 5.12?) but can't be exited due to massive vegetation.","protection":"pad at the bottom and then gravitron to avoid falling from the higher slab.","location":"bat cave boulder to the right of penumbra"},"__v":0},{"_id":"5G101vJvWB2UfZB36jeUdg==","name":"Penumbra","yds":"V9-10","grades":{"yds":"V9-10","font":"7C+","vscale":"V9-10"},"fa":"Jake List or Brian Bittner","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.79451,44.55696]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"109503511","mp_crag_id":"109500619","climb_id":"5G101vJvWB2UfZB36jeUdg==","areaRef":"eK6kiE4ZU1y6lkDC9Icr9A=="},"content":{"description":"This tall problem starts on a vertical skinny hold and moves up into sidepull crimps. There are 3 options for sidepulls and use these to get to a slot in a crack. From the slot climb straight up to a heady top out. I think its okay to use the roots at the top to finish since there's no exposed rock on top. Be careful because they are loose. \n\n  WARNING: be mindful of your fingers in the slot. If you take a fall you have to consciously pull them out as you're falling or else they will get stuck.","protection":"LOTS of pads.

V2 this is not unless there is something I'm majorly overlooking, or if you use the cheater block next to the start. I'm tossed up on what to give it for a grade so take it with a grain of salt. This is my best guess based on a few similarly graded routes I've done in the notch, combined with the little info I've been able to dig up. If you have better info like Name, grade, FA let me know.
