Follow the crack to the jugs at the left end of the boulder, try your best not to lean against the adjacent boulder as you bump up to the juggy lip.Alternate Finish: Do the first several moves and then once you've moved your heel onto the face and your left hand is in the good slot stand up on your foot and reach up to several crimps.
