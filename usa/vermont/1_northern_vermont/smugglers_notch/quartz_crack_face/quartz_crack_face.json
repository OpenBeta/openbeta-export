With intimidating exposure and mostly good gear, this route is a fun one for any aid climber.\n\n With 300 feet of air beneath you, this route is intimidating and exposed. It's nearly as difficult and scary for the follower as it is the leader, so beware of that bringing up people that are new to aid. \n\nBeta:\n\nFollow the beginning of Pitch 4 of Quartz Crack up to the corner and begin traversing right beneath the roof. It may be beneficial to belay from somewhere in here due to the immense amount of rope drag generated on the roof, especially after pulling the roof, but I'm not sure if you'd be able to find enough pieces.\n\n Right after where the crack flares to the left there's a set of 3 old pins, directly above that and out about 2.5 feet is the first piece in the seam of the roof that you'll aid. Follow that out, free and aid over the lip, and build a gear anchor on the roof.\n\nDescent: Head directly through the bushes at the top of the climb, bushwacking about 15 feet to a climbers trail. You could also traverse around to the left, but that is a bit more difficult and has much higher consequences in the case of slipping (a 300 fall off a face). Follow the ski trail climbers left and down as you do the standard Quartz Crack Descent.\n\nGear: Make sure both the leader and follower have etriers or aiders, daisies, and a fifi. It might also be helpful for the follower to have some means of ascending if they fall. ","protection":"Standard rack to half an inch, with larger supplemental pieces for the free section to the roof.

You'll also be the star of the show all day as tourists gawk up at you from the parking lot.\n\n P1 (5.5, ~60'): Go straight up, past 2 bolts to a nice ledge with a new two bolt rap anchor. It's possible (and I recommend) combining this pitch with the next one.\n\n P2 (5.7, 70'): Move left from the anchor and up an easy corner trending back right almost immediately. Near the end of the pitch, continue up steeper terrain past an old pin or two to another nice ledge and a bolted rap anchor.\n\n P3 (5.8, 95'; 5.6R): Move left off the belay again to the obvious crack. Some tricky pro and 3 ancient pins to get started. You'll pass some white quartz through this section that gives the route its name. After 40', run it out over easier terrain to a right facing corner above and a little left (pretty obvious). There are currently some really old, terrible cord slung around a block in this corner. Don't use it. Continue up to a new two-bolt rap anchor just above, under the roof.\n\n P4 (5.9, 100'): Don't skip this pitch. It's the money in my opinion. Traverse low and right until under a corner system and a terrible bolt that can be backed up with a very small cam. Move up from here, passing more ancient relics (and gear options that you should use) through the crux corner. Expect this to either be wet or mossy. Go all the way up this corner to under a roof. Don't traverse right too early. See               \n\nP4, traversing too early.  Don't go this way!  You're supposed to be up about 15 ft. higher into the corner above where this climber is, directly under the massive roof above.       for what not to do! Once under the roof, move right to a good ledge and gear/tree anchor.\n\n P4 Aid Variation / Quartz Crack Roof (5.9 C2, 90'): Probably the best aid climb in all of Vermont, this variation follows a thin seam in the roof that the traditional fourth pitch traverses underneath. Begin the same as P4, climbing up into the corner under the roof and traversing climber's right with hands just below the roof. When you reach a thin seam in the roof, marked by a crack that is flared left and a few pitons that may have been the belay for this pitch, begin directly back onto the roof. Follow that seam through to some smaller cam and possibly nut placements, clipping an old piton and button head, as well as a brand new bolt along the way. Use a combination of aid and free moves to come over the roof, set a gear anchor, and then bushwack straight back about 10 - 15 feet for a climbers trail for the rappel.\n\n The aid pitch is incredibly exposed with about 300 feet of air directly beneath you, and is an incredible experience for anyone who aids (or just wants to do this awesome route).\n\n Interesting to note that the P3 belay and entire climb of this pitch is totally protected from any time of rain the notch can throw at you, which can be a fun experience.\n\n Descent: You can rap from any of the first 3 pitches easily. Once you top out, you'll have to hike climber's right on the Beduin Trail a bit to another rap route. It's a pretty obvious trail that may be marked with orange or pink tape. Find a trail skiers right which leads to a nice ledge with two anchors on it. The one closest to the edge will have rap rings. A single 60m rope will take you to the top of the first pitch of Flight of the Manatee and a second rap gets you to the ground a few hundred feet climber's right of the base of Quartz Crack. Additionally, if you have a tagline or climbed as a group of three, a single-strand rappel with a 60m will get you from the top rappel station to the ground in one rappel. It is a true rope stretcher so tie your knots. Lighter climbers may find themselves tiptoeing the ground, so have the heaviest climber go first to help.","protection":"Standard trad rack should get this done based on your mileage at the grade.

The main parking lot in the notch offers a great view of this impressive section of rock.  It's big, steep, and has huge roofs near the top. \n\n  Most of the routes (including the namesake Quartz Crack 5.9) on this wall come in at the sub 5.10 level, but shouldn't be underestimated.  The protection is generally pretty good, but there can be mandatory run-outs on easier ground. \n\n  The wall faces southeast and gets sun from the morning through the greater part of the day.  Storms can roll in even on a bluebird day in the notch. \n\n  Most of the popular routes on the wall will have new bolted rappel options to bail.  However, once you top out on the cliff, you'll have to hike off [climber's right] a ways to find the rappel."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":11,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:15.899Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:25.429Z"}
