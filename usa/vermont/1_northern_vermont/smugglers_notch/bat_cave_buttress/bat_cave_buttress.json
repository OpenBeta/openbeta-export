Continue up wonderfully steep and exposed terrain for the grade until you reach the massive party ledge. Walk a few feet right under the overhang and belay off of a two bolt anchor. 5.7+ Pitch 2: Step right, clip a high bolt and pull one or two crux moves, following jugs to a slopey mantle. Then, climb straight up the low fifth class arete, clipping bolts until you reach the ring bolt anchor at the top. You'll wish this part went on for another 100 feet. 5.9 ","protection":"10 draws should do it. Ring bolts at the top, a 70 meter rope brings you to the ground in one rappel, a 60 meter will require 15-20 feet of 4th class down climbing. There are no rings on the bolted anchor atop pitch 1, however it is possible to make an exposed scramble on climbers left to descend from here if needed.","location":"Starts on the bolted slab that touches down right to the herd path.
