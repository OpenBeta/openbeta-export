Thus, the name: Carcass Crag. Carcass has only a handful of routes, but features good quality stone, and a much shorter hike than the 82 crag. With several 5.12s and 5.11s, Carcass is sure to be one stop shopping for anyone who would rather not hike too far, but who isn't willing to compromise on quality.
