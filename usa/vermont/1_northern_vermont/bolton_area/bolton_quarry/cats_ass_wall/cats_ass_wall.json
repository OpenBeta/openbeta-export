Initial boulder problem is about V5 then leads to an awkward stance, hard clip and another V4 boulder problem to the large undercling. From there it's only about 5.10+ to the anchor. VERY thin and cruxy. The grade on this route has been debated. Officially the grade is 12a but repeat ascentionists have suggested it is somewhat harder (likely 12b or so). I've given it the grade of 12a/b in light of this.","protection":"bolts","location":"Far right side of the Cat's Ass Wall"},"__v":0},{"_id":"kWRzMC8WVg+ZYJtiOJ21+Q==","name":"It's only Interment","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"Travis Peckham","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.8691,44.3747]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106731504","mp_crag_id":"110531084","climb_id":"kWRzMC8WVg+ZYJtiOJ21+Q==","areaRef":"43crCT3ZWdetRR9F41SAew=="},"content":{"description":"Right arching crack on the left hand side of the Cat's Ass wall.
