The base area and clifftop are more manageable, thus descending routes/setting up TRs is possible without breaking too much of a sweat.  A few of the classic routes are  Dawson's Corner (5.7) and  Gemini Dream (5.8). \n\n  Many of the routes follow obvious crack systems and corners though there are a few face routes, and one spectacular unfinished project (has been TR'd, but awaits a redpoint ascent) called \"Chainsaw Reaction\" that tackles a razor-sharp overhanging arÃªte.  Care must be taken on the summit of this cliff to avoid additional erosion.
