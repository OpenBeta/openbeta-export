This is the home of thin, often undecipherable face climbing in the 5.10 to 5.12 range.  It also includes one of the better 5.8 trad routes in Bolton, Cyclops.  A great alternative for crowded days at the Dome with a good variety of routes from 5.7 to 5.12.  Terra Incognita stays fairly dry and routes on the main wall can be top roped with relative ease.
