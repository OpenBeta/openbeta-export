Climb straight off the ledge up the face as the crimps continue and the angle gets steeper. Clip a bolt at the lip before an airy mantel into the alcove (crux). Catch your breath and enjoy the setting before one last exposed traverse move up and left onto the headwall to a comfy belay ledge. 10 bolts to a ring bolt anchor. 100 feet\n\n **There is a death block clearly marked with an “X” to the right of the fourth bolt. It is outside the path of travel, but be careful not to pull on it or it will be a very bad day for your belayer. I need to clear the base of the Dome and go trundle it when the coast is clear.\n\n Descent - with a 60m rope you can descend in 3 rappels using the Aye for an Aye/Redbeard’s Treasure anchor. With a 70m rope you can BARELY get to the base with some easy down climbing.
