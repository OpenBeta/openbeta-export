As far as I know nothing has been climbed on this boulder in years (or at all?). It looks like there is a few easy lines that would serve as great warmups for the harder climbs in the area. Height/landing is a factor to consider here.\n\n If you decide to try to establish some climbs on here please take care to make sure the higher up holds are safe to use and that your landing is safe."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:18.609Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:47.303Z"}
