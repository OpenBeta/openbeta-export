If the feet were better it would be V0. Top out to the right as you would for Smack Dat. Or just mantle off the jugs and top out at 5 ft high if you want.

There is a lot of moss and ferns up there and I haven't cleaned it out and climbed past the lip. V3 is an estimate of the grade based on the first couple moves from the prow up the the lip, but unless someone finds a topout jug under the moss the topout mantle could be fairly hard.
