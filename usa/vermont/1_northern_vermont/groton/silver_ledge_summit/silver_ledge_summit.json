Aretes, jugs, knobs, handles, flakes. Easy holds but bold angles for big throws and hero moves, some overhangs with plenty to grab on to, pumpy traverses. Sit start options in a few spots. Plenty of V0-3 options, harder lines possible. Super safe landings and angled walk offs.Shaded, so any time of day works. Clean *enough*, no major scrubbing required to cruise on the easier stuff, although there is plenty of vegetation and a few select spots could use a polish. Worth the approach.Â "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:14.674Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:23.316Z"}
