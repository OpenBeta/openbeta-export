This cliff is fairly off the beaten path and because of that you will almost definitely be the only group there. \n\n  Routes here range from 5.6 to 5.10 and are mostly sport with bolted anchors at the top.  There are a few trad routes here as well. \n\n  The approach is fairly long.  I would plan on around an hour give or take a bit. Despite the long hike you can get on just about all of the routes here in a day. \n\n  I have heard that many routes stay wet for a bit after rain so be sure to keep an eye on the forecast before heading out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:16.306Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:44.438Z"}
