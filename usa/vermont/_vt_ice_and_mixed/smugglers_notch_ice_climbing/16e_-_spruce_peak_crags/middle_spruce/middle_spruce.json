This area has a range of flows that go from WI2-4 and range in height from 20-60+ ft.  The central area has a few beautiful curtains and pillars.  The right side is shorter, but a good practice area.  The left has a wide variety.  It gets afternoon sun and probably isn't fully in until late December/early January. \n\n  On either end, you can trudge up to the top to rig TRs but be cautious of the quality of the trees up there."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:13.121Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:50.106Z"}
