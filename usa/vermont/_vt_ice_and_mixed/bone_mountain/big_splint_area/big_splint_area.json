This is as remote as it gets in Bolton and is among the most secluded ice climbing in Vermont. Use appropriate caution.\n\n These climbs were discovered by Adam Gelman, Kris Fiore, and Will Bondurant in the winter of 2020. Upon discovery they dispatched two of the three obvious flows. An attempt of the third resulted in a broken ankle and a long bloody ski descent, inspiring the ominous route names of the area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:14.215Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:42.100Z"}
