Once out of the hole, utilize crimps to move up to a half-circle shaped group of edges. Get a high right foot and reach as far as you can up and right to a bad crimp. From there, get another high right foot and move your left hand into a crack-pocket. Dyno to a right-hand edge up and right, then slap the top.\n\n IMPORTANT: You should feel confident before trying this, there is a very real danger of falling into the hole (the cruxes are directly above it).
