A bit of a one move wonder, as surmounting the small roof is really the only section of the climb at the grade.  But also one of the few protectable lead climbs in the area. There is  an air conditioner sized loose block about halfway up (at the top of the jagged crack above the roof). Despite easily rocking back and forth it is pretty wedged in. Try as I might I could not trundle it without a bar.
