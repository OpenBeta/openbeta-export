Rock climbing has never been popular here but has been quietly taking place for over 50 years now. The main section of the cliff is comprised of sections with distinctly different characteristics. The first area to the left of the approach trail is mostly vertical with some slabs and small roofs. Where the approach trail meets the cliff are the two most impressive features, two massive left facing corners where the left wall is slaby and the right wall is steeply overhung. Beyond these two corners the wall tends to be more vertical and comprised of small aretes and roofs. Beyond that section the wall turns entirely slab and offers some outstanding beginner climbing for all to hone their skills and test their nerves. At the end of the main slab section the trail leads to the top of the cliff or continues (less traveled) to the PHAR End walls."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:17.497Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:55.477Z"}
