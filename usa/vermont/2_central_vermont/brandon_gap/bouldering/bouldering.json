Bust a couple thin moves with tough feet to a final cruxy stab to where the crack opens up. Probably easier if you are taller. Finish easily. Actually pretty sweet.\n\n I'm sure this thing has been climbed before because the line is so obvious and close to the road; if anyone has FA info, the real name, or a grade let me know and i can update the page. Also, curious if people have more info on the blocs further up the hill!","protection":"At least one large pad, two or more ideal.
