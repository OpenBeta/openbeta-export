The rock is a mix of quartz, mica schist and sandstone boulders and rocks. It's about 15 long and 10-15 ft high. It is right off of the W&OD bike path and a hiking path so you will probably hear people on the bike path and see people walking their dogs on the hiking path. The rock is pretty solid, some moss that could be cleaned up and some parts were a bit crumbly but that wasn't really an issue.  I'm not sure if anyone has bouldered here before (I wouldn't be surprised if some one has) but I climbed 4 fairly distinct problems, all in the V0-1 range (I think this range, I'm not much of a boulderer. They were easy but not complete give-me's).  I did these alone without a spotter or crash pad but I would recommend both. Mostly crimpy holds, decent feet and nice finishing jugs to top out on. \"Urban bouldering.\"  My friends and I used to hang out here in high school and someone said that there was an ambush on a train here during the civil war so we called it the civil war bridge but I have no idea if that is actually true."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:58.156Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:09.975Z"}
