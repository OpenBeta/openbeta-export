Start with both feet on a low ledge with a nice area to move feet around. Left hand goes to a crimp high and to the left. Right hand holds a low edge. Left foot goes high to press toe into a 1 inch wide/6 inch long edge that runs at 45 degree angle. Right hand goes up high for a sloper on the top (not really any obvious good holds here). Left hand turns into press/pushup position and pressing on this and the right foothold move up until you can bring your left foot over the roof. From here its pretty easy to walk the rest of the way to the top.\n\n Crux is the high right foot placement. I'm not very flexible and had to warm-up the hips to reach it. Once that foot is placed its not too hard but the next press to get over the roof requires some commitment.","protection":"There's water and sloped/slippery rock at the base of this climb. Overall its not a great landing. The rock is big enough to hold a pad but about half of the pad won't have a solid base. Stepping onto the first ledge isn't too risky and I kinda felt my way around for a while before I committed to the big step up move.","location":"Located in the middle of the cascade of rocks that leads to the shore area.
