This area contains a 300ft long stone masonry retaining wall located along Four Mile Run Park with countless potential elimination traverse problems. \n\n  Rock type varies at each piece of the wall, but much of it is believe to be schist, quartz, and slate. No gear or crash pad is needed since all routes are traverses that do not exceed body heights. There is frequent travel from joggers and bikers commuting along this trail so please do you part to keep your gear contained and tidy to ensure that access to this area will continue to remain open to future climbers. \n\n  The park is owned by Arlington County and is closed after sundown."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:53.716Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:29.578Z"}
