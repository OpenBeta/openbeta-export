Plenty of routes in a very urban environment, expect some people as along a paved running and bike path, but most will not get in the way as there is grass for the setup and belay, definitely enough room for a crash-pad as well."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:58.156Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:09.955Z"}
