We now know that these crushers called it Shrinking Arête. \n\n   Sit start and the low right edge of the arête on the small block at the base. Use the low side-pull and far right foot at the low right side of the base. Lurch up and right to a pocket or higher sloper. Follow the low side of the arête to the top where you will negotiate the crimp rail. Swing feet left once on the crimp rail to a distant left foot hold and commence the tricky top out. \n\n  -As a side note, there is a resident bat that sleeps under the huge undercling hold to the far back of the boulder. Please do not disturb this little dude. Hes just chillin' and there is no problem near him... Even if there were, its his house so dont mess with him.
