Although you cant paddle up this one using both sides, it is quite thin and pointed at the top.

The front thin side is great however, and the height up top makes for a committing scramble over the point."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:06.614Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:08:02.362Z"}
