The main downhill-most face is loaded with features, but most prove to be pretty difficult to hang on to due to the steep angle. There are several great lines on Hill Top and most are pretty challenging. This boulder is almost impossible to see from the trail (if you know what youre looking for you can barely make out the slabby top from the trail in the winter) but the scramble up to it isnt that bad, just be on the lookout for those tricky loose rocks."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:06.616Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:45.466Z"}
