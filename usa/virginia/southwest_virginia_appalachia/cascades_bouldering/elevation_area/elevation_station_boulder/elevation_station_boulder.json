Located directly behind/above the Side Show Block and about 3 minute from the parking lot. \n\n  This thing protrudes out from the hillside and incorporates a blank roof with a featured face above. The landscape and height give this boulder a highball feel. \n\n  To the right side of the boulder is an inclined thin block resting against it at an angle... \n\n  Lots of good problems, I did one to the left side and one on the right. Both had some loose choss at the top. Please clean this to make them worthwhile and post the finished line on here. I literally pulled off three chunks at the top out on the left line. The first 5 moves on the left one were amazing tough..."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:06.615Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:18.369Z"}
