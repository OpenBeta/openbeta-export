Work out the big roof to reach the far lip of the roof for the standard \"Flag Roof\" top out which is to the right of the outer face with a left hand on the shallow, obvious pocket.  \n\n  For the top out, once above the sloper top, the \"second tier\" ridge of rock has a massive jug. Match that jug and then anything goes for feet. The close boulder to the right is always \"off\" until this jug, and topping out by finishing the huge, easy slab isnt necessary.
