Then blast up and over the lip to work the nasty HP40-like slopers. \n\n  Work higher on the slopers and up to the crimp/flat rail. Stand up and clamber over. \n\n  This was FAd in the hot summer humidity and without a solid cleaning. It felt v6/7ish in those conditions but it should likely settle at around v4 when its nice and crisp and clean? Regardless it is a good one!
