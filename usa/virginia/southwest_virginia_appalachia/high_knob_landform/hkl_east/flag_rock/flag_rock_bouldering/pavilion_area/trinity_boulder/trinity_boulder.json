Pop up through the jug breaks while trending onto the right main face. \n\n  Reach up with your right to the only hold within reach, the perfect, tiny, two finger pocket. Get higher feet, lock off the pocket, and power up high to any of the higher pockets (there are many in a row, one of which is better than the others). \n\n  Move to the MASSIVE jug above, and figure out the sketchy highball finish. \n\n  -Named \"Trinity For Life\" for the spray paint tag \"Lisa Trinity For Life\" on the small block below... \n\n  Disclaimer: I wont pretend like I have a clue about accurate grades on this, or most of my FAs. This was FAd in the hot summer humidity and without a solid brushing. It felt v5ish in those conditions but it will likely go at a v2/3/4??? Vote your opinion here and lets build a solid consensus.
