It is in the MIDDLE of the Roanoke Valley and people swarm there on Saturdays and Sundays. During the week it is not heavily populated but the chances of you seeing at least one person are strong. As of now climbing is not listed on the sign of things not allowed on Read Mountain. Let's work HARD to keep it this way. There is no camping, fires, mountain biking, etc. etc. So while we have access, let's make a good impression and clean up after ourselves and others, be respectful, and most importantly... safe."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:00.731Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:06.128Z"}
