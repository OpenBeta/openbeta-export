The boulders are on the smaller side (8-12 feet), sit starts are recommended to maximize route length. On the flip side you probably won't need any pads, nor have to drive as far to Grayson or Breaks (coming from central/southern VA). Rock quality is high.From the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation:Buffalo Mountain is one of the most significant natural areas in Virginia, supporting an amazing 15 rare plant occurrences, three rare animals and nine significant natural communities. The combination of high-elevation (3,971 feet), wind-exposed rocky openings at the summit, and magnesium rich soils make it unlike any place else in the Commonwealth."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:01.256Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:07.378Z"}
