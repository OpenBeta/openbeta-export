Find the tree that is close to the boulder on the right side and then move about 4 ft to the left to start sitting on a good hold. Move up and slightly to the right as you climb on awesome edges and flowy moves. Eventually you'll reach some underclings near the top and then find a way with the pebbles and small edges on the lip to surmount the slabby giant! The tree is nice cuz if you get spooked you can always lean back and bail! Just remember to watch the dab!","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"XH2GcT1SXLmujv5bLP93Fg==","name":"Lice is Rice","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"Parker Reed","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.79723,37.3101]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118989155","mp_crag_id":"118989148","climb_id":"XH2GcT1SXLmujv5bLP93Fg==","areaRef":"yBs/QMXmXlKCkU6O7siwng=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start on low horizontal ledge between boulder and downhill sloping rock.
