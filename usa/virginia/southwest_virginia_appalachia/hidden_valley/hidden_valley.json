In addition, adjacent land owners hunt on their property and have asked that climbers do not bring dogs onto their property. In order to reduce the potential for conflicts, DOGS ARE NOT ALLOWED, DO NOT BRING YOUR DOG TO HIDDEN VALLEY.\"\n\n In 2015, the CCC purchased access to the cliffs at Hidden Valley. Although a small handful of the 450 existing routes lie on CCC property, the majority of the climbing at Hidden Valley is not on CCC property. There are several land managers and owners in the mix at Hidden Valley, each with varying understanding of, or formal acceptance of climbing.\n\n Because of these access uncertainties, the CCC asks that route-specific information be kept off the internet.
