The top is too tall to highball with the rocky landing below, but also too short to put in bolts for routes. The upper rock bands look a litle chossy too, but the lower is perfect. We've just deemed problems here \"hang and drops\", although the idea is to mantle over and get to a point that you can stand with no hands at the end. While nowhere as aesthetic as the many giant freestanding boulders around, this is a wonderful proving ground for hard roof climbing and mantle skills. Â The roof is about 12-13 feet of horizontal terrain leading to fun and difficult mantles to a slabby upper face where you can end climbs balanced with no hands. Under the roof are fun chunky pinches and features. Bring plenty of pads to cover the big jumbled blocks at the landing.This roof is also good option for wet days or really cold days when everything else is frigid or frozen. This face bakes in the sun all day. After it rains, this one is quick to dry."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:08.508Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:08:04.688Z"}
