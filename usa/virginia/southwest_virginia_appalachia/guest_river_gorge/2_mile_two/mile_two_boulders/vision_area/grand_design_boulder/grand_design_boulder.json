So, before attempting, be absolutely sure you have no issue with backing off of the top of a 20+ft boulder that is overhung at the very top, and back tracking the thin holds. \n\n  The sketchy FA was done with one pad and no spotters. \n\n  Stand start to the far left of the roof on the backside of the boulder, to the right of the tree. There are good, thin, rounded holds to start on. Follow directly up the initially slabby face past thin crimps and good rails. Work higher up to the vertical section with nice holds. At the top are deep slots and the face becomes slightly overhung. Gain the good lip and rock over.
