This singular boulder problem is probably the most interesting and eye-catching line I've climbed.\n\n Sit start under the wild looking \"wing\" overhang (looks like an eagle’s beak, a witch’s nose, a fin, a wing, what have you) on a hollow but sturdy flake jug matched.\n\n Off the start, move up past 14 or so pinch and compression moves along the right side of the boulder. Pinch your way up until you can reach out with your left hand to the wide side-pull pinch to compress again.\n\n Lock off and get to the iron rail (on the face opposite the trail). Grab the left crimp and blast up to the top.\n\n Top out and sit on top of the feature.\n\n Getting down is an adventure right now. My exit strategy was jumping off the boulder onto pads on the patio. Another is negotiating over to the tree that touches the tip of the \"wing\" and fireman pole down. The down-climb still needs to be cleaned.","protection":"PADS.
