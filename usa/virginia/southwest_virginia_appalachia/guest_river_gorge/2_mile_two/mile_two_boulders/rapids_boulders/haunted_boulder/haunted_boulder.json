The roof has a beautiful swirling pool in the base, and if the river is up part of this problem becomes submerged. Most Fall and Winter seasons however, the water is low and the line is perfect. \n\n  Stand start in the slot jug that is very deep in the back of the roof along the crack/seam with the roof and side wall (typically the deep start slot is only a step away from the edge of the pool). \n\n  Work through many moves to a nice pinch brick and continue through onto the large flake feature. Continue up and direct above the flake with the help of some iron ripples to top out high.","protection":"many pads and at least one spotter","location":"Haunted Boulder"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a42e6847-4548-5299-820a-7a75bfe34c71,c4221374-ca4e-5dc9-9b03-65f3effa0633,b73e8dc2-9195-541d-b64f-9d9c1d9a7571,1a4b991d-09d4-5d45-996f-16dc52a34a6f,16d40366-a883-529a-a3d0-af535efdd995,3b622699-00ea-5e0f-9d8c-424c29277523,8392b05f-5c97-5237-87b4-00ab70c861ed","pathTokens":["USA","Virginia","Southwest Virginia (Appalachia)","Guest River Gorge","(2) Mile Two","Mile Two Boulders","Rapids Boulders","Haunted Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.41999,36.8995]},"bbox":[-82.42055229318755,36.89905033981814,-82.41942770681246,36.89994966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112318952","area_id":"g5KwX1yXUjeHtACrcMhh7Q=="},"content":{"description":"This boulder is huge and halfway in the Guest River.
