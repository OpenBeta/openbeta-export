The closest one is Main Bench, the one just beyond it is Side Bench.\n\n During high water these are completely unclimbable, with sometimes half of the holds underwater. During normal river flow, some serious effort would need to go into building water landings. Only during low water stages or drought can these be climbed easily.\n\n Main Bench has a gorgeous inside face with a handful of very fun, easy to moderate, exciting problems to explore. A few pads to protect the rocky landing are needed."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:13.976Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:26.990Z"}
