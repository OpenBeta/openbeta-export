The closest one is Main Bench, the one just beyond it is Side Bench.\n\n During high water these are completely unclimbable, with sometimes half of the holds underwater. During normal river flow, some serious effort would need to go into building water landings. Only during low water stages or drought can these be climbed easily.\n\n Side Bench has a long inside face with a handful of excellent climbs. The close block creates a tight corridor that needs to be well padded for most of the middle lines, but the left-most and right-most lines are open and easy to pad."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:13.975Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:55.709Z"}
