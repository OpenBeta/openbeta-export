There are tons of jugs and pockets you can climb on, but I wouldn't really rate anything above a VB. You can also easily climb up the front of the dish and get a nice view. It's worth stopping by just to see this rock if you're near Devil's Kitchen."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:14.641Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:22.719Z"}
