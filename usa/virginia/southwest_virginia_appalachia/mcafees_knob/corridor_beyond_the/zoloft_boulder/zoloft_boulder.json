Seth Blanchard and I \"discovered\" this boulder hidden in a jungle of Rhododendron or Mountain Laurel (can't remember which). It is literally within sight from the corridor but yet no one ever clawed there way through the bushes to see this small looking boulder. To our surprise the boulder was taller than it looked and was slightly overhanging on the front side. After hours of serious Lichen Scrubbing Seth and I put up Decreased Sex Drive and the other easier lines and we began working Tremor. After a few trips to the knob it finally went down on cooler temps. A nice eliminate line remains going straight up to the apex of the boulder just left of where Decreased Sex Drive tops out. The current line jumps Left to the path of least resistance to the Thank God Jugs!
