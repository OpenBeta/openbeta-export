Round the boulder to where you see the two boulders (Hero & Sidekick) meet. Look for the thin crack on Hero called the \"Cumulonimbus Crack\". To the left of the crack, look for the low thin crimps that are side-by-side. This is the start. \n\n  Match the two thin crimps and find the low left foot jib/flake under the steeper low portion of the face. \n\n  Pick up off of the crimps and make a tough right hand catch onto the close, higher, tiny, sharp crimp above. From there move left to a credit card edged crimp intermediate and the progress up and left again to the larger flake (looks large but the useable part is terribly thin). Move from the flake, up and right to gain the higher small rail. Continue to a better hold which gives-way to the great top-out. \n\n  Note: You will find on this line, as with most of the other holds on this specific boulder, that in the 90's someone reinforced the little holds with a small stripe of cement glue. There are very few boulders in GHSP where you will ever find this. I believe the gluing was from a small handful of climbers in the early 90's who only climbed on these boulders over a brief period of time. \n\n  The crimps aren't glued on, but \"reinforcement\" so the hold wouldn't break off in the future. The mystery cementer added a small, usually hard to see, stripe of cement in the back of the holds... I doubt the crimps were ever tested after the gluing as most edges of the crimps and flakes were extremely thin, chipping down or breaking when I initially attempted to use them. I don't feel the glue takes away from the problems now since nothing can be done about it, its a part of the history of the area, and the lines are still amazing. Enjoy!
