Bring brushes, as these lines dont get any traffic aside from the occasional intrepid explorer.\n\n The Wilderness Boulder is a short, steep, blank-faced boulder. The only problems existing are on the sides of the boulder along the overhanging, short aretes. \n\n  The Wilderness Boulder is located directly beside of the Wilderness Arete. From the Rage Boulders, hike slightly uphill to the crest of the Rhododendrons and then cut left across the wide saddle. The Arete and larger overhanging boulder are both facing away and opposite of the Rage Boulders, so look carefully"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:07.089Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:13.640Z"}
