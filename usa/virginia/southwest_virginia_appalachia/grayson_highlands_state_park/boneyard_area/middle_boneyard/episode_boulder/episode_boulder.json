The large flat ledge below is used as a foot, and any combination of tiny chips and ripples will be key for a right starting foot.\n\n Inspect the featureless face for any holds that can be used for hands. As a hint, the tiny two finger chip high and left may help, and a high right hand pinch can be nice to use as well. Also multiple thin fingertip crimps are found low and right. This is a one move wonder... Just pull on, establish, and fire to the top. good luck.\n\nPost factum: We did this problem again today and found an alternate start with the same high left hand, but a way lower crimp undercling for your right.
