This part of the trail seem boulder-less.. Continue past the lookout for 5 minutes and you will find the seemingly short, elongated \"Autumn Boulder\". Upon further inspection you will see that the boulder continues underneath for about an average of 8 feet.    From the trail, walk around the low Autumn Boulder, through the clustered corridor (there will be a large, tall overhanging and stacked boulder to your right) and the big long slabby boulder at the end is the Mr. Casual Boulder. Walk around to the downhill portion of the Mr. Casual Boulder and across from the Downhill-most tip of the boulder you will see a small, unassuming block/fin/overhang with a very small block underneath. This is Bass-Ackwards Block. Look uphill from this and you will see another small block. This is the Mojo Block. Eski-Mojo starts in the large crack under the short roof."},"__v":0},{"_id":"FOkYgTfsUjqUxPjCchsDLw==","name":"Eski-Mo Cowbell","yds":"V2-3","grades":{"yds":"V2-3","font":"5+","vscale":"V2-3"},"fa":"Aaron James Parlier","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.50167,36.62279]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107397768","mp_crag_id":"107282121","climb_id":"FOkYgTfsUjqUxPjCchsDLw==","areaRef":"bDWSgaMrUMmsjVVlOTVOzQ=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start under the small roof to the left of the thin crack line.
