To the left (climbers left) of that nearby low block, find the very thin, long, low crimp rail to start matched on.  \n\n  Sit start and pop up through thin crimps to lunge to the better, higher right edge. From there climb direct to the rounded but good holds to top out. \n\nSide Note: 3 Shades of Black is also the name of a terrible, terrible song. If you don't like the sound of screaming and odd metal music interjected into something close to a country song, skip the video.
