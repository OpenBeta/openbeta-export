Very enticing sounding I know, but to be honest it's hard to resist. \n\n  As you walk down from Underking, this tall portion of the Galaxy wall that jumps up from the side of the hill before you round the corner to the main downhill facing wall and the Galaxy Boulder just begs to be climbed. \n\n  This is just before the main face on the side of the Galaxy Wall. \n\n  Locate the low juggy ledge feature to start matched on. Climb up through easy holds to a thinner spot on the face up high. Overcome this and there are better holds to top out on.  \n\n  I highly recommend going up top to ensure a clean top out.","protection":"pads/spotters","location":"Galaxy Wall"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a42e6847-4548-5299-820a-7a75bfe34c71,c4221374-ca4e-5dc9-9b03-65f3effa0633,522337f4-f041-5101-b2a3-4603eebbf4b4,69c913a0-defc-5823-b9b4-87d727c8fb64,24363cf4-8ee9-521a-bb09-258c3df5cfec,71564d02-d523-5e20-aba2-6b12c0a8c78b,171603b8-be47-566d-9cb1-81c67eb3f30b","pathTokens":["USA","Virginia","Southwest Virginia (Appalachia)","Grayson Highlands State Park","Listening Rock Trail","Moonlight","Ginseng","Galaxy Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0-1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.4912,36.6122]},"bbox":[-81.49176019123227,36.611750339818144,-81.49063980876772,36.61264966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107414273","area_id":"FxYDuL5HVm2csYHGfrPzCw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-81.49176019123227,36.611750339818144],[-81.49063980876772,36.611750339818144],[-81.49063980876772,36.61264966018186],[-81.49176019123227,36.61264966018186],[-81.49176019123227,36.611750339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":"This massive wall has a rough landing and is undeniably highball.
