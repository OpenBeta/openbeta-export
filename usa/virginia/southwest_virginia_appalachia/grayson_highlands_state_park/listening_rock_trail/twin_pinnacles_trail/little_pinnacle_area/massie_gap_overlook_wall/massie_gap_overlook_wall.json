As with the Little Pinnacle Wall, instead of naming each of these Vb-V1's, its easier and simpler to just refer to this as a beginners area. Also, as with the Little Pinnacle Wall, be very careful due to the rocky, uneven landing zone. \n\n  Please do not brush, clean, or damage any plantlife if you do choose to climb here. for a more serious climbing session, please opt to climb in the wonderful LRT bouldering area below the parking lot."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:07.093Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:19.388Z"}
