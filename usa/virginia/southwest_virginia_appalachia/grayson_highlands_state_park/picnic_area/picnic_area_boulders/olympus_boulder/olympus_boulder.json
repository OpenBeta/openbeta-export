This boulder is one of the largest in Grayson Highlands State Park. It is also likely home to some of, if not the most difficult lines and projects found in the park. Along with all of these complements it too has the shortest and easiest approach, and nearest restrooms and a drink machine.... it's got it all (with a grade range from V1-V12 to keep you busy!). This boulder stretches nearly 100 feet or more in length. It has two sides; the first you come to is short and has a shallow overhanging bottom leading up to a vertical top-side. As you walk along this side the height grows in height until you get to the arête where the overhang is above your head you top out at about 13 or 14 feet. Around the corner past the arête the face become massive and steep. It also continues to become taller, reaching 20 feet in some places. Along the front main 45 degree face you will find that the center has a large crack which separates Olympus into two faces. For problem clarification I state \"left or right\" blade or boulder."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":26,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:15.608Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:57.098Z"}
