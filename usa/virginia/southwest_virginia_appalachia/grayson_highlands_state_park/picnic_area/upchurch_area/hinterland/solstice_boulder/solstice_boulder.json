I tried this from a lower re-enforced chip, but it exploded as I pulled on. This jug start seems good to go though. \n\n  Pull on matched in the jug. Make a fun move to the higher, long jug ledge, and work to the right jug. Move right again to a good chunk, and then follow delicate ripples and crimps to the massive block at the top. Use the block to help finish.","protection":"pads","location":"Solstice"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a42e6847-4548-5299-820a-7a75bfe34c71,c4221374-ca4e-5dc9-9b03-65f3effa0633,522337f4-f041-5101-b2a3-4603eebbf4b4,1f2d2ba4-16e9-5c8f-8047-c7801dd36f83,359c4558-2a60-510e-8645-c237f5635772,81bd7b12-1cc5-59f2-b106-b5968dc24ee9,8e6cf9af-f7c1-5ae0-ba83-6b56bdb2877b","pathTokens":["USA","Virginia","Southwest Virginia (Appalachia)","Grayson Highlands State Park","Picnic Area","Upchurch Area","Hinterland","Solstice Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.4912,36.6122]},"bbox":[-81.49176019123227,36.611750339818144,-81.49063980876772,36.61264966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109092364","area_id":"jmz5r/fBWuC6g2tWvbKHew=="},"content":{"description":"Long and low, this steep boulder has a couple great ones to choose from.
