The stone on many instances may be loose or hollow; although out of the three problems climbed on it this far, only one large chunk was pulled off, and it was a top portion that was removed out of safety after it was climbed. Nonetheless, use caution when climbing. \n\n  Also, bring many pads and travel in numbers if this is to be your destination. The landing is littered with huge blocks and scattered chunks.
