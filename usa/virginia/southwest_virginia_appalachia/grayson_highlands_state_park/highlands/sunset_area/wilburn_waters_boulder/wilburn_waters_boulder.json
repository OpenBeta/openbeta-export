He hunted bear and wolf in the highlands in the 1800's and his adventures are well beyond belief. The Wilburn Ridge is named in his honor as well. A book that retails some of his more notable adventures is sold in the office and visitors center and its worth a look. He went hand to hand with black bears and wolves on multiple occasions This type of determination might help you get to the top of this highball.
