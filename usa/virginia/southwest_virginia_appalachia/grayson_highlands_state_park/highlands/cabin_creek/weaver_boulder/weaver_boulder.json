This is the same rock as is found in the Highlands, as opposed to the Metamorphic sandstone. \n\n  --Note This is a free standing boulder with a tricky down-climb through dirty slab (as of now it is very dirty and overgrown). My best advice is to walk over to the close-by big tree and swing around it to \"bear-hug\" the tree and use your feet to \"walk\" down the boulder... Silly but effective, and you don't have to damage the plant life on the boulder this was as well! \n\n  Be sure to scope out the problem write up on GHSP Bouldering! graysonhighlandsbouldering.â€¦"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:13.415Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:26.225Z"}
