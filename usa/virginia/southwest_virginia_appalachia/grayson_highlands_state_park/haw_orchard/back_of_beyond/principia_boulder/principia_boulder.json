Find the high seam, crack, slot and stand start on the lower block. \n\n  The standard for this problem is to start matched on the obvious block/horn below the main boulder. Use this as feet, but anything \"left of the crack/seam\" on the low block is strictly \"off.\" \n\n  Off the block, reach up to the first good in-cut crimp rail, and pull higher to the match-able crimp/flake. Make a harsh gaston far to the left in the seam/slot. Get a high foot and cross over to gain the higher crimp edge along the slot. Pop high to the crescent, deep crimp-jug.
