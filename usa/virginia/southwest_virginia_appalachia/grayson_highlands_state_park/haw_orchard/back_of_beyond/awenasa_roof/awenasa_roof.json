The starting hands are the nice crimp rail (for your left) and any of the deep flakes to the right (right hand). Pick up and toss back to the good rail, and continue past several more flat crimps to the furthest (better) crimp directly under the roof.  \n\n  Bump far and left to the flat/slopey jug and fall into it to continue through juggy holds to the flat lip to top out. \n\nNote: When climbing out of the first section, stay beneath the roof. The far right corner is uncleaned intentionally and wont help the line if cleaned. Please leave the vegetation untouched (its been climbed without anything harmed, so lets keep it that way. If you find yourself brushing off any lichen or moss you are climbing the wrong line).","protection":"pads? No need for the middle where you swing (you will dab on pads).
