It is the large boulder beside the other large boulder that has the huge cap roof. It sits directly beside the also huge Dream Boulder. At one time in the distant geological past the two boulders split apart, leaving a narrow and beautiful corridor between the two (as well as the wild looking cap roof that hangs off of the Dream Boulder). \n\n  The King and Dream boulders mark the lowest and most distant in the line-up of awesome boulders in the Back of Beyond Area. \n\n  The King Boulder is tall, with the vast majority of climbs here being fun, sometimes scary slabs with wonderfully interesting holds. The very top of the boulder is a sharply angled corner spine. Once you climb to the top you need to negotiate the top spine all the way across to the shorter up-hill end to get off the boulder. \n\n  There are three trees growing beside the King Boulder at the inside corridor face. These trees help find the location of some of the boulder problems on the King Boulder."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:10.719Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:23.552Z"}
