This is the continuation of \"Fool's Face\", and can be accessed via the 5.6 slab or just running up either side gully and rejoining the ridge. Ultimately like its neighbor these ridge scrambles almost always have an opportunity to bail because generally the gully on either side is relatively close. It should be noted though that there are certainly times where you are really on some exposed knife edge ridges with maybe 80ft on one side and 40ft on the other. SO all I'm saying is don't take this as a super casual little jaunt if you truly stick to the ridge, you certainly need to keep your wits about you. It is certainly suitable as a solo, but if you are bringing people who are less experienced it might be nice to do some short pitches if anyone is feeling sketched!","protection":"A small rack for perhaps the headwall and if you are bringing up less experienced climbers. Many opportunities to sling a horn or boulder or tree to make short pitches if necessary.","location":"The first of the two ridges when trending downstream. This one is the continuation of the routes which are known as \"Fools Face\". Bolts are found at the end of the initial headwall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a42e6847-4548-5299-820a-7a75bfe34c71,c4221374-ca4e-5dc9-9b03-65f3effa0633,58e058bb-0db7-528e-9206-2022c4cd9297,3ae35681-a14f-5eac-a8cf-c8b51dcc6ecf,0756ad7c-01cb-5722-b7eb-491ff148f01e","pathTokens":["USA","Virginia","Southwest Virginia (Appalachia)","Junction, The","Ridge I","Ridge Proper"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.60463,37.24504]},"bbox":[-80.6051948611232,37.244590339818146,-80.6040651388768,37.24548966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119453958","area_id":"B1atfAHLVyK360kf8UjwHg=="},"content":{"description":"The actual ridge."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:14.640Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:27.542Z"}
