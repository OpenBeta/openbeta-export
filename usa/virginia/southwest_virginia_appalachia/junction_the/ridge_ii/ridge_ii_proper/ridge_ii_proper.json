There are almost always opportunities for you to increase the sketchiness or make it mellow and generally you can bail off the ridge if necessary. Done without a rope makes maybe the most sense however like \"Ridge I\" there are sections which certainly require attention. If you have elected to skip the headwall 5th class pitch the crux of the route starts by the short bulge you must surmount directly from the top of the headwall (this may be the only place you would want a rope). The ridge stays relatively solid until the top where you will have to connect broken sections via grass hills and bushwhacking making for a proper esoteric adventure! ","protection":"A small rack for perhaps the headwall and if you are bringing up less experienced climbers. Many opportunities to sling a horn or boulder or tree to make short pitches if necessary.","location":"You can start the ridge avoiding the 5th class headwall by scurrying up the gully between the two ridges and finding an entrance roughly 50 ft above the base, this may be relatively ambiguous, but ultimately it is truly \"pick your own adventure\" so just have fun with the route finding madness. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a42e6847-4548-5299-820a-7a75bfe34c71,c4221374-ca4e-5dc9-9b03-65f3effa0633,58e058bb-0db7-528e-9206-2022c4cd9297,8c89ddcf-9912-52a2-b27f-62c7723dafcb,417781e2-9886-5604-b0bc-fd9b5e2ecb26","pathTokens":["USA","Virginia","Southwest Virginia (Appalachia)","Junction, The","Ridge II","Ridge II Proper"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.60496,37.24525]},"bbox":[-80.60552486269724,37.24480033981814,-80.60439513730277,37.24569966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119454018","area_id":"QXeB4piGVgSwvP2bXi7LJg=="},"content":{"description":"The parallel running ridge."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:29:01.260Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:07.094Z"}
