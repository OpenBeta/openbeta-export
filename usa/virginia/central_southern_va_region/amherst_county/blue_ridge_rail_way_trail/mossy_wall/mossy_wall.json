Also it is a great place to climb for the new outside climber looking to get on the sharp end with some sport or trad leads. Be advised though that Parks and Rec does no permit access to the anchors by walking to the top of the crag or topping out. All routes must be led for top rope set up. When possible use a stick clip. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:53.720Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:47.642Z"}
