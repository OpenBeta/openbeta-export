This climb is so awesome though with a real punchy start that requires explosive power ! The rest requires pure grit to stay on, groveling all the way to the Hail Mary juggy pinch. The only drawback to this boulder is that the smaller boulder to left poses quite the dab potential which can be very frustrating. In order to avoid the frustration I opted for a more compression / direct version which might be a grade harder and certainly more contrived (I do however recommend trying to stay purely on the front face because it is mega fun) . But several people have now repeated it and it seems the way that I thought would be ultra dabby works relatively well and definitely is easier but doesn't take away any of the fun !! The climb is SDS with left hand on arete and right hand on meaty pinch , go straight up !","protection":"2-3 pads ... sloped hill landing","location":"Left side of boulder "},"__v":0},{"_id":"7fcTUfHiULiO81TvLSNxWw==","name":"Siren Song","yds":"V7","grades":{"yds":"V7","font":"7A+","vscale":"V7"},"fa":"Nicolas Ferree","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.45422,37.52552]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"120163304","mp_crag_id":"120004146","climb_id":"7fcTUfHiULiO81TvLSNxWw==","areaRef":"Al7FQ5sTUvewAfgQ4KZ4Jg=="},"content":{"description":"Start on two crimps low on the center of the face: a small left pocket looking hold and a right dish below the main crimp rail.

Once you get down into the basin this boulder will really get you psyched with a really awesome face that has some techy spicy climbs ! The real test piece is \"La Femme Fatale\" but the other climbs are well worth the visit. Expect on some of the side boulders to have to negotiate an engaging steep hill which creates pad management chaos muahahaha !! Its actually pretty awesome, because when you are topping out \"CHOMP CHOMP\" you really feel like you are on quite the highball (but completely safe) ! Anyway come and enjoy !   \n\n  P.S.
