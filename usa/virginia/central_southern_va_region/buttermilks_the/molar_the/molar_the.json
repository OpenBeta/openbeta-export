There's some interesting rock up the hill toward the road but nothing really worth trying to climb as far as I could tell. There is one decent boulder though - steep, very geometric, easy on the skin. Seeing as it's two minutes from parking, it's worth checking out. I'm sure folks have been down here and climbed this thing before, so if you know of pre-existing problems, grades, names, FAs, please add to/correct what I have."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:54.343Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:58.422Z"}
