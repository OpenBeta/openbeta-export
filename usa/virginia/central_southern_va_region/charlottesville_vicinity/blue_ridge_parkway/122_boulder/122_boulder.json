I think it is a nice addition to the boulder as it is relatively safe yet still tops out. It is not such an obvious line but turned out to be fun.I was not sure if this crosses the threshold of being too close to the road. In my opinion no as the climber, pads, and spotters would not be in the road. But use good judgement and maybe wait until no cars are coming before climbing?
