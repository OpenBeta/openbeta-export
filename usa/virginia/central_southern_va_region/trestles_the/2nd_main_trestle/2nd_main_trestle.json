The climbing is actually pretty interesting, making use of a couple side pulls and you even get some genuine jugs in the rock, instead of just in the cracks.  \n\n  I couldn't find a name for this route anywhere else so I named it Third Eye on my drawing. Afterwards, my friend told me it used to be called Snake Hole. I don't see what difference it makes, but if the first ascentionist wants me to change it back, I will.
