Start on the East side corner of the wall and start traversing to the left as the wall increases in height. Start section is a little difficult due to the lack of space. Middle section is rife with rest opportunities and rewards good movement. Crux comes as you reach the last 5 ‘blocks’ on the western face. Bring a crashpad and a buddy, or scope out where you think you’ll go high on the wall and place pad(s) there.","protection":"","location":"The wall is hard to miss. It is the only man-made stone wall overlooking the river off of Oregon Hill Parkway in Richmond, VA.
