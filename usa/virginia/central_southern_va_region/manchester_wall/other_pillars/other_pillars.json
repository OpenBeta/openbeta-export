Many of them are always in the water, only getting down to the river mud on extremely dry years, and that mud is a poor surface to put a rope on, much less your feet-usually up to your knees. Boat access is preferred, dry/cheap old ropes reccommended, and using care not to drop anything expensive in the water..well, obvious."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:53.716Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:29.591Z"}
