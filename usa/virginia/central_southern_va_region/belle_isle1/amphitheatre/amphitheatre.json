Winter and fall are the best seasons to climb here when the vegetation is low. Watch out for the ice that gathers in some areas during the winter. The rock definitely needs some cleaning as there is a lot of loose dirt, especially towards the top. There are several noticeable routes. One is a corner to a small roof, just left of a large flake that has chains for top-roping but could possibly be done as a bouldering problem. About 20 feet to the right of the flake, another problem begins on two decent crimps. There are several other possible routes that need some serious cleaning. DonÂ’t even bother coming here in the summer, the vegetation is out of control, the bugs are terrible, and the crowds that hangout by the river across the trail are obnoxious and trash the place."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:53.720Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:57.945Z"}
