Once you got to the shield there was a place to place a cam straight up under the little roof with a double runner, but then there was a simple move to the left to a key hand hold that put me into the corner and I could move around that small corner and then continue up along the left side in a channel to the top.  \n\n  The harder variation you have to place that cam with a double runner because of the rope drag otherwise, and you go straight up and over...I didn't lead this variation.\"","protection":"nuts, tricams, cams up to #2 BD size and small cams (C3s or Metolius).","location":"Begin in the same area where Kopley's Corner and Longhorn start.
