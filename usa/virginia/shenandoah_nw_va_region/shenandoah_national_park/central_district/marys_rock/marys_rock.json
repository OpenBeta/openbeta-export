This area is listed in Eric Horst's guide, \"Rock Climbing Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland\" without any route descriptions. There are a decent number of potential boulder problems, and some rope route potential as well.  \n\n  In addition to the rock at the top of the trail, there are some fantastic looking boulders adjacent to the trail itself. Just do best not to block the trail for hikers as this is a very popular hike."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:28:58.590Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:36.095Z"}
