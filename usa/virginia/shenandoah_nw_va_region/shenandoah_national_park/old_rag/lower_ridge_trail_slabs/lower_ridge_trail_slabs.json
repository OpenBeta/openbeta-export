You will come to a rock slot that you will need to wiggle through.  Just past this slot is the first major rock outcropping.  This rock outcropping has a large, exposed rock formation, which looks reminiscent of a loaf of bread, sitting atop a slab.  This is the first major outlook that people like to stop at.  At this outcrop, you look down and to your right.  You will see a large 100+ft slab that has a large, evergreen tree growing out from the upper portions of it (do not confuse this with The Whale's Lip.  Look near, not far).  Below this tree you can see a crack line.  This is your destination. \n\n  From the outcrop, continue on the ridge trail through the rock scrambling.  You will come to a col (aka saddle) in the trail.  The trail will continue up hill to more rock outcroppings.  Do not ascend the established trail any further.  Rather, at this col descend the vegetated gulley that is to your left.  Continue down the vegetated, rocky hillside until the terrain gets a little flatter.  At this point, make a yawning turn gently to the right.  Continue through the vegetation on relatively flat ground (ok, really relative).
