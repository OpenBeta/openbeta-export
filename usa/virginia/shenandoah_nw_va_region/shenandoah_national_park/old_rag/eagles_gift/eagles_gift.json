Having one or two long slings is handy, as is a small wire brush for the lichen. A 50m rope is needed for the rappel.  THERE IS NO ANCHOR!\n\n Needles Style Rappel is a form of “simul rap” with one climber going off each side of a formation while the rope runs over the top. It can be achieved by having one person lower to the ground first. With the rope tight to the ground person that is still tied in, a partner can then lay the rope across the top of the formation, preferably into a notch or groove that is not too sharp, and rap off of the other side using the weight of the partner on the ground to anchor and counterbalance the descent. A GriGri etc or prusik backup is recommended. DO NOT attempt this unless you fully understand how to do it and the risk associated with it. Success hinges on trusting your partner, timing, and ensuring your rope is well placed in a notch to prevent it from rolling off the top. The final step to ensuring success during a NSR is to double check your partner is on the ground before going “off rappel”.","location":"The route is on the boulder formation immediately east of the Eagle’s Gift Slab, which forms the “hallway” you walk through to approach the base of The Eagle’s Gift routes.  It has a distinct saddle-like curve on the knife edge summit ridge."},"__v":0},{"_id":"AN2bF/dPVVCMmMFuzsOjrg==","name":"A Visit From Juan","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Sandy Fleming, John Vidumsky, 1983","type":{"trad":true,"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.3106,38.5515]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107850494","mp_crag_id":"106246947","climb_id":"AN2bF/dPVVCMmMFuzsOjrg==","areaRef":"2WAgoupfVSmi6bqVNtMyWA=="},"content":{"description":"Begin on the same ledge as The Ally, on the left side.
