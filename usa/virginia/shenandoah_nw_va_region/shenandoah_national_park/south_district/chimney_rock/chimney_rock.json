While the crack is fist-sized for more than half the route, there are plenty of fissures to the right of the crack to slot stoppers or small cams. \n\n  It is also possible to scramble to the top of the pillar from the trail side (south) to build a TR anchor, if that's your flavor.","location":"The route runs up a free-standing pillar of rock. The easiest approach from the end of the trail is to scramble down into the slots among the rocks and exit right (northeast) from the slot that separates the pillar from the rest of the rocky outcropping.
