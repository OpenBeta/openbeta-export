About 45-60 minutes from Sugar Hollow Overlook. \n\n  30 foot tall crag with lots of features and an amazing roof that's nearly cubed out. Some good cracks, solid top rope anchors. \n\n  If going through effort of reaching this crag it'd be best to camp out near crags base...right near stream, secluded, and fairly close to some sweet bouldering.
