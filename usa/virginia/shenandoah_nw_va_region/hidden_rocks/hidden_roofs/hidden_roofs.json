Traverse right to the first bolt and climb straight out the near-horizontal roof.\n\n I invested over 50 attempts for the send on this beautiful line, which feels about as hard as my method on Cartography (Long Branch of Smoke Hole, WV), but is probably less my \"style\". I'm proposing 5.13d, thoughÂ grades don't make any sense. V9? to V5/6?\n\n This is a fantastic climb in a very special and isolated place. Finishing this route was a total dream. I hope you learn from and enjoy whatever experience you may have with this piece of stone.\n\n And if you send... best victory whip ever... the tree branches won't hurt you!
