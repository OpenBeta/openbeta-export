First move is a reach with your right to a sweet jug that may take a few tries to find. From there Work over to the arete with the left side of your body and get read for a greasy, slopy hold that you can either bump your left to or reach over with the right to close to the top.\n\n UPDATE:  The Dorito hold broke off, so the start is a bit more difficult. But the first hold just moved slighty to the left of where the Dorito hold used to be. ","protection":"Pad and spotter","location":"You will see the boulder, it’s the biggest and the most aesthetic.
