I usually get to climb on ice here every 3-5 years because temperatures aren’t really consistently cold enough for the ice to form. But when it does there are many options here. I usually anchor above the gorge and rappel in and then climb back out. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:26.810Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:54.735Z"}
