The boulder stays well shaded and feels somewhat secluded as many climbers don't make the trip down the path to get to these climbs, but you will hear more of the highway sounds from the nearby highway. Depending on what face you are climbing, you should have safe landing zones with pads. The west facing side of the boulder tends to get sun in the afternoon and provides some very challenging, highball boulder opportunities. Watch out for glass on this side as this area still needs some cleanup (if you are in the area, bring a bucket and help do your part)!\n\n For more information about the Abominable Boulder, check out the MRG bouldering guide created by Cole Musial: ​MRG Pocket Guide​​​"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":8,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:28.515Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:31.666Z"}
