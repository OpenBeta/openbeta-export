The cliffs are above the flood plain and approximately 25-35 feet tall. The area will be muddy on the belay platform after the rain, so you may want to bring a towel or something to wipe your shoes if you choose to climb after it rains. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:28.515Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:48.076Z"}
