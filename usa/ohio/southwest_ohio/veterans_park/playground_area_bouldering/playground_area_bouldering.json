Start low on the juggy ledge (or the one below that if you like doing pullups) and stand up on the huge ledges-for-feet to some generous crimps. Gain the face proper with yet more generous crimps and then drift right to a mossy topout. Avoid going straight up for the topout as there is a lot of moss and loose dirt.I can't really tell if this has been climbed before so if anyone has any info like a route name or FA if this has (probably) already been done, please comment and I'll update the page.","protection":"a pad","location":"This route is on the broken section of cliff behind the kids' freestanding boulder.

The freestanding boulder isn't really worth any serious climbing, but makes a great addition to the playground. If you take your young ones climbing then with a little creativity you could score a few warm up laps while they play, but the real fun to be had here is on the broken cliff line behind the boulder. It looks like there is potential for a number of problems between the playground and Frathouse rock.
