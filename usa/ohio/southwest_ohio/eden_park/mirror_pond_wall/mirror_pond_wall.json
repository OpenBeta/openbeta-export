If your climb here often, please drop a route on the page so that we can all find and try it.\n\n The Mirror Pond Wall is the best wall to take beginners. There is potential to set up a top-rope on the pipe at the top, just may add a bit of wear on the rope. Mainly, the area provides just some solid bouldering. For more experienced climbers, try traversing the entire wall (its not hard).  \n\n  Depending on the time of year and when it was last cut, The Mirror Pond Wall can have an abundance of plants with burrs in front of it, so if you see lots of plants in front of the wall, avoid the wall.  \n\n  The wall starts at less than a 90-degree angle and is slightly over-hung toward the top. Its shorter than the West wall, being around 15-20 feet.    Not The best wall, but it is the easiest. Good for new climbers but fairly boring and repetitive problems. \n\n  Routes and problems are located here by \"pillars\" and \"fence-sections\".    Pillars are the large columns that are at the top of the wall, running along the fence, and fence-sections are the smaller, sections of the fence, identified by the metal parts that stick out to the very edge of the wall (pictured in the photo)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:26.802Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:53.900Z"}
