If your climb here often, please drop a route on the page so that we can all find and try it. Please use the \"pillar\" and \"fence section\" terminology for locating routes on this wall. \n\n  The Woods Wall is just an extension of the West Wall, as it collides with the woods. This means that all of it can be done on top rope. The large pockets back here can get dirtier than on the West Wall, so expect some grimy holds. There is one gem of a top rope at the buttress where the West Wall meets the Woods Wall. \n\n  FINDING ROUTES:\n\n  Routes and problems on this wall and the West Wall are located by \"pillars and \"fence-sections\".    Pillars are the large columns that are at the top of the wall, running along the fence, and fence-sections are the smaller, sections of the fence, identified by the metal parts that stick out to the very edge of the wall (pictured in the photo)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:26.191Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:02.490Z"}
