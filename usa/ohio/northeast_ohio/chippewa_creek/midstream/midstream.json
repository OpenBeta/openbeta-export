Named after the inscribed \"Bud\" at the bottom of the arete and the technique up the arete.","protection":"","location":"At Mother Goose boulder, South East Arete, left of the pocketed slab wall that is left of Mother Goose."},"__v":0},{"_id":"y+aVUznIUA2vodo4Hfncxg==","name":"Brick Work","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.6182,41.3205]},"left_right_index":24,"mp_id":"112226736","mp_crag_id":"105995179","climb_id":"y+aVUznIUA2vodo4Hfncxg==","areaRef":"ICyFLpvYUBeK3CMpW9Pyaw=="},"content":{"description":"Crimps to jug top outthe wall oozes iron deposits and looks like the mortar for bricks","protection":"1 or 2 Pads","location":"Down the hill from FIght or Flight   in between Pinch Arete and Key Hole"},"__v":0},{"_id":"5E3Rc0cDXryReCtClEiJEw==","name":"[Redacted]","yds":"V5-","grades":{"yds":"V5-","font":"6C","vscale":"V5-"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.6182,41.3205]},"left_right_index":19,"mp_id":"106641929","mp_crag_id":"105995179","climb_id":"5E3Rc0cDXryReCtClEiJEw==","areaRef":"ICyFLpvYUBeK3CMpW9Pyaw=="},"content":{"description":"Up left arete to topout.","protection":"Pad and spotter.","location":"Left arete of block head boulder, most likely sporting a water landing."},"__v":0},{"_id":"X9LwwPr/XhmRExm3Y5aadg==","name":"2-Step Marathon","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.6182,41.3205]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"120057993","mp_crag_id":"105995179","climb_id":"X9LwwPr/XhmRExm3Y5aadg==","areaRef":"ICyFLpvYUBeK3CMpW9Pyaw=="},"content":{"description":"Start on slopersBump up to sloped top Compression Crimped edge way up there","protection":"1 pad","location":"Right of sauna boulderLeft of “fight or flight”30ft down hill right before the new trail head entrance"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,5aa3fc49-2085-5aa2-b6b9-eedbe047a22b,e27bed06-6cee-5bdc-820b-9cb6ed8fe8bc,8a5ca9d3-1e5a-54c0-b131-3d019eb24e5a,202c852e-9bd8-5017-8adc-23295bd3f26b","pathTokens":["USA","Ohio","Northeast Ohio","Chippewa Creek","Midstream"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"V0"},{"count":1,"label":"V6-"},{"count":1,"label":"V3-4"},{"count":2,"label":"V3+"},{"count":5,"label":"V1"},{"count":4,"label":"V4"},{"count":1,"label":"3rd"},{"count":5,"label":"V2"},{"count":3,"label":"V7"},{"count":3,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V5-"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":28,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":2,"intermediate":10,"advanced":12,"expert":3}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":2,"intermediate":10,"advanced":12,"expert":3}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.6182,41.3205]},"bbox":[-81.61879872630145,41.320050339818145,-81.61760127369855,41.32094966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105995179","area_id":"ICyFLpvYUBeK3CMpW9Pyaw=="},"content":{"description":"Midstream from the typically drop in.."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":28,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:27.750Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-07T06:54:27.979Z"}
