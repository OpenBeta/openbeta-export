All north facing, exposed to the wind... you're standing on a beach on Lake Erie afterall. If you come on a day without wind it's pretty pleasant.  \n\n  Most of the routes can only be done on lead, the cliffs are part of the park but to set a TR you'd have to trespass through people's backyards. \n\n  Don't worry about falling through the ice and drowing in the lake, you're standing on the beach. Walk 30 ft further towards the lake and then you're standing on lake ice. Use caution/common sense/don't die. \n\n  Access Issues: Unknown. It's a city park and their aren't any rules specifically prohibiting climbing. But, it's Ohio and people are terrified of liability and human powered fun so who knows. That being said you're at the bottom of a lake cliff in winter, not exactly a high traffic area. \n\n  MP says I should include info on camping. Technically you can camp on the lake for free, go ice fishing for fresh food, and live like a king. Alternatively their is a taco bell 5 minutes down the road.  \n\n  I've led one route so far. If anyone has climbed here before leave a comment so I don't falsely claim someone's FA."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:27.253Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:55.636Z"}
