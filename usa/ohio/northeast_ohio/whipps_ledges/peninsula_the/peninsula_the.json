If you're looking at the side of the island block with dunes and the Double-O, turn around 180 degrees and you will be starring right at it. It is very sandy at the base of the wall.  The wall itself is still covered in a good bit of lichen and moss.  There are two very good trees at the top to set up anchor systems on.
