The rock is sandstone.  Almost all of the ledges are south facing and thus in many areas are quite dry and without any mosses / plant growth.  There are zero routes officially marked.   \n\n  There are no official camping spots in the park and no fees to enter.  Alcoholic beverages of any kind are forbidden in the park.  Do not bring them for any reason.   \n\n  Please do not touch rocks with moss or lichens on it.  These are important for the wildlife and need to be protected.  Stick to areas that are dry and without growth and directly adjacent to the path (walking off the path is not permitted).  This park is great for hiking to see the rocks and many rock overhangs.  It has two pretty nice waterfalls.  Also, the \"Highbridge Glens\" trail has some spectacular views of the river.  The Cuyahoga River runs through it and if you are ambitious, you can take a kayak down there and ride the river.    \n\n  Secret Sandbox and South Face (Krak) are both relatively dry overhang areas off the beaten path and nice place to start.  South facing sun with a lot of dry rock underneath the overhang.  There are also numerous other places to see nice rock faces in the park.  Choose your own adventure and tread lightly.   \n\n  Gorge has a main entrance area that can be found easily on Google.  The rock ledges begin near the entrance and go all the way to where the Gorge goes under State Rd. bridge.  There is another entrance that is a bit hidden on the East side of the State Rd. Bridge.  This is quickly accessible and gets you to the rocks quickly.  I recommend searching the location on Google. \n\n  Nearby places to eat / drink:   Before or after you hike, make a visit to Blue Door Cafe and Bakery located at 1970 State Rd., Cuyahoga Falls, OH.  This is one of the best cafes in a 100 mile radius of the area!  Super fresh made bread and great food, but check hours to make sure they are open bluedoorcafebakery.com.  You may also like to try another nearby cafe (walkable distance from Gorge, fluryscafe.com/).  This has some nice breakfast and early afternoon lunch.  Also, \"The Office\", \"Craft Beer Bar\" near downtown Cuyahoga Falls are nice for an after hike dinner / beer.  Burntwood Tavern in Downtown Cuyahoga Falls has an awesome patio overlooking the Cuyahoga River and great craft beers to choose from."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":23,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:27.253Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:55.263Z"}
