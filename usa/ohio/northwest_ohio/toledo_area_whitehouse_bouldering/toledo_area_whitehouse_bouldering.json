Be extremely careful to test each hold as the wall is full of loose rock, especially the top out on the left side of the wall. Begin traverse far right on blocky blunt arete. Stay off the ground and stay off the top loose holds and move left over some bushes, poison ivy and possibly water (during the first 7-8 months of the year.) Entire traverse to the top out is approximately 80-100 feet, but I have not measured for accuracy. [EDIT - the ground level has changed due to the work from the Metroparks clearning out the dirt, weeds, poison ivy and small trees. It is now much easier to protect with crash pads].Its not great, but it is climbing on real limestone, in Northwest Ohio.
