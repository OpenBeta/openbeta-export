Very important:  only use the hooks to lower the LAST climber in your party.  Please do NOT climb on top rope through the hooks. If more than one person is climbing the route, always clip your rope through your own quickdraws to the anchors.  Then, once everybody in your party has climbed the route, the last climber simply needs to clip the rope through the hooks, remove your draws, and be lowered.  (Anchor cleaning and rappelling is not best practice and is much more likely to lead to an accident.) The slab climbs on the left end (Katz Out of the Bag and Scaredy Katz) are both pretty tricky, but high quality, though they tend to be wet in winter and early spring.  At 10+, Katz Out of the Bag is really a total sandbag... but an outstanding climbing.The next two routes, Katz Corner and Katz in the Cradle, between a low-angle ramp feature and a large crack system, make for great beginner routes or for top-roping with kids.  Usually dry except during or right after heavy rain.The next two routes start on a vertical wall with thin features before pulling a substantial roof.  Good fun.  These are newer lines and have fragile rock, so beware that rock may continue to break for a little while here!  These dry out relatively quickly.The next section include five routes that all go the top of the cliff-line and are \"full length\" -- two trad lines and three sport lines.  All are quite good, although in very different ways! The sport routes tend to dry out quickly year round, but the trad routes stay wet most of the winter and spring and may need a bit of regular spring clean-up due to runoff and debris."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:26.804Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:29.375Z"}
