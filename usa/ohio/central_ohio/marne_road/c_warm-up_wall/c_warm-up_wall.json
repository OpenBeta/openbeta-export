Very important:  only use the hooks to lower the LAST climber in your party.  Please do NOT climb on top rope through the hooks. If more than one person is climbing the route, always clip your rope through your own quickdraws to the anchors.  Then, once everybody in your party has climbed the route, the last climber simply needs to clip the rope through the hooks, remove your draws, and be lowered.  (Anchor cleaning and rappelling is not best practice and is much more likely to lead to an accident.)These routes are of medium height, about 30 or so feet.  Nothing extraordinarily amazing, but good solid fun!Most of these routes dry out pretty quickly after rain. They might have a wet pocket or ledge after a rain, but are otherwise pretty consistently dry year round."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":11,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:26.804Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:02.734Z"}
