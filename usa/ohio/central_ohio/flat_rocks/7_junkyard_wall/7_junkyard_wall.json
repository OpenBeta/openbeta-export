Routes can be climbed as highball boulder problems or you can use the eye bolts installed on top to climb the routes on top rope. Note: This area has historically been a popular hangout spot and unfortunately has lots of glass at the base of routes and in some cases on top of the rock. Work is being done to clean it up, but that means you will probably encounter it while out climbing.
