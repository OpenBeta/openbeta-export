It is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 357 sq.mi. on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau. Symmes Creek rises in Bloomfield Township in southeastern Jackson County and flows generally southward through Jackson County, Gallia County, and Lawrence County, through a portion of the Ironton Unit of the Wayne National Forest and past the communities of Waterloo, Aid, and Willow Wood. It joins the Ohio River at the village of Chesapeake, opposite downtown Huntington, West Virginia. Anyway, Symmes Creek, to my knowledge, has been used in the past by greek organizations of the University of Rio Grande for initiation, and, of course, by outdoor enthusiasts. It is a beautiful area within Wayne National Forest, and needs to be treated with the respect that all of nature deserves. There are plenty of sandstone rocks to play on along the Symmes Creek Trail. Get out and play!Well, I am not sure about access issues, but if you keep driving down the road past the bridge there is a way more climbing. Huge cave on the left, looks like a good 30 feet, and beyond that there appears to be plenty of bouldering opportunities."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:26.804Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:29.747Z"}
