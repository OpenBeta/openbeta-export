The rock is often too wet for climbing so it may take some time to find a good spot to climb. Be prepared to get wet and dirty.    There is a smooth vertical section of nearly 100' in the center of the climbing area. The climbing cliff becomes smaller as you move out from the center so you can hike around the entire climbing area in about 20 minutes. I have only seen people rappelling in the middle section due to the level of difficulty, however I imagine it is climbable and it seems to allow for a moderate amount of protection due to the separation between the layers of rock. \n\n  According to the park website dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/18/… it seems that they allow aid, although they do not recommend it because of the nature of the sandstone."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:28.787Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:31.894Z"}
