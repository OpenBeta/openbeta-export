There is knobs, cracks, and a few crimps. Wall needs a lot of cleaning and chalk balling to climb effectively. There is so much potential in these walls for established climbing and bolting some of the overhangs for sport climbing. I am on vacation and don't have the time that this place deserve to put into it right now. It is a 2 wall crag. Could be multi pitched with trad gear and tree anchoring. There is a over hanging east facing wall on the east side of the crag that has some very promising climbs that NEED to be opened up. Wall gets it's name from the two Dolomedes tenebrosus (fishing spider) that was seen on the wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:17:28.517Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:05.456Z"}
