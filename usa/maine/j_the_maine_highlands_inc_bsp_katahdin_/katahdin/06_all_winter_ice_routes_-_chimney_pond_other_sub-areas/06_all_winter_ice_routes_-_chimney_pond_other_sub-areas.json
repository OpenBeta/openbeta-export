From Chimney Pond or the approach further up in the basin, Pamola IV will be the most prominent ridge in front of you to the Left of the Chimney. Look Left from Pamola IV and you will see a shorter/steeper ridge that starts about halfway up Pamola IV and then a little further Left a longer curving ridge that arcs up to the summit. That curving, low-angle ridge is Pamola III.  \n\n  To reach the ridge: Climb 600-800' of ice slabs(WI2-3) and snow/bushes diagonaling up and right, aiming for a small blocky buttress at the foot of the ridge. Several different lines can be chosen here, depending on the conditions. If avys are threatening from above safer variations with crappier climbing exist.  \n\n  Once established at the foot of the ridge, choose your own adventure up for about 1200'. The guidebook calls this mostly 4th class with a few easy 5th class moves in the summer. If you are trying to move fast but still keep the rope out it isn't practical to take the easiest line, as this would involve lots of rope drag. Making the line more direct and conducive to simul-climbing or long pitches involves some harder climbing. With crampons on and cracks filled with brittle ice we found some headwalls and boulder problems as hard as 5.7/M2. \n\n  High up on the ridge the easiest line traverses up and right for a pitch to join with the ridge on the right. Instead of the traverse there are some much harder vertical variations if you are into it and have time.  \n\n  After the jog Right one more rope-length leads to the summit shoulder and some final 3rd class moves to join the Dudley trail a couple hundred feet below the summit.","protection":"In the winter, you'll probably be trying to move fast and simul a bunch of this. If that's the case 6-8 ice screws, some small and medium nuts, and a few assorted cams should do the trick. If you're pitching it out or want more protection a full rock rack and 10-12 screws could be useful.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"931NczzTViSjF4AmVhIKhQ==","name":"The Chimney","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"W.
