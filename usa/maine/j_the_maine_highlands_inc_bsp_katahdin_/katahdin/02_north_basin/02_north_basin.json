(route description re-written 2014 from 1971 notes) Katahdins North Basin    FA / As Climbed By:   R. Hall & D. Byers, Sept. 1971 (The lower part of the route had been climbed previously, the upper may be the same as Wexler's 1946 Headwall Route.) Obviously, with todays longer ropes fewer pitches would be needed.    START: Very close to the lowest point of the North Basin, left of a vegetated ledge. See Photo.  Scramble up to a thin crack that leads to a squeeze chimney. \n\n  P1) Climb the thin crack and chimney. At the chimneys top, climb a ramp leading LEFT to the Grand Traverse Ledge.  130 ft,  5.4-5.5 \n\n  P2) Climb up into the huge corner system and up on a friction face approx. 25-30 feet left of the corner itself. Above the friction climb a jamcrack to a belay in a black dike of rock.  90 feet,  5.6-5.7 \n\n  P3) Move RIGHT 20 feet (+/-) stepping out to an airy, but not difficult, move.  Then up easily 25 feet to an inside corner.  (See NOTE.) Step LEFT back into the main corner. An awkward, off-balance 5.6-5.7 layback leads to an obvious belay on the left on some flat slabs. 90 feet,  5.6-5.7      NOTE: A resident piton ( 1971) protects a 1-inch layback crack and another A-1 piton (1971) is under a roof which leads RIGHT out of the Big Corner system.  (This leads to another route the \"Zig Zag Letdown\", also climbed by RH & DB in 1971.  The \"letdown\" of the route, whose goal was the \"Z-cracks\" in the high slab of the face, was the the slab had leaned back so far the cracks were just Class 3-4.) \n\n  P4) [Alternate?]  Move back DOWN on black rock in a corner and cross RIGHT up to a small rock-strewn ledge.  Step LEFT and up a perfect A-1 crack for three moves ( 2 nuts) then easily to a wide, flat belay on the right.  25 feet,  5.5 A-1, but probably would go free at 5.7-5.8, and could be combined with P3.   [P4 Alternate? From the slab belay at the end of P3 it may be possible to climb a flaring chimney crack and then cross to the corner mentioned as the start if P5.] \n\n  P5) Up the big corner easily on blocks and flakes for 30-40 feet  to where one can move LEFT out of the corner, make one step DOWN, then along a rising ramp to a poor belay in the middle of some slabs.  110 feet,  5.6-5.6. \n\n  P6) Move LEFT to a crack system running up the slabs.  Up this ( 5.5-5.6) to where not-difficult underhanded laybacking leads RIGHT a few feet.  Move up on left (key hold on left once committed) and then easily along a ramp 20 feet to a belay. 120 feet,  5.6 \n\n  P7) Up left along an easy ramp and slabs.  100 feet,  5.2 \n\n  P8) Directly up, climbing an inside corner or two. 150 feet,  5.2-5.3 \n\n  P9) Up, slightly on the LEFT to the top of the Serpents Head  150 feet,  5.2-5.3 \n\n  Ps 10, 11, 12, 13  Starting on the left climb up to the crest of the ridge forming the top of the cliff.  600 feet +/-  Class 4 to 5.4 depending on where you go.
