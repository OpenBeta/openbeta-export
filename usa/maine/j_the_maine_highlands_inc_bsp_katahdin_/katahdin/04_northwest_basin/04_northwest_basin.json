Follow an obvious offwidth straight up, then continue up very loose rock to a stance below the headwall. This pitch is very dangerous due to the rock quality. 5.9, 150' \n\n  5. A stair-stepped dike creates a chimney-corner system through the headwall to the top. Adequate (not great) gear. 5.6, 100' \n\n  To descend, head north along the rim to the second gully system, which is fairly wide and obvious at the top. Downclimb this, with a couple of rappels. (This gully is probably Wexler's \"Center Chimney\" route.) \n\n  This route has some really good climbing, but it's hard to recommend due to the very loose rock on the fourth pitch.
