Several routes were contributed in 2014.  Since that time Mountainproject has decided that it really should not condone and support climbing on buildings and places where it is strictly prohibited.That being said, I recently contacted the original contributor of most all of the routes (it is not clear why the contributor of the AREA did not post routes, or maybe they were deleted) who is now a climber in Colorado. With his permission I have deleted the routes he submitted, as well as one recent submission.R. Hall, MtnPrjct Admin.
