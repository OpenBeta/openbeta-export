Though there are signs of past climbing, and a few \"mystery routes\" with old hardware (which look striking!), the cliff appeared to have been largely undeveloped prior to this spring.The cliff is about 200' at it's highest point and offers a large concentration of crack climbing, with the potential for more mixed/face lines in the future. At the time of writing this, there are several new routes and many more to come. Given it's beautiful setting, quality climbing, and free camping on public land, I feel this area has the potential to become a destination in the future for climbers who enjoy going off the beaten path.\n\n The routes listed have all seen an extensive cleaning effort, but may still need some traffic before they are truly broken in.
