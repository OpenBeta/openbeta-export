This is a decent spot if your looking for something out here and want to check out the surroundings! Several tough straightforward problems present themselves, a few cracks, and also some good traversing possibilities. Sheer walls and sharp granite crystals. The hill Gets afternoon sun but is shaded well. Can be very wet. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:35.304Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:41.081Z"}
