There are six sectors, Left End, Kansas Wall, Central Wall, Ollie’s area, Moondog wall, and the Sundog Wall. As of now, there are only some of the Sundog routes listed. The cliff has many styles of climbing, from slabs, to roofs, to cracks of all sizes and most notably, excellent face climbing. The cliff is south facing and generally very warm, a good winter destination if you can get out there(road is not maintained for winter travel). Some areas seep, especially the Sundog area, where most routes will be wet in the spring, and seeps will return after heavy rain. The rock at Fletchers is excellent, and hopefully more climbers will get out here in the future. This is one of those places that doesn’t see the traffic it deserves. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:33.992Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:58.924Z"}
