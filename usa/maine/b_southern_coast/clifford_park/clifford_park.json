If you visit Clifford Park it isn't just to climb. There are designated walking / trail-running loops that total 15 miles with many more unofficial trails that are frequented by mountain bikers and wildlife. Its even possible to link trails to Smith Preserve and down to Cape Porpoise. Gorham Bike and Ski runs weekly MTB rides and can help you find new trails (facebook.com/gbssaco/)\n\n ***Clifford Park has a bad reputation for trash, broken glass, and the occasional squatter. Just be safe, pick up some trash if you can, and have a great time!\n\n ROCK HISTORY The rocks follow two main granite veins which cross the park East to West. These granite rocks were part of a multitude of quarries dating back to the 1800s. The largest collection of mines belonged to the Andrews Quarries which were most active in 1886. Biddeford granite was used in construction of the military forts near Portland, the Lincoln Monument in Illinois, and multiple bridge foundations in NYC. There is frequent quarry / mining evidence throughout the park and it makes for some fun climbing around blocky slabs of forgotten quarries. Happy exploring!\n\n THE CLIMBING The most appealing climbs with the least amount of lichen have been posted here, but if you are eager to get scrubbing or climb harder routes there are more climbs out there to find.\n\n PEAK SEASON The climbing season here is very similar to Pawtuckaway or any NE climbing. Early spring and late fall are prime to avoid the bugs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":33,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:33.996Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:59.478Z"}
