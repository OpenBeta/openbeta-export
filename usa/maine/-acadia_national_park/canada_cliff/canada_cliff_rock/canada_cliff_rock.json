Then follow cracks and ledges up a slight corner to the top of the cliff. Crux is getting through the ten feet of narrow cracks following the first ledge; after that it's pretty straightforward climbing to the top out to the right of the small tree.

The route runs more or less up the cracks/small corner to the right.\n\n To set a toprope, either scramble up the obvious gully on the right side of the area (you'll see this walking in) or walk past where the cliffs run out where you'll encounter a hiking trail.
