Because of the difficulty of the problems here and its maze like character, this area has only seen serious development over the past couple of years. Many of the possible lines are most certainly hard. Some of these projects will even boast cutting edge double-digit grades. The most aesthetic lines have the added bonus of being both tall and having bad landings.
