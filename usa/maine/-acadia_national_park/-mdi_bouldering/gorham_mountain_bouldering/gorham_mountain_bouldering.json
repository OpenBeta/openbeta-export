The bouldering in this area has historically been focused on training for Acadia’s roped pursuits. For many people the main attraction at Gorham is the 60ft long 5.12 traverse. The wall at Gorham stands about 30feet tall at its highest, which gives a nice highball character to the area’s non-traversing problems. On the tallest and cleanest section of this wall there is an unclimbed V10-11 highball project. In addition to the well-traveled cliff line bouldering at Gorham, there are also a handful of freestanding boulders scattered in the trees to the south of the main wall. These boulders hold a few easy problems and a couple of hard low-ball problems. While Gorham does not have the best rock quality in Acadia, because of its long traverse and flat landing zone, it is still a favorite training area for many locals."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:33.408Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:58.693Z"}
