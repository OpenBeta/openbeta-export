Problems here tend to have many variations. The problems in this area do not have names. This area has, for the most part, seen very little documented bouldering development. Rumor has it that one very long, very hard, problem was put up by Dave Sharratt, but this is unconfirmed. As for other lines, a number of moderate problems and a few harder variations have been climbed in the cave. There is potential for a few high-end first ascents in this area. For example, there is a very hard low-start project, which climbs into a V7/8.  This project will probably be somewhere in the V11-13 range when complete. There is also potential to do some very long very hard boulder-routes here. One such project that has been attempted links double digit boulders together to form a 60+ foot roof line. Weather and tides are a consideration here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:33.406Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:38.312Z"}
