The climbing shed is NOT OPEN for public use. In normal times there is a small, open-access bouldering shed at Witch Cliff (southern end of campus, right at the pinned location) where many locals and students climb to keep their strength up through the winter/on rainy days. Please treat the space with respect and be sure to sign the log-book hanging on the right wall as you walk in.There are also intermittent small cliffs and crags along the shoreline, easily accessed from anywhere on campus. While most of these are pretty crumbly and poorly protected with a crash pad, there are a few decent options towards the north and south ends of campus if you don't want to head all the way to Ocean Drive or Canada Cliff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:33.409Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:34.776Z"}
