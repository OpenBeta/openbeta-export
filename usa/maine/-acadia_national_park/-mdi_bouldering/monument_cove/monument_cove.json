Chris found this route by checking out horizontal crack systems that were close to the high tide mark. \"ZigZag\" offers several variations for multiple skill levels. The favorite is the sit start followed by hand jamming the crack. Bring your feet up and finish with powerful mantal moves onto the blocky and sometimes greasy granite. The ocean surf will provide the calm state of mind you need to push yourself mentally past the crux starting move.","protection":"none","location":"This route is located slightly North East of the main bouldering area at Monument Cove. Scramble up and over the overhanging cave and walk down towards the water. You will see a blocky formation with a horizontal crack system good for traverses and a vertical crack system that is great for multiple challenges. Monument Cove offers an easy and picturesque approach, some classic seaside scrambles, and oceanside bouldering with several variations to keep you busy!"},"__v":0},{"_id":"TBix6zQYXT2Gz1LNd0wOAA==","name":"Unnamed","yds":"V0-1","grades":{"yds":"V0-1","font":"4+","vscale":"V0-1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-68.19001,44.31801]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"119149860","mp_crag_id":"106112923","climb_id":"TBix6zQYXT2Gz1LNd0wOAA==","areaRef":"6pBYthk4XfGjtykSezEulw=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start on the crimps and follow the line in the picture.
