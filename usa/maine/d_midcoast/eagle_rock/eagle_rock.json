The crag stands at a height of about 12 to 15 feet. and has potential for a good boulder route or two. There is no protection as of now on the crag and very few good trees for top roping  and the crag is very short so while it may be able to be climbed it is likely to just be a better bouldering location."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:35.302Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:38.065Z"}
