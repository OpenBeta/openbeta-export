The rock is quite chossy and has lots of moss on it. The cliff has potential for a few bouldering routes or short top roping routes, max height of about 5 to 10 meters (15 to 30 feet). The cliff is nestled in a shady corner next to Mt Ararat and can get buggy in the warmer months. The rock can also stay wet for a while (two or three days) after a rain from being completely in the shade. Various trees can be used as anchors at the top of the cliff for top roping, a trail goes up either side of the cliff and are both quite visible if you know what your looking for. This cliff is good for a short local bouldering or top roping, do not go out of your way to climb here it is not much of a cliff; If you live nearby or are passing through it might make for a fun hour or two though."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:34.926Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:40.906Z"}
