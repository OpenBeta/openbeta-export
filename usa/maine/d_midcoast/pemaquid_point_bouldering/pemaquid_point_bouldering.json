Park  at the restaurant and walk left along the ocean 1/4 mile (10 min), the rock will gain height.  A Dramatic Situation follows a flake/ horizontal rightward for 10' until it is possible to mantle up.  The rock cuts away as you traverse to the right, truly exciting at high tide!!

Oceancliff bouldering similar to the Nubble, be creative. \n\n  The rock here is striated and broken yet grippy and featured.  If you're looking for a testpiece this isn't the place.  Many fourth class options and a few harder lines, a beautiful detour enroute to  Camden or Acadia; or a good place to spend a few hours if you're in the area. \n\n  There are a few problems around the lighthouse which are best visited after hours.  Otherwise, park at the restaurant and walk left along the ocean, climbing whatever tickles your fancy.
