So takeaways. If you're from this part of Maine, if you live around here, it's an interesting place to poke around. It's definitely not a destination or worth your time, and please for the love of god don't waste time trying to bolt it. Just do a top rope or two, enjoy the experience of being in a hidden little pocket of the Maine coast, and move on.\n\n Cheers!\n\n feel free to get in touch for comments or concerns: local admin"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:34.926Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:01.212Z"}
