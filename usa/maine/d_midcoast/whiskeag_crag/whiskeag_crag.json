Some might argue that these are just highball bouldering problems. A large and chossy overhanging roof of granite flakes to the left of the main wall holds potential for climbing with careful assessment of rock safety and smart protection. Climbing the roof is not advisable. Shorter bouldering lines border the main wall and roof on the cliff edges, and several large boulders plucked from the main wall are nearby options as well. A crack system tucked to the left of the roof provides another opportunity for a top roping option with tree anchors, and is an excellent practice line for learning trad placements in a safe setting.\n\n Considerations: The rock is softer granite than found in most midcoast climbing areas. Your fingers may like it, but your rope still will not. When top roping, make sure to protect the rope across the lip at the top of the wall.\n\n As of 2020, there is a rabies outbreak in bath. Avoid interacting with wildlife."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:32.953Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:57.823Z"}
