If you're prepared, you've got a couple of small nuts (to match the big ones that have gotten you this far) and/or a #1 for a few choice placements to keep you safe, as well as some mithril to ward off the trolls and giant spiders that guard the anchors. Good luck; you're gonna need it.","protection":"Bolts and small nuts (or C3s, small tcus, as in purple and blue, or blue/green aliens, but nuts are preferable), and/or #1.","location":"Just left of Looney Toons and right of the half-way bolted project, and Meltdown, consequently.

Shagg Crag has all three: steep, juggy, granite climbing. \n\n  Located about an hour away from North Conway, Shagg sees a fair amount of traffic, though it is still possible to have the crag by yourself on a sunny weekend. The crag gets afternoon sun and there is little to offer shade, so expect a warm climbing experience. This can be a great thing on sunny winter days, or a curse on sunny summer days. Get up early on warm days and climb until the wall comes into the sun. \n\n  Besides Waimea at Rumney, Shagg might be the most stacked cliff in all of New England. If you're looking for endurance-esque 5.12's, I can't think of a better crag. The guidebook lists twelve routes rated 5.12 and almost all of them are quality. Shaggin Wagon (12a), Ginseng Route (12c), Meltdown (12c/d), and Shagg It (12d), stand out as unique classics. If you're looking for routes of a more moderate grade, Shagg might offer enough for a day or so, and The Great Escape (10d) should not be missed.\n\nKayte on Shaggin Wagon"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":51,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:05:32.952Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:57.945Z"}
