You can get their two ways, either walk along the bridge until you see the big wooden staircase on the East side of the bridge or just walk around to the back side of the city hall building and cross the train tracks and you'll see a big wall made of limestone blocks. Def bring a crash pad and def bring a brush because this wall is sandy as the beach on some holds.           There are a lot of potential climbs towards the middle of the wall which none of us have been able to send (yet) Once you get towards the middle of the wall you lose the big step blocks and the challenge increases. This is also where the holds get a bit sandy so bring a brush or a plastic straw to blow out some of the sand.          It may seem sketchy climbing here because you can be seen from the city hall building and also service trucks frequent the little dirt road by the railroad tracks but we've climbed here quite a few times and have never been hassled.           THIS LIMESTONE CAN BE WAY CHOSSY so be careful. Most of the holds are pretty solid but definitely use common sense when climbing here.          One of the only actual outdoor climb spots in LFK and is a really fun spot, there is also a trash can right next to it so don't litter and also some pretty cool trails to the West.          I'll try and remember to get some more pics next time i'm in town."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:03:50.760Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:51.500Z"}
