It is primarily used for summer camps.  It is best known for its mountain biking trails but has the potential for small wall face climbing.  The facility is normally open to the pubic to visit and bike.  The staff here is very nice and the welcome center sports a bathroom and shower facility.  I happened to stumble upon the wall while exploring the area.  It looks like it may be used by a natural stage and gathering spot for the campers during the season.  I didn't have any of my gear at the time but it looks to have some potential.  There are some other areas I was told about that could be climbed but ran out of time to explore them."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:03:50.761Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:30.267Z"}
