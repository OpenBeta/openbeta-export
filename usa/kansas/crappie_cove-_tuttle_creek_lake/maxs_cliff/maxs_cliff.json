The hand holds are very solid and are mostly in the horizontal cracks that run the length of the route, but feet can be crumbly. The route was originally done on only the gray rock for extra challenge and to avoid the crumbly yellow stuff at the very bottom. No real crux, fairly solid moves and holds throughout the WHOLE 10ft! We have to work with what we got here in kansas, so no using the top or pulling off choss.","protection":"the crash zone has been nicely cleared of rocks, sticks, and bushes. You're never more than maybe a foot of the ground, but crash pads and spotters are always a good idea.","location":"Past the \"main\" area.
