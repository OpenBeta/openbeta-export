There is horizontal cracks that run the full length of the climb for tiny hand holds. Almost no feet to start with (and difficult feet to find for the remainder) and the crux is a cool cross to lieback move within the first 3 moves. We have to work with what we got around kansas, so no cheating and using the top of cliff (though, just using the top makes a nice VB warm-up) or pulling off choss for better foot holds!  \n\n  !Yemilb is the same traverse but from left to right. It is slightly more difficult because the crux is at the end when you're nicely pumped out. The moves and slightly different holds are actually a bit more interesting than the original right to left version.","protection":"The crash zone area has been nicely cleared of bushes, rocks, and sticks. Bringing a crash pad would be a good idea, though you're never more than 2 ft off the ground.","location":"On the left if walking down the old road from the parking area.
