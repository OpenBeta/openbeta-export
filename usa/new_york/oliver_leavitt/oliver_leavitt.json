Start at a bulging rock that goes up to a ledge about 12 feet up. Belay spot is directly in front of a tree. Climb up to first big ledge and work your way up a more difficult sloping rock with a good hold. once on the second ledge, get around the large ironwood tree and continue right towards a crack system. follow that crack, using the crack or faceholds for a while and the come up to the final ledge that is the end of the climb. This is the first route in the Oliver Leavitt climbing area. ","protection":"Static rope anchor system","location":"This route has only been toproped so not sure how trad would go. You will probably need at least 60 feet of static rope tied to a cedar and a large boulder at the top. If you set up the top rope between these two anchors, your anchor should fall exactly where it needs to. This climb's anchor starts at the clearing at the top of the cliff.

Most of the easily accessible climbs are to the left (facing the cliff) of the Historical site of the preacher Oliver Leavitt. The rock is pretty solid granite gneiss with interesting features and some walls around the 70-80 foot height. Very clean rock for the most part, only small sections of lichen, dirt and plants. There are a few different crack systems and some pretty featureless face climbing, and a solid diversity of other climbing as well. Towards the access trail to the top all the way to the left are some shorter and steeper climbs or even potential bouldering routes. Much more exploration is needed for these cliffs, as well as more discussion around the accessibility of the cliff. If there is any more knowledge about the area feel free to message me about it! Access to the top is very easy, but once at the top it is a bit rough as there is thick forest with many thorned trees (thorns on the trunk of tree), so be careful. There has been a small trail lightly blazed, but still rough going. Once through the thicker forest, the cliff access opens up to open cliff top with a few scattered trees and rocks for anchors on toprope. So far this area has only been toproped. If you do come, please do not bolt as we do not yet know the accessibility issues."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:08.748Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:44.655Z"}
