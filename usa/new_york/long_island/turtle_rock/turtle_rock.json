This area consists of one large glacial erratic, Turtle Rock, nestled in the Pine Barrens. Unfortunately, high school kids have also discovered this spot and there is a lot of broken glass and graffiti on the boulder. However, if you live close by or want to stop by on your way to Wildwood State Park, there are some problems on this fairly large hunk of granite. Most sides are slabby, however there are some v0-v1 sit starts on the vertical and overhanging parts of the boulder. Maybe 10 feet tall at its highest. The positives are that it's an easy hike from the road and it has no access issues as this is a 400 acre state preserve. The drawbacks are that it is short and most of the climbs are low quality. You can see this boulder pretty clearly if you check out the area on Google Earth."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:10.073Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:32.373Z"}
