The access is quite easy from Penny's Road, but unfortunately it's a private road making that option not viable. (However, there is a really sweet and expensive Airbnb located mere steps from the boulder if you're looking to splurge a bit.) While I doubt that many will make the trek out here, this boulder is surprisingly large and is the biggest boulder on this entire stretch of coastline. That being said, most of the climbs are in the v0-v1 range and most sides of the boulder are slabby/vertical and well featured. But, if you're looking for something well off the beaten path, this could be the block for you. As with most of the Roanoke Avenue boulders, these climbs can be done without a pad, which helps to lighten your load for the long trek. This boulder is only climbable within a few hours of low tide. At high tide, the boulder is under water. There are other boulders located on the beach east of here, but I haven't explored them enough to attest to their quality."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:10.530Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:33.512Z"}
