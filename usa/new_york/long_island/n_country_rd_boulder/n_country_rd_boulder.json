Could use thorn bush trimming, and wire brushing on rock. Checked it out today and looks like a lot of potential. Even if the only side cleaned is the side that's hidden from the main road. Quick 10 min walk from the Split Rock parking spot. Boulder is tall. I'm 5.8 and the bottom of the graffitied smiley face was higher than me. I have no doubt this spot would be covered in ticks in the warmer temps. Anyone know first assents?If you look to the opposite side of the road.. Those woods far expand up and over the hills and follow the powerlines that comes from split rock/nuke power plant area. I've walked much of those bike paths in there and only found one small 8ish ft tall boulder with a v0 climb that isn't worth walking in there for. So you don't need to explore in there. There's nothing in there. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:10.074Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:31.907Z"}
