One side has basically no feet but a great crack that's deep enough to do a crimp traverse, and linking it into the other side. Then the other side has a few solid crimps. The arete has a perfect pocket that I found myself starting my climbs from. I mean obviously if you wanted to do a full day of climbing you would just go to Split Rock or Wildwood. For a bored local or if you’re curious.As always watch for ticks."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:10.076Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:46.978Z"}
