This boulder has a nice arete with a small overhang that makes for a fun top out. You can start really low. Really just something for a bored local or someone curious. \n\n  Arthur Kunz County Park features tidal creeks, a lush, mixed deciduous forest, rolling hills and valleys, and quaint hidden ponds all of which provide important habitat for wildlife. The trail system in the park provides a scenic link in a section of the Long Island Greenbelt Trail which heads north from Arthur Kunz Park to its terminus at Sunken Meadow State Park."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:10.074Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:46.891Z"}
