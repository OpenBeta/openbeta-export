Crash pads and spotters are necessary to protect the 20 foot falls. Inspecting the top-out isn't a bad idea. Make sure to choose the right time of day because the road is almost always busy with runners, bikers, and cars, even during the colder months. This boulder doesn't see a lot of action because of its \"highball\" status and difficult routes, so cleaning the holds and top-out will likely be necessary. It also seems to have a few overhung boulders to the right and left of it with potential for lines with cleaning."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:11.116Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:48.081Z"}
