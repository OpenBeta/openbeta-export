Short and sweet problems: four or five moves on sharp holds, followed by generally easy topouts. Most problems start from sit-starts though, and sometimes getting off of the ground can be the hardest part. Admittedly, the grades sometimes make more sense after spending an hour and a half puzzling over the beta, but good luck convincing yourself that the crimpy overhung arete is a V1... \n\n  This boulder is awesome for when you have an hour or two to yourself, with no spotter or crashpad.
