The station is on the western border of the park. Alternatively, can drive and park alongside Broadway on the western border of VCP.Either way, the best rock appears to be west of Mosholu Parkway / I-87 (Major Deegan Exp) and north of the Henry Hudson Parkway divide. GPS location maps to the NYC Parks Restroom and Annex as a central location for trails to access known and future routes. Areas north of Van Courtland Lake tend to be swampy or inaccessible; however, there's probably room to explore along the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail. The southern parts of the park are more recreational with playgrounds, pool, and sports facilities, while the southeast has open terrain."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:08.751Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:14.102Z"}
