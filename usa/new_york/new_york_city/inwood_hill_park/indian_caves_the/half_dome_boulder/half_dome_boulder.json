I'm guessing it to be about V6 ish but as my max grade is v3 that could be off. The climb starts with a crouch start where the rock is dirty and has a crack running through it, and then follows on Â slopers and rises up on some more slopers. Once you reach the flat part of the arete continue traversing with easier movement to a hard topout right before the arete is about to go down again. Make sure to bring a brush for cleaning as I wasn't able to clean the entirety of the route (but I was able to clean most of it.)If you climb this, please comment down below what grade you think it is and what you thought of the climb.
