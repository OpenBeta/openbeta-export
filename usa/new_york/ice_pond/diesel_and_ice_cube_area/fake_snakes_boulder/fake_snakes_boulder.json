Off the same starting jug, move up to the rail rather than staying low. (So you’ll be have hands and feet above the lip from the get-go, which you will not on Fake Snakes.) Don’t top out straight up — traverse all the way to the obvious horn jug on the far right and top out there (same as Fake Snakes). I’ve heard V0, but I'll disagree on that — unless I completely missed some magical jug in the middle that makes this trivial. There’s a reasonable span off a sloper that a V1 climber would still have some difficulty with. And, now I think about it, the topout is probably a bit more than V0 too, even though it’s juggy.NOTE: other guide says this is called \"Earthworms\" and I was told that that name is incorrect.","protection":"Couple pads, or just step off if you think you might fall","location":"Exactly where Fake Snakes is, using all the same holds plus a few extras"},"__v":0},{"_id":"DKRzowmJW7CxcUYQN3+Bgg==","name":"Fake Snakes","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.62149,41.45111]},"left_right_index":17,"mp_id":"117967146","mp_crag_id":"121120615","climb_id":"DKRzowmJW7CxcUYQN3+Bgg==","areaRef":"G0MBTvNKXfethNPiIMs9QA=="},"content":{"description":"Overhung with gym-like holds.
