Table Rock is a great place to get a view of the entire city of Oneonta, NY. The climbing is very undeveloped, but there are many spots that could have boulder problems waiting to be discovered. The most developed spot is a 5-10 min walk along the loop but if you work your way back toward the entry you can find many highball overhangs and long traverses on fairly solid rock with smaller more accessible climbs scattered in. Many spots are very chossy so avoid areas that might be damaged by climbing. When you finish for the day make sure to visit Yellow Deli and be on the lookout for frisbees carrying its name and the promise of a free meal!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:06.836Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:11.706Z"}
