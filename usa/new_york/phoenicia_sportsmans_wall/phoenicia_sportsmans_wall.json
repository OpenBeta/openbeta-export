The wall hosts about 10 fun, well bolted, moderate (from 5.8-5.12) sport routes on sandstone.  At one time the cliffs were part of the local quarrying industry, but have been abandoned since the early 1900's.  Many of the bolts have been painted to blend in with the rock.  You may need to look closely to find the start of some routes.   The routes vary from short with massive overhangs to slopey.  As with any sandstone some of the holds can be crumbly, but most are on quality rock.   The Sportsman's Wall is in a beautiful forest setting occasionally visited by black bears (don't pet them) with great views from the tops of the pitches.  Bolted anchors at the tops of the climbs. Many of the anchors require re-threading at the chains.  Be sure you understand this procedure before you climb, or plan to leave 2 biners.   You may be able to top rope harder routes by leading easier ones nearby, but attempting to reach the anchors from above is not recommended.    Before you climb do not miss the pancakes at Sweet Sues!  (Update: Sweet Sues is re-opening soon, in the meantime try the Phoenicia Diner or Brios for breakfast.)  The Sportsman's Alamo Cantina is great for burgers, burritos and beer outside after your climb.  Mamas Boy has good coffee and snacks.  There is also a little grocery store that sells beer etc, and several campgrounds."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":12,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:08.747Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:13.995Z"}
