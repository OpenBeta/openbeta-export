The one bright spot for climbers living in the Syracuse area.  Officially designated a NY State DEC Unique area, ice climbing is allowed down stream from the main falls area.  The main falls might look tempting but climbing is forbidden.  The Upper Gorge and Amphitheater offer the majority of the climbs in the area are are easily accessible by hiking along the lip of the gorge and rapping in.   \n\n  When the winters are cold the ice comes in fat, when the winters are mild the ice is pretty sketchy to non-existent.  It takes a while for the ice to come in, climbing starts getting good in February unless it has been an especially cold year.  The area offers a mix of top rope and lead opportunities from WI3 to WI6 including Mixed routes.  Get there early, as the most popular climbs fill up fast. \n\n  Jim Lawyer's Salmon River Guide (Updated December 2016) is the quintessential resource.  All of the routes at Salmon River falls have a fish theme, most of them involving Salmon. \n\nNEIce is the best resource for current conditions."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:08.747Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:13.917Z"}
