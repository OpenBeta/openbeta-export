Moss on the face of some areas can contribute to bad foot smears. This particular route was fun because it was risky due to no protection for first 25 feet or so. *Dont skip the last Boulder at the top, best part*  you can finish by clearing left at top before final 15 feet, but the boulder adds to elevation of climb and requires tricky moves.  Also note, the back tree at top of route is not a single rope Rappel and retrieval. I made this mistake. Being that i solo climb and need a double length to clear my route, I got stuck and had to self rescue on my protected line off a small tree in the middle of the route. YAY.  The rappel tree is to the left of the route.","protection":"The first 40 feet of the route only has one possible placement for protection that i could find for a Nut, after that cams and Nuts.
