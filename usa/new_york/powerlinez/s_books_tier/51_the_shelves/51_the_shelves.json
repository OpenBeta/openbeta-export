But ...    if each climber is lowered on the rope after climbing up, there will be significant abrasion of the rope from it running over the edges of the ledges.

Except this sector modifies that scheme to base the names on a significant European book. So the idea is to use actions or characters or quotes from a significant book of Europe (including the UK), but without actually giving the title or author. Usually you can find the name of the book by doing a web search on the route name, or names from multiple routes side-by-side, or perhaps together with a hint from the Description of the route. \n\nwarning: The rock around this sector has not been climbed much yet, and much of the rock is still breakable and loose -- so the belayer and other people should stand far away from underneath the climber. \n\n  . . .
