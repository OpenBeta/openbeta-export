Above from The Shelves sector.   Faces mainly SSW. \n\nTop Rope access: Simple (but not short) way to reach top of this wall is to hike uphill Right (ENE) on wide ledge until just past the top of \"Call Me Ishmael\" and \"Harpoon Me\" route of The Good Book. Then turn sharp Left and walk along the top roughly W for a ways. \n\n  For climbs near the left end, for climbers with sufficient skill, it might be quicker to (carefully) climb up the route \"Left Bracket\". \n\nnames of routes: The names follow the approach of the names near the adjacent left end of The Good Book wall, which come from the great American novel, Moby Dick, by Herman Melville. So the idea is to use actions or characters or quotes from a significant American book, but without actually giving the title or author - (except two of the names are from a great book of Finland bacause the first ascender of those routes was visiting from Finland). Usually you can find the name of the book by doing a web search on the route name, perhaps together with a hint from the Description of the route. \n\nwarning: The rock around this sector has not been climbed much yet, and much of the rock is still breakable and loose -- so the belayer and other people should stand far away from underneath the climber. \n\n  . . .
