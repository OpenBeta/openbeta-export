The rocks are close together, making it easy for climbers to get on different boulders. Tree cover provides a lot of shade, however, the sun still manages to peek through and thus, the area is well lit. Being at the entrance, especially just off the road, you're likely to see some other climbers or quads/dirtbikes travelling the road (a little more rare). \n\n  The rock is similar to the rest of the rock contained in the Powerlinez. It's a bit rough with some sharp edges and nice cracks. This leads to great, strong holds and encourages interesting moves. These rocks provide you with several route options: highballs, cracks, traverses, etc.  \n\n  Overall, this is a great place to warm up or hang out if the threat of rain is present. At the same time, it is definitely worth spending a day on just exploring what the road has to offer."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:10.529Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:47.293Z"}
