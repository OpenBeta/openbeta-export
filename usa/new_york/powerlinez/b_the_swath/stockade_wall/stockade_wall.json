Has a tendency to get overgrown with thorns and bramble, but herd paths tend to keep the bramble at bay. Due to it's SE facing aspect and lack of tree cover, this makes for a great winter climbing spot.  \n\n  Rock is generally good - sharp and gritty Powerlinez rock. The left side has harder climbs with some project while the right side lends itself to easier climbs including some 5.easy ramps to the far right. There is potential for a couple more routes to be squeezed in, especially on the far left side. If you have put up a new route please be sure to post it to the Powerlinez - Beta Shed facebook group for the community. That is where the most active development is happening.  \n\n  Setting up Top Ropes on this wall can be tricky. Gear placements at the top are usually in cracks at your feet, causing un-needed wear on cams. Tricams work well. You could use a long static and gear on some of the walls behind the Stockade wall, but chances are you'll have to do battle with some thorn bushes to get access to those cracks. There is a large boulder available to wrap a loop around, but as with any large stone, please check it's integrity.  \n\n  Once you do get a rope set up, these climbs are stellar and deserve more traffic."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:09.681Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:31.637Z"}
