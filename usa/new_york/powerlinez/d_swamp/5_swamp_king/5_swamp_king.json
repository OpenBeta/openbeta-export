Go there when you're sure it's dry, otherwise the base would likely be \"swampy\". \n\n  Top of the less-than-vertical wall has a nice well-defined edge for setting up top-ropes, but not many Trad gear placements near that edge, so best to have a long static line (50 feet / 15 meters) for most of the routes. \n\n  Many potential holds have moss on them or nearby, so might want to bring a brush or other tools for cleaning -- but lots of fun interesting moves even as it is (in 2014)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:09.681Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:31.902Z"}
