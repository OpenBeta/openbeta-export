Please make certain to place several directionals on the route if you TR it; the route goes off at a good angle, and the potential pendulum isn't pleasant.  Gear-only anchor.","location":"As you approach the Big Slab/Compactor area, you'll notice the alcove directly ahead and a large slab on the left.  Slant Crack is on the left wall, just before the alcove; follow the diagonal crack to top, step out and around to the face, straight to top.
