On the right is a left-facing corner leading up to a small roof - you traverse left under the roof to the offwidth crack (5.7 and reasonably protected).

This is 5.7 and scary but a good spot will keep you safe.   \n\n  In either case, attack the offwidth above.  At a horizontal you can either traverse right out of the crack and climb the face or be like Fritz and power up the offwidth.  Both of these are about 5.7.

From there you can spot the next belay: at an awkward rap station near questionable blocks on Yellow Belly.

After the piton, I continued left to a small horizontal (BD #00 and #000) below the ceiling. There are good high feet and good low hands but I couldn't figure it out and had to use 3 points of aid (including a sketchy #00 in poor rock that left me hanging by one lobe and another #00 that later pulled when my partner fell following the pitch) to get to a key \"jug\" and gear placement just right of the Alphonse corner and directly across from the foot crack of Alphonse's leftward traverse. This is the crux of the route and Dick Williams's guidebook clocks it at 5.9-. After studying the limited available beta in print I think that I missed a key horizontal about 10' down from the piton for feet. Would love to hear from others about their experiences with this pitch.

Step down and left to slanting horizontals and make long step to a slab. Up the slab and left to a horizontal with many small flakes (careful what you pull on here). Move about 12' left and downclimb (follower risks a shitty fall here) just past the lichen to a ledge system. Move left to a tat belay on Baskerville.   \n\n  Pitch 9 5.3 G, 120':   Diagonal up and left to a pin and then continue left following the path of least resistance for about 60' past chain anchor to where it seems convenient to diagonal down and left onto a ramp/slab.

Broken Sling starts at a left-facing arete just under a right-facing corner and roof. \n\n  P1: Locate an obvious boulder problem just right of a low roof.  A large jug about 10' up dares you to grab it.  The moves up through this are surprisingly tricky - you're definitely risking a twisted ankle or worse.  You can protect with a cam on the left (tough to place) or just go for it and place a piece from the big jug.  Borrow a crash pad or bring a beefy spotter.  Once your feet are on the jug all is well, but there's a lot more climbing ahead. \n\n  Above, move up to a small roof, turn it on the left, then climb up meandering towards a large alcove with a fixed anchor.  Belay here to avoid rope drag. 5.8+, 75'. \n\n  P2: Climb out right of the alcove.  A pin that once protected the traverse is gone now, so this part is hard to protect.  You can make a long reach straight up if you're tall, or, as most people do, quake right, up, and left on minimal pro to easier ground.  A bit more climbing leads to the top. 5.8 PG, 65'. \n\n  ...More details on P2 from Kurtz:  Belay on a small ledge 15 ft below the rap anchor (it's a better stance).  The first moves up a hollow flake aren't hard or scary but the pro is suspect until you can sling the anchor webbing (V2).  Traverse right (20+ ft) until you find enough holds to move up to the overhang. Then traverse all the way back left on good hands but minimal feet until you are beneath a weakness in the roof. Set a bomber piece here and go! Easier climbing above, to the clifftop. \n\n  V2: From the rap anchor at the start of P2, go straight up the flaring crack through an overhang (5.9+ PG).  This avoids the traverses on the regular route. \n\n  Walk along the cliff to climbers' right, then before the road, scramble back down to the cliff base.","protection":"Standad Gunks rack to a #3 camalot.
