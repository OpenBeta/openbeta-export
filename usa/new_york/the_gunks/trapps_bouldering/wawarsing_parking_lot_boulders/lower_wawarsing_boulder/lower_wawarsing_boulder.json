Because of this, I don't have any information on problem names or first ascents.  Please inform me if I've turfed over someone's FA.  It's a matter of a lack of knowledge rather than a lack of respect. \n\n  Located in a nice bit of forest and well protected from car noise, the Lower Wawarsing boulder has a great concentration of varied V0 problems. That makes it a great warm-up/cool-down spot, and a great place for beginners to be challenged while having a taste of success to make them want to come back for more (a great place to introduce a girlfriend or boyfriend to bouldering).  The starts or top-outs are typically the most difficult aspects of these problems, so it's easy to eliminate crux or scary moves for beginners while maintaining the flow of the problem."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:11.556Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:36.820Z","_change":{"user":"jhoZ1HM5QQCLlIW8x9mK3A==","historyId":"65b168c37fb5d7edf057afbd","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
