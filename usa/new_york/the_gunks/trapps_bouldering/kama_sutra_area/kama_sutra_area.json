I guess the dead give away should have been that Frog's Head, Kama Sutra and Maria were on the cliff face 75 feet left of me, but the route description matched the traverse so well.  \"Start on edges just to the right of the dihedral.  Traverse the technical slab to the right.  Passing under a bulge, moving across a thin vertical seam and completing the very long problem at an arete near a tree.\"  This works for either problem.  Anyway, it goes at least one V-grade easier than its namesake, but there's some good technical edge grabbing and thin foot work that make this problem well worth your time.
