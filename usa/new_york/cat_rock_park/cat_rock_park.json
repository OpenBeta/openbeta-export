The Western edge of the park which abuts Bedford-Banksville Rd (rt 56) hosts the majority of the bouldering. There's some really great highball and lowball problems scattered along this hill side. Many great climbers have honed their skills here, including a trip by Sharma bitd. \n\n  The entire hill side East of Banksville Road is OWNED by the town. The below images prove that so don't let anyone from the nursery try to tell you otherwise. They used to tell us they owned the land but that's not true, per the town tax maps."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:11.120Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:33.689Z"}
