Climbers will find excellent moderate to difficult ice lines and mixed climbing routes. The Kitchen is only one of several closely situated ice/rock bands, but generally they are separate areas that are best accessed via a different approaches. As you descend past the Kitchen, you will find Bridalveil Falls on the right side, above which is Plattekill Falls and further down the ravine is Japanese Falls. Above these waterfalls, higher on the walls of the ravine, are found the Light Side and the Dark Side areas. Named based on the amount of sun they get on a normal winter day, the Light Side comes in rarely and goes out quickly. The Dark SIde has both upper and lower sections which have become decidedly more popular in recent years as the number of climbers has increased.
