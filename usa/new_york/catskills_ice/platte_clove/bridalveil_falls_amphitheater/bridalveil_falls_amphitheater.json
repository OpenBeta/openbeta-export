In the winter, this easily accessible amphitheater has a variety of different single pitch ice and mixed routes. The wall left and right of Bridalveil hold several harder mixed routes. Most climbers know only of Bridalveil Falls, but there are other lesser known classics that face north, form early, climb thin ice and mixed terrain and have adequate gear."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.789Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:21.189Z"}
