Some of the hangers here are unstable in sunny or warm weather, and these routes should be approached cautiously. Additionally, the rock quality on this side isn’t great and climbers should not attempt the mixed climbing here unless it’s been cold and the ground is frozen solid. Only fools climb here when it’s warm."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.791Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:19.916Z"}
