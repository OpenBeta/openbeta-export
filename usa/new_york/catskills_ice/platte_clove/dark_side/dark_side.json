The name the Dark Side comes from its north facing aspect. The area has both an upper and lower section. There are very attractive moderate ice falls, some mixed lines in leaner conditions, and some more exciting variety in fatter conditions. Most routes are less than half a rope length."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.789Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:36.650Z"}
