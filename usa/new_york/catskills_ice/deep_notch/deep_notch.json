I don't think you can top rope them as I don't know any walk around trails.  Most routes are between grade 2 to 3+.  Check \"An Ice Climber's Guide to the Catskill Mountains\" for more details. \n\n  One thing new leaders should be aware of is that a lot of the top outs are dirt and rock unless it's a really good year.  This means the last two to three moves can be very dicey, scratching on rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.282Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:19.660Z"}
