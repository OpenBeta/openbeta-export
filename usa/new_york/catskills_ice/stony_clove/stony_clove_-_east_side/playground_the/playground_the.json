It's a favorite with guide services, who bring groups of beginners here.  The approach, while strenuous, isn't as bad as other areas of the Clove.  There are at least 4-5 distinct lines, with options for others; the area can only hold 3-4 ropes, though, before things get too crowded. \n\n  You don't need to lead to climb here; you can either solo up the easy gully on the left (WI2-) or walk around to the right, past Twin Columns and Sun Wall, to an obvious walk-up.  Bring plenty of static line for anchoring off the trees at the top."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.794Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:36.890Z"}
