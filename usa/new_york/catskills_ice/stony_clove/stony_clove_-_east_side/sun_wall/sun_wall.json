There are a few good trees at the top for anchors, but bring static line or webbing - they're set a bit back.  This wall gets a LOT of sun, so it stays fairly warm - if there's no wind.  Also, because of the plentiful sun, this is the first section to get baked out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.794Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:20.030Z"}
