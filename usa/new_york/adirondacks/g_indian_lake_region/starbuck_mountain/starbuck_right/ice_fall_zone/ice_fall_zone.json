The route runs through the chimney of the ice route Cool Beans, so it requires long dry spells to be worth climbing.   Flotsam tends to lodge in the cracks and chimney, remnants of ice season.   The chimney looks heinous, but holds on both walls eliminate almost all of the standard groveling expected in this type of climbing.   Scramble up and left over easy steps to a stance below the chimney, then work up into and through it. Continue up the easy slab above (cleanest rock is on the outside edge of the right-facing corner).","protection":"Big Cams, applied in sequence: C4s: #1, 2, 3, 4, 5, & 6.","location":"This is the big hanging chimney just left of the access ramp leading to the Ledge."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,589a474a-bbce-5213-a77d-8138a22e0474,21c0dcef-75a2-5517-93ef-0026142ec2a0,46a9d056-dd4c-575c-9f80-7546d6fefe1e,17c762f6-f528-538f-b0b3-a86527dfa2b2,0618e8ba-af6a-5d43-b68a-625a82ad1afc,a027866c-5ccd-5afc-8fa2-7147248143d4","pathTokens":["USA","New York","Adirondacks","G: Indian Lake Region","Starbuck Mountain","Starbuck Right","Ice Fall Zone"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.0946,43.77311]},"bbox":[-74.09522272473666,43.77266033981814,-74.09397727526336,43.77355966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109430919","area_id":"oCeGbFzNWvyPonFHJIFD1A=="},"content":{"description":"This is the often-wet, dank area bordered by the Left Slab on the left and the Ledge area on the right.
