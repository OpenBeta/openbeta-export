Climb the tower, following a line that includes two oddly placed (are both necessary?) pitons midway up. \n\n  The are no anchors, so you must build a gear anchor for the belay and it would be easiest to downclimb the tower (5.1).  We did manage to wrap the rope around the top most horn/highest point of rock, then move an end far left to reduce the drag enough to pull the rope after rappelling.","protection":"Trad, a few pitons. \n\n  The first piton is manky.
