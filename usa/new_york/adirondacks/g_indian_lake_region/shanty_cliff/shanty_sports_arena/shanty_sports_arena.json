Layback while smearing through the crux to a small ledge. From the ledge, turn left, step up into the left most crack and foot traverse up to the summit slab. Remember to protect your second on this climb at the bottom and at the top. Belay from trees or build a gear anchor in the slab.","protection":"Small cams (up to .75 camalot), medium nuts. The crux and upper crack can take hand/fist sized cams.
