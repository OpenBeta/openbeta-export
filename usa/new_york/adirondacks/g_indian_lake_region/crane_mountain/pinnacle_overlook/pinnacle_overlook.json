Climb this to its end, bump to a good horizontal. Make a difficult mantle to stand on this (crux), then shift left to place gear under the flap above (green C3). Tenuous friction moves gradually ease as you pass a bolt and head for the anchor.   It isn't a long route, but it manages to pack a lot of variety anyway. The gear is good, but definitely requires an experienced hand at getting good placements - and a cool head, since the crux move is made with gear at your feet.","protection":"Full set of C3s, a .5 C4 may come in handy, & some largish brass nuts; offsets work best.
