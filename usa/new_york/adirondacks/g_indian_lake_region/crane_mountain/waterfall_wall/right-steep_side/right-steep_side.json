It is well worth climbing the entire route for those who lead at this difficulty, or of course to access the anchors of harder routes to the right.   Step out from the top of the foot ramp, traversing straight right to a crack in the base of a left-facing corner, at the point where the slab drops off into the steep face below. Climb up around the corner to a vertical crack just left of the anchors of I'll Fly Away, then climb up to a horizontal crack, above which the vertical crack closes up. Traverse right to another vertical crack, then climb up to a ledge and belay at an oak tree to climber's right. The climbing to this point is 5.5 G.

This route is an open invitation to free up, probably lodging in at 5.11.   Climb up the ramp-like corner (scary committing start, don't fall here!), snuggle in an excellent #1 C4, then move up and slightly left to reach a thin crack facing downward short of the lip of the ceiling. Follow this crack rightward, using opposed brass nuts (very important!) and C3s, to a step up, where the crack becomes wide. Reach above the overhang and hit a good 1\" vertical crack to break through it, then continue up steep but bomber vertical crack to its end. Swing right to another vertical crack, which also peters out, but reemerges 7' higher. Make a couple free moves to cross the gap, then continue up easing angle rock to a tree on the left.   Originally done as a solo aid route, I took my first real leader-aid fall on this, when a brass nut I hadn't opposed pulled as I swung rightward.
