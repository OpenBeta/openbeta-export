Start on top of boulders beneath an inverted \"V\" notch. Step right under the initial overhang, use the left-leaning crack of the notch to get over that obstacle, then continue up and left along the crack/ramp to a right-facing corner. Go up the corner 15', passing a couple optional cracks on the left, to the point where the main wall sweeps up vertically. There's a left-rising diagonal crack at this point; take it around onto the outside edge of the corner. Climb that outside edge to the top.","protection":"Standard Adk. Rack.","location":"From Crane's true summit (where the Survey Disc is), walk west along the ridge (away from the ladder) about 200 yards. Look for a point where the trail passes beside a prominence that is *not* the edge of the main cliff; it is a 20' high outcrop with a small patch of woods tucked between its base and the top of the main cliff beyond. There is a fire ring nestled in this patch of trees (hence the area's original name). The top of Thank You, Cindy lies directly below about the center of the outcrop by the trail. It is possible to rap down off a tree to its base.   If coming in from the bottom, leave the hiking trail at the last bench below the big ladder (a 25' tall ladder), hiking through the woods westward for about 300 yards. After passing a steep notch below, head steeply up to the cliff. Look for the face with several left-leaning cracks in it. This route begins on top of blocks right of the low point of this cliff, and left of the most clear area, which is along the cliff base's right end.   Descent is best by rappel - or bring your gear up with you and hit the trail from the top."},"__v":0},{"_id":"jZtWFvcNUcOOs5YL0Hvl/Q==","name":"Original Exploit","yds":"5.9-","grades":{"yds":"5.9-","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9677,43.5378]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106749370","mp_crag_id":"106749362","climb_id":"jZtWFvcNUcOOs5YL0Hvl/Q==","areaRef":"HBEilMsEWsyaPEcwEkWeBA=="},"content":{"description":"The crux is getting up the overhanging wall after leaving the flake.
