It starts in a corner which opens up to an arete.  Moving right off of the arete is the crux.  Once past here, head up, migrating right, over some small trees, eventually leading to a crack below an overhang.  Climb to the overhang, escape left, up and over the ledge to the top.","protection":"Protection is good.  Mid-sized cams and medium-small nuts should get the job done.  Medium length slings are also good to reduce rope drag.","location":"Described in the new Adirondack guidebook as 2 pitches, it may be more desirable to do it as one.  Rappel off of the end of Pond View Slab, about where the slab curves to face the pond.  Belay off this \"corner.\" \n\n  Stop at the ledge, pull down your rope, and let the fun begin.
