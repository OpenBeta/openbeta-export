The original ascent climbed all the way to the top, through questionable rock, poor protection, and damp sections. \n\n  NOTE: A lot of ice forms over the lip of the Birthday Corner early in the season. It falls from >30m up, landing among the base of all the Amphitheatre area routes. Even after the main winter's accumulation has fallen, nightly formations continue to bombard the area. Be watchful, wear a helmet, and if big ice is looming above on that crystalline spring morning, maybe climb somewhere else.","protection":"Full set of cams from tiny to #3 C4; small tricams, a nut or two.   There is now a 2-bolt anchor at 70'; the rock above this is crumbly and dirty, so most climbers opt to finish the pitch here. These anchors also make it easy to TR neighboring routes.","location":"The Amphitheatre is the set-back section of cliff, about 100 yards wide, between the Isobuttress and the Tripe Buttress.
