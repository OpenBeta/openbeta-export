The rock above seemed nicely featured, but rather devoid of anything that looked promising for protection. Accordingly I/we backed off, using a horn on a large flake 20-25 ft to the right.  \n\n  The route continues to look like excellent rock from photographs. It's \"open\" to anyone. \n\n  The buttress we rapped down produced a couple of nice 5.6 5.7 TR routes.  \n\n  START - about 50-80? feet Left of the vegetated ramp leading to the Goodwin-Eastman route, on a minor height-of-land no more than a hillock with tall grass. The vegetated ramp with the minor hillock to the left, and the overlap that marks the highest we reached, show clearly in the photo of Porter in Adirondack Rock.   \n\n  P1 - Climb a weathered crack (P1 crux 5.8 PG-13, R?) to easier climbing up to a small overlap with great gear (Yellow Alien, if memory is correct). This was our high point.  \n\n  P2 & 3 - Is all yours !","protection":"Usual rack","location":"START: Left of the vegetated ramp leading to Goodwin-Eastman."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,589a474a-bbce-5213-a77d-8138a22e0474,21c0dcef-75a2-5517-93ef-0026142ec2a0,2355ce0f-6bd8-5f66-a1cc-7002c38ea4a4,aba654ba-793f-5a46-b652-74a2d17f300b","pathTokens":["USA","New York","Adirondacks","E: High Peaks Region","Porter Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.82766,44.20778]},"bbox":[-73.82828730215621,44.20733033981814,-73.82703269784378,44.20822966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111991573","area_id":"q6ZUunk/Wka2UnSi0X8wCw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-73.82828730215621,44.20733033981814],[-73.82703269784378,44.20733033981814],[-73.82703269784378,44.20822966018186],[-73.82828730215621,44.20822966018186],[-73.82828730215621,44.20733033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the big face so easily seen from the parking lot of the Noonmark Diner, and from many other places in Keene Valley.  \n\n  Definitely a \"wilderness outing\", it is less committing than, for example, Wallface but still deserves respect.  \n\nAdirondack Rock (Lawyer & Haas) lists several routes here, including the historic 1935 \"Goodwin-Stanley\"."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:03.894Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:08.248Z"}
