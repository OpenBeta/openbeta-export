Lawyer's description of Mental Blocks can be found on pg. 461 of Volume 1. \n\n  Long day so get up early.  Plan 2-3 hours from car - base of climb, this face roasts in the sun so if you're doing it in the summer the earlier you can start the better.   \n\n  P1: When you arrive at the base of the route you'll look up and see the easily identified 'Lightning-bolt crack.'  There will be some small cedars encountered along the way, so it's somewhat a tree-fight on your way up.  5.7, 140' \n\n  P2: Beautiful corner into a large roof.

Climbing felt secure (much more featured and secure than 'Thanksgiving' 5.7X pitch as a comparison).  Belay in the corner at a thin seam.  From this belay you will be at the height of the gorgeous overhanging fist crack on your left. 5.7 PG-13 60' (Lawyer guidebook says this is an R-rated pitch, felt more like PG-13).   \n\n  (P3/P4 can be easily linked, this is the 'typical' way of doing this climb.

Belay immediately after pulling over and onto a small ledge when you reach a thin crack. Looking right of your shoulder you'll start drooling over the next pitch of beautiful hands/fists that goes up and to the right.  5.12a, C1, 40' \n\n  P6 (P5 if you link 3/4): follow the crack that goes up and right until you reach the tat for the pendulum! Lower about 15' below the tat, (or insecure down climb) and make a 20' swing to the crack system on climbers right.  Ascend the corner and belay on a sloping ledge above where your second will land when he completes the pendulum.   \n\n  NOTE: Belaying above the end of the pendulum makes it easy to lower a bight of rope for your second to clip into after the second completes the swing (as they'll have to untie and pull the rope from the pendulum anchor before continuing) 5.8 G, A0, 50' \n\n  P7 (P6 if you link 3/4): Make a run for the top on the steep and crisp jams and secure face climbing until you make it to the trees.

Full disclaimer: I only climbed to the top of the 4th pitch; the pitches above were wet and there was a Peregrine Nest on the 5th pitch ledge. If someone who has done the full route wants to take over this page, feel free. I just wanted to add it because its such an awesome route. \n\n  Pitch 1. 11a 70ft.    -Climb up the right facing corner with 10a-ish stemming until you can clip the bolt. Bust left on crimps (crux) until you can pull around the arete. Climb the face (protect with small cam) up to the ledge and belay. Can be linked with the next pitch. The grade seemed right for the crux but the pitch was very accessible at the grade, because the hard climbing is brief and bolt protected. I had more trouble on the sandbagged second pitch. \n\n  Pitch 2. 10a (sandbag) 100ft.   -Climb the obvious thin crack over two tricky overlaps. The first one felt 5.9-10a, but the second one felt sandbagged to me unless I was missing something. I had more trouble on it than the crux of the first pitch. Place a small cam, grab the good fingerlock, reach up to the crimp, and pull over the overlap onto the slab, pinching the edge of a small left facing corner. The crack was wet in parts when I did it, but the wet bits didn't seem like they'd be good holds anyway. After this bulge continue of the easy offwidth above and belay at a two bolt anchor. \n\n  Pitch 3 in the Lawyer guidebook is a scramble to the base of the shield (large clean slab of rock with few features). We felt comfortable not belaying this out as a pitch, and just wandering up to the shield and re-flaking the rope. \n\n  Pitch 3 10a 100ft.   -Look for a 6ft pillar sticking out of the steep slab. The third pitch of Free Ride climbs the right side of it. Traverse in easily from the left, clip a bolt, do some cruxy slab moves to get to the base of the pillar, and place gear in a crack on the left side of the pillar. Layback the crack and make an easy mantle onto the pillar. Clip another bolt, and climb straight up the slab, clip up another bolt, and move left to a flake. Place a couple of pieces of gear behind the flake and pull over the overlap (second crux). Climb past one more bolt to a two bolt anchor.  Very good pitch. The guidebook calls this and the next pitch some of the best face climbing on the east coast. I agree. You can link this pitch with the next one with a 60m rope. \n\n  Pitch 4 5.9+ pg-13 100ft.    -Similar climbing to the last pitch, but with more bolts and less gear. There is (what felt to me to be) a substantial run-out between the 1st and second bolt. When leading I wanted a bolt or piece of gear right in between the two bolts; they are spaced about twice as far apart as the other bolts. But the climbing between the two bolts is about 5.8. But I still found it spicy. The pitch doesnt have a distinct crux; each section by a bolt felt like a 5.9 slab move to me. Linking this pitch with the 3rd made a beautiful, sustained, mentally draining 200 ft pitch of sustained yet varied and interesting slab climbing.  \n\n  -At the fourth pitch belay, a peregrine started warning dives and calls towards me. Additionally, the upper corners were soaking wet, even though the rest of the route was mostly dry. We rappelled, so the information for the second half is from the guidebook and what I saw. Anyone who has climbed the full route, feel free to offer a better description. I hope to get back in the fall and complete the route. \n\n  Pitch 5. 10a 60ft?    -Really short looking pitch, mainly scrambling up bushy ledges, with the crux coming at a 15ft slab protected by a single bolt. Ends on the Lunch Ledge   Pitch 6. 11a. 80ft?    -Climb the overhanging corner on the left side of the lunch ledge. There looks to be a finger sized crack in the corner, and in the second half of the corner the angle eases. Belay at a fixed anchor at the obvious base of the beautiful Endurance Corner.   Pitch 7. 10d 80ft?    -Climb the beautiful and continuous corner to a stance under the roof at the top. It looks to protect with hand sized cams, and there are three bolts in a row in the second half of the pitch.   Pitch 8. 10c. 70ft?    -The Houdini Traverse. Traverse left under the roof for about 40ft with great exposure, passing several bolts. At the end of the roof, climb straight up the steep face to the top of the cliff.\n\n The first half of this route is really good, on much better and cleaner rock than the popular Diagonal. The second half of the route looks even better, especially the last two pitches. ","protection":"","location":"The prominent upper corners can be seen from the ground when approaching from the left.

Free Ride starts at the far left side of this. Look for a clean right facing corner with a roof towards the top, and a bolt on the left wall. This is the first pitch. You scramble up some ledges from the right to get to a belay stance right under the pitch.

A combination of; scrambling, you choose when to rope up, tree island linking, climbing, then getting back down. Given highest grade because of the greatness of the \"sum of the parts\" .. a true wilderness climbing experience with a little bit of everything, good and bad.   Many thanks, and all credit goes to Steve R. for the following detailed description..\n\n  \" The Case route zig-zags up\" the rock buttresses to climbers right of the central depression. Aside from the start you do not climb within the central depression per se. There are 7 pitches (one short slab traverse followed by 6 ledges [or 3 zig-zags]). This route mostly follows a series of ledges covered with grass and trees. The route's line can be somewhat visualized from Summit Rock by following the tree-lined ledge system to climbers right of the central depression.\n\n P1 - Start 10-20 feet to the right of the highest point of land below the central depression of Wallface. A Climb 30 feet straight up very easy (low 5th class), but unprotected,  wet/dry scrambling . Once, you reach  a small ledge, traverse right 70 feet to a tree island,  below a large rock buttress, the traverse protects fairly . (You may want to put your climbing shoes away at this point--the rest of the route is mostly on grass and/or rocky ledges where a semi-rigid alpine boot works best.\n\n P2 - Traverse ~180ft right along a grass and tree covered ledge until you see the next obvious ramp, which goes upwards and to the left. There is also old tat here. This, as well as the subsequent pitches, have the occasional boulder or rock move to navigate over and/or around. (P2: the first zig right)\n\n P3 - Climb a tree, rock, and grass covered ramp up and left ~140ft. Awkward moves around boulders and trees. Some exposurerie . Once again there's some old tat to belay from. You know to stop here because you can see the next, somewhat obvious tree and grass covered ramp leading up and right (look for the easiest option). Climbing further left leads you into the central depression--you do not want to go in this direction. (Of note, one continues along this ramp into the central depression if you want to climb Weissner's Route, which is a different 5.5 climb--see guide book). (P3: the first zag left)\n\n 4 - Follow the tree, rock, and grass covered ramp up and right ~120ft and belay from moderately sized alcove. This belay station is protected and comfortable. Once again build a gear anchor or use old tat, if present. The next ramp up and left is obvious and marks where you should stop. (P4: the second zig right)\n\n P5 - Once again follow the ramp up and left. This pitch is shorter than the previous 3 (~100ft). This pitch has a rock move or two in the middle that is mid-5th class and readily protectable, both before and after the moves. You belay from a well-protected spot within a small grove of pine trees. You can see and coach your second through the rock moves from this belay spot. There is old tat present. (P5: the second zag left) P6 - Longer that P5 (~150ft). Go up and right along the ramp system of least resistance. Starting this pitch stay low at first, wrestle with a l tree, then gain ttl he b ramp (versus going straight up to gain the ramp). About halfway there's another move or two of mid 5th class rock with great exposure. It's readily protectable with a #2 or #3 BD cam before, and a old piton after. There is a jug for hands and a crack large enough to jam a stiff boot perfectly. Next, continue along the ramp around a chossy bulge (or buttress) to nice belay spot in an alcove high and right. (There will be significant rope drag around this chossy buldge and you will be out of communication with your second. Alternatively, this pitch can be split into two with the leader belaying just past the rock moves--this latter option is not great because the gear options are limited). (P6: third zig right)\n\n P7 - Take the long grassy, rocky, and tree-strewn ramp ~180 to the top. This ramp is obvious and easier than the previous two pitches. Some rock moves, but they're low 5th class. About 20ft from the belayer, stay climbers left over the top and outside of a large boulder (i.e. not between the boulder and rock wall, where a tree blocks you're progress--the second, however, may be forced to go between the boulder and the wall due to rope tensiong, ). Follow the ramp up and left with good gear to you reach a small tree, place a directional, then climb the mossy ground above the rock face to an old tat anchor in the small trees about 25 above the cliff. You will be out of communication with your second.\n\n DESCENT: Adirondack Rock recommends to bushwack off--not to rappel. I would agree. The rap stations were all old tat attached to suspect features and small trees (Fall 2018). Plus there is significant risk of getting your rope caught and too many random tat stations to know exactly where to go. That said, with new slings, etc. this route can be rapped. We walked off to climber left. It probably took 2 hours to get back to the trail. First summit Wallface mountain by nasty bushwhacking. Just south of the summit is a large football field sized of cut down trees (maybe as a helicopter rescue point?). From here the bushwhacking is easier with the occasional faint trail. The faint trail follows near the cliff edge to the east and likely meets up with the potential walk-off option from \"The Diagonal.\" From here the route south and then south east is marked by pink ribbons on tree branches. The bushwhacking is easy here. You eventually drop into a wide col south of the Wallface summit. From here you follow the pink ribbons more east back around the southern margin of the Wallface cliff. Here we lost track of pink ribbons (or they stopped), and just went directly down to where the Indian Pass trail and the Diagonal approach trail (which is different and more south than where The Case route approach trail) meet. This was mostly eastward around the occasional cliff band and stream covered slides. This bushwack was moderate in October--but like dangerous in the dark, due the sudden and occasional drop-offs. Once back on the trail, one can head back uphill (ugh) to the previously mentioned campsite, or back to the Wallface lean-to (~2 miles) versus Upper Works parking lot ~4 miles away.","protection":" One 60M rope (if walking off). One set of nuts, one set of cams 0.3-3. Slings: 7 alpine single and 3 double. Rock shoes for P1. Semi-rigid alpine boots P2-7. GPS and headlights. Radios could be useful. This route can be safely climbed in the rain. All pitches are traverses that can be safely belayed from above with a Munter. (P1, P2, P3, P4, P7 are 4th to low 5th class. P5 and P6 have short segments of exposed bouldery moves.) ","location":"From the Indian Pass hiking trail (ADK #125) you break west towards the central depression of Wallface just north of Summit Rock. You know you're at the correct spot to leave the hiking trail because there is a small stream (Indian Pass Brook) adjacent to both a cabin-sized boulder and obvious/excellent camping spot. Standing north of the boulder in the camping spot you take the southern of two herd-like paths (the northern one goes to a less optimal camping spot). Take this faint herd-path straight upwards to the central depression of Wallface (ie the highest point of trees below the central face). The path is somewhat apparent--but straight up is also fine. Once you hit the rock face you follow it up and left to the highest point of trees and land--the route starts about 10-20 feet right of this eventual highpoint. The approach from the trail to the start of the climb is about 30 minutes. (Of note, the Wallface lean-to is about 2 miles south of summit rock on the Indian Pass hiking trail).\n\n Check Adirondack Rock for excellent pictures and info. Although \"The Diagonal\" (5.8), as well as the central depression of Wallface, can be seen from Summit Rock (a small rock outcropping along the hiking trail south of Indian Pass), the Case Route is hard to visualize due to heavy trees. The Case Route route zigzags up the large rock butresses to climbers right of the central depression--it does not go up the central depression itself--following numerous tree and grass covered ramps."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,589a474a-bbce-5213-a77d-8138a22e0474,21c0dcef-75a2-5517-93ef-0026142ec2a0,2355ce0f-6bd8-5f66-a1cc-7002c38ea4a4,f10aa416-1585-50fb-a4b8-44cdb18462a3","pathTokens":["USA","New York","Adirondacks","E: High Peaks Region","Wallface"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":9,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":3,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":3,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.035,44.137]},"bbox":[-74.0356265497435,44.13655033981814,-74.03437345025651,44.13744966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106444637","area_id":"8QqkFhWFUPukuETNsYRiow=="},"content":{"description":"Wallface is the largest and tallest cliff of NY state: almost 800' of very steep rock.
