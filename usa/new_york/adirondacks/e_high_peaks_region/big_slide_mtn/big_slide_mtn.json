The climbing is exposed, very thoughtful, delicate and footwork intensive. In late summer the slab is covered with a colorful canvas of lichen (but not slippery) which really makes you search for \"holds\". \n\n  When my partner and I approached the base I called it a \"pussy route\" and offered to lead in my approach shoes. I must've been delirious because I was hungover, fatigued, dehydrated and had the worst case of ball chafing ever. Good thing he convinced me otherwise.
