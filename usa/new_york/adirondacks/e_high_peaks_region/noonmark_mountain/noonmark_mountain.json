If you like to tick off Fritz Weissner Routes this is a must visit.  All the routes are short (100 ft) but are of high quality rock.  The rock is exposed, weathered and sharp.  The cliff faces SSW.  The routes and surrounding views are well worth the long approach.  We set up a fixed rappel line and left our packs on the summit, but walking back to the cliff base is nearly as quick.  Long webbing and extra mid-sized cams help to set up the rappel anchors.  Due to the high hiker traffic on the summit, we inspected our anchors closely before each rappel.  Standard rack. You should note that there were no chalk marks on these climbs prior to our climbing.  This is a great outing on rock less traveled. \n\n  This area is located in the Dix Mountain Wilderness area, and hence bear canisters are not required."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:03.895Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:22.725Z"}
