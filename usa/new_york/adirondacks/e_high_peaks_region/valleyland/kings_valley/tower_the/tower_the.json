A second boulder (which evidently was once the same boulder and has broken in half) rests directly at the base, creating a huge slab landing if you were to swing away from the roof. Bring as many pads as you have access to. The face climbing is very good, and swinging on the roof is amazing. This is the perfect spot to bring a group of friends, load up the landing with pads, and just take turns running laps on hard, highball face climbing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:05.119Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:39.195Z"}
