This route provides an alternative way of achieving the summit to Rooster Comb with great airy, alpine style climbing. Each pitch is varied and unique. The belays are all comfortable with good stances.  \n\n  Pitch 1 5.4 G Climb the broken corner to the roof, traversing right passing a pin to a small ledge on a corner. (Option: Belay here to avoid rope drag) Continue up arete, climbing crack to a pin (crux) and finish on large ledge with right leaning crack to build a gear anchor. Large gear could prove to be helpful moving up to the pin. (90 ft) \n\n  Pitch 2 5.4 G Climb crack to the chimney, passing a pin (crux). (50 ft) \n\n  Pitch 3 4th class traverse, moving around corner to tree. Belay using the crack system and/or the tree. Great airy position.
