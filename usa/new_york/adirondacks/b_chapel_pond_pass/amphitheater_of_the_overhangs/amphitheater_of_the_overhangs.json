It looks out of place in the realm of Adirondack climbing, as it breaks a series of large roofs directly via a fist/hand/finger crack. The crack starts wide and gets narrower as it rises. The crux is passing the highest of the roofs.It used to have two chockstones down low, but upward rope pressure from a fall dislodged one and it hit the belayer (me), which REALLY hurt (see photo). Make sure your rope runs by the remaining stone and not around it.What more do you need? Just look at the photos!Â ","protection":"Standard rack, extra hand size pieces, single #4, optional #5.
