This route has the better climbing of the two routes, but it is much more runout. The guidebook gives this climb a rating of G, but it is clear just standing at the base of this climb that there is ground fall potential going for the second bolt. Technically the crux is well protected by the first bolt. But there are several hard moves that follow the crux on your way to the jug below bolt two that would not be good to blow. After this the climbing is easier and better protected. The top is lichen-y but fun adventure sport climbing.","protection":"I think 6 draws. It's pretty short.
