The crag has two routes, one older route that is now pretty dirty (Heat Wave, 5.10) on the right side, and the other a high-quality, steep face climb (Hot Flash, 5.12a) centered in the face.\n\n You can set an anchor for toproping via a short, easy rappel. This anchor serves the two known routes, although to toprope Heat Wave you will need some directional gear (the route leans left for its entire length). To access the top, walk right and scramble up a depression in the face.\n\n The Boxcar swimming hole is also known as Shoebox Falls, and is labeled as such on some maps."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:08.746Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:44.495Z"}
