There are great hands for the entire route. The route wanders back and forth for protection, but veers right to an uncomfortably small birch tree with some super sketchy tat. I would not rely on this tree staying for long and definitely do not rappel here! If you have a 60m+, I would consider climbing slightly higher to more solid trees.\n\n P2: Scramble to the top of the ledge, across plenty of lichen. There are multiple small trees and a significant scree field. Cross the scree field and there is a good tree with a rappel ring. This rappel is some old tat, a new cordelette, and a steel ring that has seen better days.
