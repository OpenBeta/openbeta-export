Like most slab climbing, the key to becoming a champion slab master is a combination punch--maximize the surface area of your feet and maintain your momentum.  Like Don Mellor admits in his soon to be replaced guidebook, \"Admittedly, the moves aren't really that hard.  Instead it is the whole picture of exposure and commitment that makes the climb so rewarding.\"   \n\n  The best introduction to the Slabs is the Regular Route.  It offers substantial protection, when needed, and it offers several variations and options to pass slower parties if you plan to climb it on a beautiful weekend day."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:08.745Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:44.483Z"}
