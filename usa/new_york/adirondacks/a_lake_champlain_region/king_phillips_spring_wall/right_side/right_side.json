The cracks look as if a giant claw raked the side of the rock. Work up and right following the cracks.  The short lived crux comes at about midheight through a thin section.  After this trend right a bit then step back left to follow a crack to the top.  A very nice looking and fun climb.","protection":"Gear is good.
