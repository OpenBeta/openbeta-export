The rock here is solid and varied. The name comes from a move at the top of the left-facing edge that requires a large wingspan (if you're tall) or a leap straight rightwards to a jug (beware of flappers!). \n\n  From the corner at the right side of the face, move up the face (V2) to a horizontal at the base of the distinct left-facing edge. Go up the edge to its top, and a decent shake on the left. Make the leap to the right and better holds. The climbing becomes overhanging here. Go up some good jugs, then up past a nipple to a pinch, and a gaston right to the anchor. \n\n  You can set up a TR by leading \"Coming of Age\" (5.10b) to the left.","protection":"Bolts, fixed anchor.","location":"The route is located on the only clean-bottom-to-top, narrow shield of rock on the right end of the cliff, left of the ice route Rites of Passage, and just left of a large square cave 25' up.
