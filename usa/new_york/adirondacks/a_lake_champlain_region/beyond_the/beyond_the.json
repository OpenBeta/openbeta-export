The crux involves fighting a barn-door move, and is much harder if you're short. Very coarse rock with excellent friction. \n\n  Go up the slab, over some overlaps, then up a left-facing corner to its top. Reach right and go up another, smaller left-facing corner. Mantel onto slopers, then move up a face past a bolt to some jugs.
