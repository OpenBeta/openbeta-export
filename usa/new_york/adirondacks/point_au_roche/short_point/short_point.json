Extremely hard to find non-chossy boulders in this spot, and you will see an obvious arete to this climbs right that is too crumbly to do. This route is more solid, yet shorter.Start at the bottom of the cavy area between the wall and the loose rocks behind. DO NOT USE ROCKS BEHIND YOU FOR THIS ROUTE. Will be a left side-pull and a good right pinch or another small sidepull to start. Lots of options/variations. Easy top out, but beware of the loose rock on the top, you don't want to fall back onto the sharper rocks below. ","protection":"","location":"Park at the boat launch near the beach at Point Au Roche. Walk down the trail for Short Point. Go all the way out onto the point, then go east (hikers left), and down.
