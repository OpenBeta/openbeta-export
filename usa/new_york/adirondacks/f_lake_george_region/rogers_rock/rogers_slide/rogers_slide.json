(See COMMENT below from the leader of the FA.) The issue, I guess, is that protection is non-existent for well over 100 ft.\n\n Indeed, I can't say that I led this climb...5.7+ X is \"a bit above my pay grade\", but did climb it about 10-12 years ago by rigging a 2-rope top rope from one of the anchors on Little Finger and then using a directional off (I think) a wire stopper in one of the thin cracks about 140-160 ft up. The climbing moves are superb and if the occasion presents itself (i.e. you're not \"hogging\" the anchor on LF) this is a reasonable way to do this \"very 'X' route\"\n\n I spoke with Jim Kolcotronis (of the FA party of Little Finger itself) the weekend after the FA of Little Finger and the description he gave me at that time was that the 5.7 3rd pitch crack was the route of FA, and thus the 5.5 \"exit to the right\" was added later.
