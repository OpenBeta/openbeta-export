Traverse left past 4 bolts before moving down to bolted anchor, avoiding the desire to clip the first bolt of P2. If either you or your follower fall at any point you'll likely end up wet. Good luck.\n\nP2—Move up toward the left side of the overlap. Pull over it and then head up and left passing more bolts. I think there are about 6 bolts total on this 80' pitch.\n\nDescent—There are two bolted anchors at the top of the slab and Walk the Plank ends at the leftmost one. Unless you're going to rappel into the lake, or reversing the traverse on P1, it doesn't make any sense to rappel down to the end of P1. Further, it was unclear to us whether with our single 60m we'd make it down diagonally right to the start of the climb. What we did was rappel nearly horizontally right to the rightmost bolted anchor (~30') before rapping down to the start. Our single 60m made it fine.","protection":"8 Quickdraws","location":"The climb starts right at the technical boat landing. You should see a line of bolts ~10' above the water.
