Sustained and varied climbing with exposure and solid rock.  I'm not sure if the climb's name refers to this, but there are certainly three distinct portions of this route.  Part one - climb a steep face on nice holds clipping a few bolts as you go.  A cruxy mantle move gains a sloping ledge below a crack in a left facing corner.  Part two - climb the short, but steep corner (gear here) to a hands free stance on the right edge of the face.  Enjoy the views of Lake George and get ready for some exposure.  Part three - move up to the right side an outside corner (arete). Reach around left and clip a bolt.  Make another move or two up and then make an exciting and exposed move around to the left with 100 feet of air below.  Clip one more bolt and pull through to the top on jugs.
