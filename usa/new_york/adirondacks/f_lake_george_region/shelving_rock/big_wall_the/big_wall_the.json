This route is alot of fun.  It just keeps on coming at you.  Begin by climbing up a vertical face, shopping around the many holds to a decent stance beneath the wave (an overhanging blank face with a bolt).  Find a way to reach up and grab a jug and crank through the overhang on more jugs.  Pull into a left facing corner with slabby feet.  Another puzzle of small holds (crux, in my opinion) gains more jugs beneath another set of overhangs.  Step right slightly and make a tough move through the overhangs into a left facing corner then up to a ledge.  Continue up the black face about which probably goes at 5.8 but felt alot harder after 75' of climbing.  Bolt anchors.","protection":"Bolts...12 i think.","location":"Right most bolt line on the Big Wall.  There is a cave under huge boulders leaning against the cliff.
