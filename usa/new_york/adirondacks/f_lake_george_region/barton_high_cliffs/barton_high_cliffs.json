Very secluded, and it appears that the last period of popular climbing here was in the early 1990s.  Lots of rock fall in the surrounding area around the cliffs, some looking recent.  Loose rock on climbs also.  Test any blocks or flakes for the hollow/loose sound/feel before pulling or placing protection.  There is a fair amount of lichen, but nothing out of the ordinary for the Lake George area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:05.121Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:24.194Z"}
