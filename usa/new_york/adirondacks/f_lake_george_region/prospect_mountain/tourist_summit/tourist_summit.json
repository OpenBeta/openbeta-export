Plenty of shade and fixed gear (like grills) so bring a hammock and plan to chill. You'll need quarters for the alien binoculars. It's busy in summer and fall, but you'll have it to yourself most of the year.The road-cuts to the right of the summit crack boulder have a lot of opportunity and have been scrambled quite a bit while some of the cleaner spans are actually quite challenging.The summit parking lot has 2 areas affording a choice of shade or sun depending on the temps and preference. There are a few small opportunities on the summit trail. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:04.430Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:08.822Z"}
