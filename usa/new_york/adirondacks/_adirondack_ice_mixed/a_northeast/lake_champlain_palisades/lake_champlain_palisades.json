It can only be accessed from the water, as the Palisades themselves are roughly 200ft. We were able to Kayak across the lake (roughly 1 mile). Be aware, there are zebra muscles close to the water line (or right on it depending on the lake water levels): it it highly recommended that you use a paddle board or something you can stand on in order to mount the wall, especially if water levels are low. We only had time to explore this one route (5 people climbing to roughly 30ft), but there are endless other route opportunities to be found. Beware of submerged rocks in other places though!","protection":"Deep water, no gear as of now.","location":"Make your way to the Palisades (about a 10 minute paddle north of barn rock. The cliffs are huge, you can't miss it). 'Texas Slab' is to the right (north) of the waterfall (which will be dry at most point of the year). Find the waterfall, go north just around the next outcropping (40 ft or so) and begin searching for the slab. It may be underwater or right on the waterline depending on the water levels. See pictures for identification. As the name suggests, the slight outcropping at the base of the route is shaped like the state of Texas. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,589a474a-bbce-5213-a77d-8138a22e0474,21c0dcef-75a2-5517-93ef-0026142ec2a0,2fe96083-6bca-5f7a-960d-ac364d0ffce5,fedd967c-e4d9-522d-aea6-f0f9fea065bc,a06ed7b6-18ae-5936-ac8f-a858de03c54e","pathTokens":["USA","New York","Adirondacks","* Adirondack Ice & Mixed","A: Northeast","Lake Champlain Palisades"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.3647,44.2181]},"bbox":[-73.36532741209193,44.217650339818135,-73.36407258790808,44.21854966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108045130","area_id":"oG7XthiuWTasj6hY3gPFTg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-73.36532741209193,44.217650339818135],[-73.36407258790808,44.217650339818135],[-73.36407258790808,44.21854966018187],[-73.36532741209193,44.21854966018187],[-73.36532741209193,44.217650339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"This 200'-tall, sheer cliff drops into the waters of Lake Champlain on the easternmost edge of the Adirondack Park about 4.5 miles north of Westport.
