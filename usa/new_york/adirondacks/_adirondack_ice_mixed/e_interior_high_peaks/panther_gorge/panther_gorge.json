Some of the longest sustained routes in the area live here - for those who enjoy \"adventure climbing\", this is a destination. \n\n  Conditions can vary a lot - so ask around and please post comments and conditions photos here so that others can be forewarned. \n\n  Many of the areas (Agharta, Feline walls) build ice quickly in early months (Nov/Dec) of winter, then can back off when the days get longer in Feb March. The gully lines should last longer."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.282Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:27.517Z"}
