The approach is arduous in winter, and requires camping. The reward is a number of excellent climbs in a wilderness setting. Given the general southwest exposure of the cliff, some of the climbs can become baked so mid-season colder spells are likely best."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.281Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:11.802Z"}
