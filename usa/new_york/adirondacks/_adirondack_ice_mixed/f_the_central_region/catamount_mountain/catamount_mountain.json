Generally, there is ice to climb should you slog out here, but the best lines may be out unless conditions are optimal. According to the original ice explorer, if Power Play is in - really in -, the ice here will be good. I'm not sure how well that holds, but it's something to go by.   There are several excellent lines here, most including a bit of mixed capability to reach the top. While many of these can be top-roped, the means to do so for most of them is ridiculously complex or wearisome; at least one person in the party should be comfortable leading Grade 4 ice and at least M3 mixed."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.914Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:28.218Z"}
