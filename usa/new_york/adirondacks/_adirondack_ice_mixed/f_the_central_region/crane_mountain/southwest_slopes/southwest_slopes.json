Some of these routes lie directly above the main hiking trail, so access is easy for them, but please avoid dumping debris (or yourself!) on passersby.   Many of the routes here receive a lot of afternoon sun, so they must be climbed in the morning hours. Most of the routes here are more alpine outings than \"pure\" ice climbing ventures. A few extremely challenging lines await an ascent.   To date, I've never seen any other parties on any of these routes at any time when I was on them. Only once have I met another party, other than my own, ice climbing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.916Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:27.912Z"}
