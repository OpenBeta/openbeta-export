The original approach reached Central's cliff first, but in order to cross Raquette Brook in high water, one must follow the rockclimber's route, so both trails have been merged. The approach now reaches Right first.   The boundary between Starbuck Left and Starbuck Central is a broad, shallow gully beginning about 100m west of Central's main face ice flows.   Central's boundary with Starbuck Right is the beginning of the Starbuck Right Wall, a prominent buttress of broken rock with an obvious large right-facing corner on its right (which is where Corner Cafe goes).   Starbuck Central has several so-so routes leading to its first major flow, on the left side of the \"main face\". The Main Face itself has that fat flow, which supports at least two separate lines, followed by several very thin, challenging, and for the most part dangerous plastered lines to its right. Leading these latter routes is risky; fortunately there are plenty of trees and a decent walk-up on the right for top-roping."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.292Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:27.921Z"}
