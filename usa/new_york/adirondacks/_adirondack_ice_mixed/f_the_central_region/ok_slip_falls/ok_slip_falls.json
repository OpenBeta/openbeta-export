The seldom seen OK Slip Falls will become one of the popular destinations in the Adirondacks.  We hope the NY DEC constructs a large parking area and improves the dirt road into the tract to handle the future traffic. \n\n  There are no official trails in this newly acquired tract that also includes Blue Ledge, OK Slip Pond and a couple of other ponds.  There seems to be an access road that leads toward OK Slip Pond and then on to Carter Pond.  The access road is off of NY 28 about 8.5 miles east of Indian Lake,  here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.914Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:12.591Z"}
