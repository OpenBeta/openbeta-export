It has become an excellent destination for ice climbs up to 400'. \n\n  The tall, main cliff faces south and gets sun-baked, so early season is best. Aim for super cold, sunny days. If it's too baked, there is a shorter, north-facing wall to the left which holds ice until late season. \n\n  The cliff was explored for rock climbing by Jay Harrison. He also put up the first ice route, Sans DÃ©faillance, at the top of the gully that separates the north-facing wall from the main face."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.914Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:12.327Z"}
