Route 73 runs along the North edge of Upper and Lower Cascade Lakes, providing views of fat ice on both sides of the canyon.  While the flows on the South side are difficult to access, the obvious ice on the lower flanks of Pitchoff is only a short hike from the road, making it one of the most popular ice climbing areas in the Adirondacks. \n\n  The canyon is a natural wind tunnel, so dress warm.
