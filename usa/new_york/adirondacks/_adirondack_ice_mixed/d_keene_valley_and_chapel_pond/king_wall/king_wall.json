Ice does form on this wall, but it bakes in the early-morning sun and crashes down with alarming regularity. So far, nothing has been completed on the main wall. There are some routes on the far left, where the wall is shorter and slabbier, and of course, Cheese and Crackers, which is located on a sub-wall right of the main wall (and closer to the parking)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.296Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:42.901Z"}
