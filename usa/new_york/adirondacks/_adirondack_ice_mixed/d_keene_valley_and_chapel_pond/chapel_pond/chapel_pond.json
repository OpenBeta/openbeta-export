The pond area is directly across from the main parking lot on Rt. 73, while Chapel Pond Canyon is lookers right from the parking lot, and semi hidden down--you guessed it--a canyon.  The main face of Chapel Pond is NE facing, so it is sunny in the morning, then falls into the shade for most of the day. \n\n  Be wary of this area on beautiful weekend days, as it is also THE most popular ice climbing venue in all of the Adirondacks."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.912Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:28.036Z"}
