It's one of the more difficult \"roadside\" areas to reach, mainly because it's not really roadside, there is no trail, and the snow can be deep. You're much better off if somebody else breaks trail! (Bring snow shoes!)\n\n Facing into the canyon from the mouth at the height of land, the left wall faces northwest and gets a tiny bit of late-day sun; most of the routes are spread out on this wall, and it is very steep in places. The right wall faces southeast and gets baked; there aren't many routes on this wall, the exception being White Fang.\n\n For the pure ice routes, a rack of screws is sufficient. For the mixed routes, a full rock rack is required, and for the advanced stuff, take a double rack and even some pitons.\n\n The furthest wall in the canyon (on the left side) is the most impressive, and is the home to many mixed testpieces. Unfortunately, the right side of this is on private land, so don't climb right of Karen's Crack."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.283Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:27.751Z"}
