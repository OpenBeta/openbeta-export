There are more climbs than there are parking spaces.  The northern exposure and higher elevation ensures that NFOP comes in early and stays climbable late in the season.  It can be cold and windy, especially early in the season.  The climbs are mostly single pitch NEI 4 or long multi pitch NEI 3 to 3+."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.294Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:42.797Z"}
