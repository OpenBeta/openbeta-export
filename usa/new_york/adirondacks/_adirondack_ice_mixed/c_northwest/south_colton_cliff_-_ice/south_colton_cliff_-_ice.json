It's nothing to travel for, but for local climbers, it does feature one rather nice ice climb to lead or toprope.\n\n This crag was first discovered by Dave Furman in 1992 while cross country skiing, a student at Potsdam at the time, according to Adirondack Rock. Ice was the first thing to be climbed here.\n\n For info on the rock climbing here-\n\nmountainproject.com/v/southâ€¦"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.918Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:12.426Z"}
