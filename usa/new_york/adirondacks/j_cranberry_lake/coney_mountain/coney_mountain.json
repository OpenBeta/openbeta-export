Why, solo up the clean slab to its left, of course. No need to change shoes - or even drop the pack - Tom Lane just waltzed up to the top of the open rock to await our arrival.   It's really too bad that Coney's slopes aren't steeper, because its rock is incredibly grippy.   The end of open rock leaves you still well below the summit; you have to scramble up dirty blocks, gullies, and minute slabs to get there, but it only takes another 5 or so minutes to do so.","protection":"Effectively none.","location":"This is the cleanish, open swath of slab, 15m right of a right-facing corner formed by a large rock plate, that begins 20m up the left edge of the open rock.
