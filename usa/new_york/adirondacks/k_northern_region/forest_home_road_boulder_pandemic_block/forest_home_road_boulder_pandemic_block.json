From the road this boulder appears mossy and unappealing. However the South side that faces away from the road sports a clean, high quality rock face that's slightly overhanging. The South side of the boulder is about 10ft tall with a very flat base/landing. There are three independent lines and many more variations. The easiest descent is off the East side, using a tree for help. The location of this boulder makes it very likely that it was climbed on before 2020.
