NOT easy to find and hike to, I suspect this rock face is rarely visited or climbed, my early impression is that the cliff face probably ISN\"T worth a special trip unless you live in the area or unless you like backcountry adventure. Wet very and slippery during my visits, I hope to return when dry to better evaluate the area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.797Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:20.110Z"}
