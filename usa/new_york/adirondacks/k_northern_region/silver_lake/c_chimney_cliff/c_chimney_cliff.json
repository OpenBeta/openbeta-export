Pitch 2 tackles the crack system in the prominent groove to the left of the obvious overhanging crack system in the head wall above the P1 anchor. It is possible to climb only Pitch 1 and rappel, though P1 requires at least one piece of gear as a directional unless you want to be a dick to your second (guide says #2 C3, though I found a .5 C4 to be better) \n\nP1 (5.10+): Climb up the slab/face to the first bolt. Progress through the tiers till the third bolt and decode a sequence to exit the roof (crux) to a system of good cracks on the right side of the roof. Work up/right to the fixed anchor. 50' \n\nP2 (5.11-): Step right from the anchor and finesse your way up the slab passing two bolts (crux #1) to a stance below the bulging crack with a horizontal above your head. Execute a boulder sequence to gain the horizontal. Follow the crack as it thins down and make a transition from the tight tips to hands (crux #2). Tech your way up the crack system/corner/groove passing some jugs to easier terrain and a thoughtful move here and there that puts you on a slab with a dead tree and a fixed anchor to the right of the tree. 110'","protection":"P1: Three bolts, two-bolt anchor \n\nP2: Two bolts, two-bolt anchor \n\nProtection: A single rack of BD C3s and C4s to 1\" should be adequate.
