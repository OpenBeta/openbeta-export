The cliff faces northwest which makes it a great hot weather destination. There are 30+ routes ranging from 5.6 to 5.11 in difficulty, as well as a few open projects. The climbing is single pitch with a mix of crack and face climbing up to 100'. The cliff features a bit of everything: thin technical face climbing, roof pulling, hand cracks, OW cracks and even a full length chimney. All climbs have two bolt anchors.I would expect to run into a party or two on nice weather weekends but, as with most Adk crags, I wouldn't expect to ever see a crowd.The rock quality is very good. Solid and grippy similar to nearby Lost T cliff. Many of the routes are still a little bit dirty, but should clean up with some more traffic. I would say bring a wire brush to be on the safe side. This is not to take away from the massive effort the Arietta Team has done to make State Brook easy to access, safe and an all around fun place to climb. I'd like to see a pic of the place before development began.There is plenty of information out there with full route descriptions and directions to the cliff. The Arietta Team has posted a downloadable PDF file here: thomannengineering.com/arie…Adirondack Rock has information as well:http://www.adirondackrock.com/newroutes.htm#SM_State_Brook and a new digital guidebook available in the Gunks+ app."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":35,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:05.122Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:39.445Z"}
