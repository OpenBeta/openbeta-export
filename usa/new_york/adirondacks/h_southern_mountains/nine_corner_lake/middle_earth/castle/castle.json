But still steep enough that you do need to be slightly careful. Not honestly a great problem in its own right, but I found it useful to do before doing People Fall Apart so I knew what I was getting into (since slab that shallow is relatively foreign terrain for me).Start on the little boulder below the slab and just climb straight up it. You needn’t use the right arete, but the grade isn’t dramatically different if you do.
