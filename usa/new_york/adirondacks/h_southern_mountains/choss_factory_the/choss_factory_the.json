It breaks through the prominent roof on the left side. The climbing is excellent, difficult, and dramatic.\n\n Climb a slab into a left-facing corner. Reach around right into a crack and climb this with difficulty to the roof. The first crux is low in the crack. Wild moves lead leftwards through the roof to a stance. Continue up the crack to where it stops about 10' below the top. Go up the steep face to a mantel onto a slab and a fixed anchor.\n\n The rock on this cliff is extremely bad and hollow. The cracks, despite appearances, don't hold cams. Hence the fixed protection.","protection":"Quickdraws; fixed anchor.","location":"Left side of the cliff, below the only vertical crack on the cliff."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,589a474a-bbce-5213-a77d-8138a22e0474,21c0dcef-75a2-5517-93ef-0026142ec2a0,f822ec29-5b40-580b-bf0d-6d392c9fe4ff,40a15976-4c38-576a-a0af-59b51471565b","pathTokens":["USA","New York","Adirondacks","H: Southern Mountains","Choss Factory, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.56091,43.2618]},"bbox":[-74.56152747013931,43.261350339818144,-74.56029252986069,43.262249660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114391197","area_id":"QKFZdkw4V2qgr1m1FHFWWw=="},"content":{"description":"This is a super steep, sheer, and surprisingly chossy cliff on the southeast shoulder of State Brook Mountain.
