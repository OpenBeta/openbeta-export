This area has had climbers visiting since at least the 1950's however recently the land was posted as no trespassing and violators will be prosecuted. The climbs here were regularly climbed and offered some amazing routes up to 5.13. This area is sorely missed but the Access fund and other climbers are were working on opening access to the area... If someone local wants to work on access I encourage them to reach out to the Access Fund and potentially the owners.\n\nCLOSED CRAG. We used to park on Byram lake rd. just across 684, cross the road and follow the trail up and right to the cliff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.271Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:05.780Z","_change":{"user":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw==","historyId":"6404450d33ce213edad29656","prevHistoryId":"6404450c33ce213edad2964d","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"updatedBy":"rxDUVMc5QUiq75Hpq+nDVw=="}
