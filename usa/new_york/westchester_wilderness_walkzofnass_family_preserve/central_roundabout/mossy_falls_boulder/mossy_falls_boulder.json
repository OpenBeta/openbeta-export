It's unlikely to see much traffic and with the main face being adjacent to the \"mossy falls\", it would be a good idea to bring a brush as moss and lichens reclaim the face. The main face is also right on the trail so make sure not to sprawl and be conscientious of hikers. The main face is about 20 ft tall. The rock quality is good but still be wary of crystals that may break, especially near the top."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.918Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:38:28.197Z"}
