There are three falls. The upper falls is about 60' high and the other two are 40' each. The walk-in to the upper falls is 10 min or less.  \n\n  Most set up top ropes at the top of the upper falls and then rap down to the base. There's also a trail that circles back around the falls if you don't want to rap or have a lot of gear to carry.  \n\n  You'll generally need 100' of static line. Most tie into a tree on either side of the Plotter Kill and then adjust depending on the portion of the falls to be climbed.  \n\n  To reach the other two falls, continue downstream on the trail. You'll reach the third falls first. From the base of the third falls, walk upstream and you'll backtrack to the 2nd set of falls."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:08.747Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:29.342Z"}
