Start sitting burrowed down in at the base of the dihedral, where the crack is at a big-finger size. Make a few moves through the perfect to tight fingers, then turn the lip. I found exiting to the left to be a bit easier, but you could also go straight up using the small left-facing arÃªte formed by the right wall. Scramble off to the right. \n\n  I don't boulder much so don't really know about the grade, but it felt like pretty solid 5.11 crack moves to me. More importantly, it is really fun!","protection":"A pad, possibly a spotter","location":"This is on the south side of Joe's Hill, about a 3 minute hike off of an unmarked trail that splits off from the white trail near Junction #30 (see map on Ward Pound Ridge Reservation web site). It is hard to make out this section of rock until you are right on top of it, but look for the ~20 foot squeeze (see picture) to help orient yourself.
