You can avoid the first move by walking out onto the large boulder. When the crack ends, move maybe 6 feet left until you can mantle up onto the ledge (that is maybe 10' below the top). A step or two back to the right and you can top out. This short route might just possibly pack in more pumpy climbing than any other 5.8 at PK. TR VARIATION - Start 10 ft to the left and climb the arete to the end of the leftwards traverse. Terrific (5.10). OTHER VARIATION - Climb the first 15 ft as usual, then move right a few feet and climb the crack and right-facing flake, passing a laurel bush. Finish in a small notch-recess (5.7ish).","protection":"Adequate gear if leading's your thing. Normal stuff up to #3 Camalot.
