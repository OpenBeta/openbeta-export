The climbs in this area are not formally documented. Most of the climbs are single-pitch and can be climbed trad or top-roped. There are almost no bolts in the area.\n\n The Access Fund has sponsored labor and events to help everyone access Lost City.\n\n While this area entry will remain pictures-only, more specific information is available in many places on the internet: Gallery, a Blog, a Trip Report, another Blog, yet another Blog, and the R+S blog.  Don't miss videos; these are only a few: video, video,\n\nvideo.\n\n If you want to know more, ask at Rock + Snow, or ask a Preserve climbing ranger -- verbal sharing is the tradition.  If you are in the know and someone asks you, please share.\n\n When you visit Lost City, please actively preserve everyone's wilderness exploration experience. Limit your group size to fewer than 4, and your toprope runs to even fewer. Leave your hammock, dogs, speakers and cigars at home. Tread carefully, so that others may simply tread."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:11.550Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:18.210Z"}
