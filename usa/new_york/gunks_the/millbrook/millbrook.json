Turn the roof (you can bypass the rotten hold over the lip that flexes like rubber by means of an undercling) and climb past a short left-facing block to a right-facing corner and two tri-cam placements in holes. Before the overhang, traverse low and left to two sharp right facing edges, to go up and circle clockwise around the forementioned overhang. From here circle counter-clockwise around the next overhang past a right-facing crack and corner. At the top of the corner keep circling around and then up a crack to traverse left onto a small ledge. Using two ropes for this pitch is the only reasonable way to deal with the protection.  If you use a single rope it will zigzag, which means if you fall all the pro will all pop out. \n\n  2st Pitch: Climb around the loose block on the right (same as Great White Throne Judgment) and then climb up and left along its crack system until you reach the end.  (The lose block has historical significance, so it has to stay there, do not touch it and it will stay there.)  Then traverse left a little more to a pocket.  From the pocket, traverse left again via two holds, then climb up to a second pocket in the horizontal.  From here traverse directly right to a bucket and then climb straight up past a wobbly block sitting in the wall (the block is in a small ledge and will not come out unless you deliberately pull it out) to go over an overhang and up to a stance, with larger gear on right. It will be helpful to note that at the stance there is a very odd friend placement on the right that appears to be bomber for setting up the belay, but for some unknown reason that gear is always popping out, possibly because the crack is lined with shale which is as slippery as soap.  \n\n  3rd Pitch:  Directly above the 1.75 - 2.5\" cam placement just right of the belay, stick-clip gear or replace the 1 - 1.5\" cam in a pocket above with a 10' pole.  The cam goes in deep, and more than halfway, when you find the pocket it will be obvious. (You can use a 10' x 1\" piece of steel conduit you can buy at Home Depot, tape, and some string with a shoe lace knot to do this.)  Do not be tempted to place gear in the slab.  Do not weaken the slab by hanging on cams in the slab, this will more than double your weight on the slab, and if you fall then it will be more then double.  Sound protection can be found in the corner where the slab meets the wall, in the wall, and in the aforementioned pocket above.  The cam on the pole goes in the pocket easily.  If you cannot figure this all out, or see the reason for keeping gear out of the slab, you do not belong on the climb because your efforts will set a pattern that will destroy the climb by weakening the slab. And if you risk or take a leader fall on it you have no good brain.  \n\n  Climb up to the forementioned giant slab under the roof, and traverse out right, halfway to turn the roof to the aforementioned pocket.  Turn the next part of the roof (reaching out and left) and then traverse left for 8' at the lip by heal hooking up to the horizontal cracks.  Lean right and climb a short left-facing corner to a ramp at a hole in the rock, and up to the tree.  \n\n  4th Pitch.

You can fill up your water bottles here.]  \n\n   Climbing up in elevation abruptly you will eventually reach the edge of the actual cliff edge of Millbrook Mountain by means of a few camel backs.

Surprisingly, there is little roof climbing at all - rather a series wildly exposed corners and traverses that are almost reminiscent of features one might find on granite. Unfortunately this fun pitch is guarded by one-to-two pitches of dirty, loose rock. If only there were a way to rap in and just sample the upper bit... \n\n  For this route to deserve the classic status it has been given in various guidebooks, I really think it would take a ton more traffic to clean it up, but what do I know? \n\n  Rap down to the GT Ledge and find your way to the base of the route which can be identified by a patch of yellow, broken rock with a long, 3' deep roof about 30' off the ground. Above this roof is a long, narrow right-facing corner and to the right of this corner are two large bushes, one above the other. Your goal is to pull through the roof directly below this corner, and then climb the corner squeezing past the bushes on your right, eventually working back left and up into the massive right-facing corners and roofs at the top of the wall. \n\n  P1: Climb hollow, yellow rock and pull the low roof with some difficulty. Climb easily up the right-facing corner above, passing the first bush. At the second bush, step left out of the corner, around the arete, and onto a narrow ramp that leads up and left underneath a double-tiered, clean white roof - this is the \"Gottlieb Variation\" (recommended) - the original route continues all the way up to the top of the corner. Climb through the center of the clean white roof at a thin crack and pull up to a long, shale-filled horizontal. Traverse straight left for 25' in this horizontal to a series of huge, frightening, stacked blocks. Gingerly climb up over these and belay on a small ledge at the base of a large, clean right-facing corner capped by a massive roof. This is a long pitch and to do it without rope drag one must runner their gear extremely well. Otherwise an intermediate belay may be required. Also, despite guidebook descriptions, the Gottlieb Variation is well-protected and only about 5.9. All in all, this pitch checks in at mid-5.10 and possibly R due to loose rock, but there is adequate pro. \n\n  P2: Climb up the corner above and undercling and crimp rightwards around the roof. It may be best to use extra long runners here or back clean all of this gear to eliminate rope drag on the crux. Continue up flakey rock to an incut slot (crucial large nut and/or 1\" cam - Red Alien or 0.5 Camalot is perfect). Get ready: Bust a series of powerful moves on great side pulls to gain a hanging corner with a thin crack and more gear. A fall from here would be massive, but if you miss the small slab it would be otherwise clean. If you hit the slab... well... it could be 5.11 R, but it's hard to say. The important consideration is you're doing the crux of the whole climb pretty far out (10+ feet) from your last pieces. Once in the corner, arrange great gear and work up to the next roof, traverse left out the roof and around an incredibly exposed arete. Continue up another corner and once again work left out the roof and around another, even more exposed arete. Continue up the final corner and mantle over the top onto pine needles and duff. All of the climbing post-crux is well protected. 5.11b-ish, R-ish.","protection":"Single set from 0.33\" (Black Alien/00 C3) to #2 Camalot, doubles of the small stuff, a set of wires, plenty of slings.

Many consider it to be the Gunks' best cliff, but I think that depends on what you're looking for -- if it's fantastic views, no crowds, great climbing (although characteristically run out), a sense of commitment, and adventure in general, then you will not be disappointed.\n\n \"The Bank\" was the first cliff climbed in the Gunks, via \"The Old Route,\" by Fritz Wiessner in 1935. It's rated 5.5 and I've heard it's pretty chossy, but Millbrook isn't for sissies after all. Other \"must do's\" include Westward Ha! (5.7), Cruise Control (5.9), Time Eraser (10a), High Plains Drifter (10+), New Frontier (11-), and Nectar Vector (12+), along with a few others that, by tradition, aren't talked about too often. Millbrook has more than 80 routes ranging in length from 130 to 200 feet.\n\n The wall is generally dead vertical, and the white quartzite that it is composed of yields a slightly different climbing experience than the Trapps or the Nears. One interesting point to consider is that the climbs are typically approached via double-rope raps from above. This will not take you to the bottom of the cliff, but will instead land you on a \"GT Ledge\" of sorts. This ledge ranges from 2-20' wide, and the climbs begin from this point. This ledge is very different from its extension across the Trapps;  in Millbrook, it is often quite sloping and covered in loose pebbles - you generally cannot plan to walk on it. Also notable is that due to its \"remote\" location, rescue is much further away, and you may not be near other climbers. Due to lower traffic, you should be prepared to deal with loose rock.\n\n Access:  All of the cliff lies on private property. The Mohonk Preserve is the only entity that explicitly allows climbing, and they only own the top of the north half of Millbrook, but none of the cliff itself.\n\n For more on Millbrook, don't miss local climber Christian Fracchia's site WhiteCliff, where he provides excellent topos, photos, and select route descriptions. Christian is one of the Millbrook locals who you might contact to show you around, in the old tradition."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":22,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:11.550Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:18.196Z"}
