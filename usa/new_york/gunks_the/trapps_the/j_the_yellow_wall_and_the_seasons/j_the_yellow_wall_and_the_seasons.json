I'm inclined to agree.  It is awesome. \n\n  The Yellow Wall area is just right of Bonnie's Roof, and is easily identified as a towering, yellow, tidal wave of rock.  The climb begins from a large pile of boulders (these boulders are about 100' right of Silly Chimney) - you can scramble to the top of these from either side and there's a nice belay area there. \n\n  The route was originally done in three pitches, but is best done as two, and if done in one, is absolutely amazing (as long as you're very careful about rope drag). \n\n  P1:  Start up a right-facing corner, step around the corner to the left, and face climb up to a stance at a pin (may be missing -- see comments) and horizontal.  Belay here, or, if you were able to run it out to this point without gear, continue on.  60', traditionally rated 5.8 but I think it's more like 5.6. \n\n  P2: Climb up off the belay (PG) to a fixed pin which can be backed up with a wire. Step left and pull a roof at a modern bolt (put an extra long runner on this bolt or you will experience lots of rope drag, or, consider skipping it (dangerous), or back-cleaning it.  Face climb back right to a second bolt under the \"Mummy Roof\" -- so named because it resembles a sarcophagus from below.  Place the #3 Camalot and pull this roof (5.11c crux, with perfect beta it may feel easier, without the beta it may feel impossible).  Climb up and left (PG) to a possible belay in the Mummy Cave.  This was the original belay when done as three pitches, but do NOT belay here - if you blow the second crux you will factor 2 on the anchor.  Place gear and reach up to a hollow flake (please consider not placing pro here - the flake is a crucial hold and has already broken once) over the roof, lieback and step up to a stance in the corner.  Have your partner give you a bunch of slack here so if you fall you will drop into space below the Mummy Roof.  This is rated 11b or c, but is probably 11-/10+.  Climb delicately up the corner (PG13) to a crucial Yellow Alien/0.5 Camalot placement. Turn the arete to the right, and hand traverse 25-30' on easier climbing to a great belay stance (natural gear) at the top of the wall. \n\n  It's worthwhile to note that if the second falls off of this climb at certain points, it will be impossible to get back on (the falls are safe for the second, however).  Additionally, if the second falls at the crux, the rope can be abraded by dragging across the lip of the roof. \n\n  Descend from a rap station 100' climber's left from the top out.  Two 35-meter raps (a 60m involves some downclimbing); or use the old school descent, the chimney just left of the route (Silly Chimney).","protection":"Standard Rack.

After climbing it at my suggestion, one of them said he would rather go bouldering than be subjected to it again. Strong words! And he is not alone - you can find similar comments posted on message boards by other nattering nabobs of negativity.\n\n But don't let all the bad press dissuade you. Ventre de Boeuf has a lot going for it -- it's unique at the Gunks, it's got a lot of varied climbing packed into a single pitch, a very unusual and thoughtful (and physical!) crux, and there's never a line.

The start is a few feet to the right of that crack. (If you want a direct start at 10d, climb the offwidth crack. If you don't, there is no off-width technique required on the rest of the route.)\n\n Face climb up about 20' to a small overhang, and then make a somewhat committing traverse up and left into the wide crack. A large cam (#3.5 or #4 Camalot) is helpful when you reach the crack. By this point you will have experienced the route's one drawback: a green dust coating the lower half of the route. As long it hasn't rained recently, it's not too bad.\n\n Continue up the crack, past some protruding flakes into an alcove. You can get a no-hands rest here while considering the crux, which requires making your way out to the light about 10', and then up through a narrow V-notch to slings around a tree.

Reach the anchor and rap.  \n\n  A note from Ivan Rezucha:  I did what I thought was the FA on aid in the mid '70s. Dick Williams says it was done earlier by Dennis Mehmet & co., but I'm a little skeptical, as there were no pin scars. But perhaps in the hard Gunks rock, one aid ascent wouldn't leave any scars. \n\n  My \"FA\" was done as a self-belay, on all nuts, with hooks. At one point I did 3 hook moves in a row, with 2 hooks, by hanging on some small free holds as I moved a hook up. That was pretty exciting. I was either self-belaying with prussiks, or maybe I had moved up by then to jumars. \n\n  My name for the climb, \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\", came from this story: Jeff Pofit attempted (what we thought was) the second ascent. He didn't know that I had used hooks. He ripped his gear from the crux aid section, where the arch jogs right, and zippered a bunch of other gear due to the sideways pull caused by arching. He landed on his head at a soft spot between some rocks. I think he was carried away, but he would have been able to walk away. \n\n  The original route went right at the top of the arch to a platform on the arete, and then angled left and up on some nice free climbing at about 5.8. My understanding is that Hugh Herr & co. free-climbed the final traverse right to the arete, but that most people end the free climbing by exiting left near the top of the arch.
