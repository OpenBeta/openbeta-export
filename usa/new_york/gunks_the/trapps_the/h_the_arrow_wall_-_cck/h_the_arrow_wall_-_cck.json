The other pitches are basically contrived squeeze jobs to stay off the arrow line (or they are directly on the Arrow line, like p2).  Pitch three (5.9, 80 ft.) is practically within arm's reach of arrow (5-10 feet left), and IMHO provides Dick William's commentary on the old Arrow right or left finish controversy. \n\n  Pitch 1 (100 feet, 5.8):  The gray Dick states that it shares a start with Easy V.  If leading, I would recommend starting here as the gear is much better.  If on TR, it's more difficult and fun to start left of the Easy V start, but right of the start of Arrow.  A few feet right of the little tree growing out of the ledges that serve as the standard Arrow start will put you in the right place.  This pitch is nice face climbing with some horizontal ridges and cracks.  Grey Dick ends the pitch at the top of Easy V, but I recommend keeping the line straight to maintain the difficulty.  Once again, I believe DW's suggestion will give you better gear options.  Belay from the GT ledge either way. \n\n  Pitch 2 (30 feet, 5.7):  Walk left on the GT ledge until you arrive at the start of Arrow's second pitch.  Make your way, angling right, through the overhangs.  The grey Dick has you stopping to belay once the overhangs are over.  If you have a new second, this might not be a bad idea.  Otherwise, it's much easier to link p2 and p3. \n\n  Pitch 3 (70 feet, 5.9):  The start is more or less the same as the Arrow line after the overhangs.  You can force yourself slightly left, but some of the moves overlap, in my opinion.  For the crux moves, stay left.  I think this is where the difference in Dick William's suggested ratings come from.  A lot of climbers feel the left side finish is harder than the right side finish on Arrow.  Rating this 5.9 over Arrow's 5.8 supports that. \n\n  Descent: Arrow rappel","protection":"Grey Dick calls it PG.

This is about 15' right of a large block leaning against the wall (Three Doves).\n\n P1: Climb 40' up a runout slab (5.4 R) to a left-facing corner capped by a small overhang. Turn the overhang, continue up past the right side of a scary block, and angle back left past dirty ledges to the obvious ledge. Belay at any of several big trees. 5.8, 100'.\n\n P1 (variations): Climb the first pitch of Three Doves, Limelight, or Arrow to get to the same ledge. (Recommended).\n\n P2: Start by scrambling up some left-facing flakes. The wall steepens here and the climbing gets harder. Climb up the face, following the path of least resistance, traversing right under a shallow overhang, where the scary loose block discussed below used to be (it fell in Nov. 2012). Continue up the bright white face above, with several thin 5.8 moves. At the final roof, either exit right onto Limelight, or move left to a groove near the top of the wall. Make an awkward exit move up the groove to a bolt anchor at the top. 5.8+, 100'.\n\n Descent: Rap from the bolt anchor back to the GT Ledge (one 60m rope, but watch the ends). Downclimb to the big tree with rap slings. Rap 100' to the ground with a 60m rope.","protection":"Standard rack with emphasis on small pro.  Small cams useful for the first pitch.
