Instant Classic. Stand start with left hand on head height edge and right hand on a lower two finger pocket. Climb shallow pockets up and then go big for an edge on the slopey top. Move up and left to another edge before topping out. Be careful of breaking (chossy) feet at the start.NOTE: There are lower edges that could make a sit or lower start possible. That was too tough for us, so that project has yet to be done.","protection":"2 pads will help. The landing is clear but on a slope. Use two pads to create a flat landing zone.","location":"This boulder and climb are visible from the parking lot at the Blue Mountain Summit Trail Head, across from Lounsbury Pond. From the parking lot, walk up a steep hill located to the right of the trail head. Go up about 50 meters and you are there!Â "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,589a474a-bbce-5213-a77d-8138a22e0474,4a77cac3-e1cb-57e5-bdba-58551644312c,8b93629c-b1fe-5665-b578-4e803e60fa2f","pathTokens":["USA","New York","Blue Mountain Park","Free Parking Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.92141,41.26962]},"bbox":[-73.92200825946972,41.26917033981814,-73.92081174053027,41.27006966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121844712","area_id":"i5NinLH+VmW1eE6APmD6Lw=="},"content":{"description":"This boulder is visible from the parking lot at the Blue Mountain Trail Head.
