The rock quality is good, both still need to get the slippery lichen cleaned off. It is fairly secluded. One boulder can be seen from the trail, the other outcrop is about 25 feet to the left. These boulders dry quickly.  \n\n  We have done the really easy, small boulder. V easy. Done bare footed. There is a sloper traverse around the easy boulder. V0+. When you are there,to your left is an outcropping. Go down the hill. Starting the the far left of the overhang you will see chalk in a finger slot. Traverse across, hitting a small jug and then heinous slopers. Heel hook and bump your way to the big sloper. On top is a little indent where you can fit about three fingers. It has to be brushed off, because soft, slippery lichen is on top. Far out is a jug that is really hard to get to. This is the crux of the problem. Dan and I have not finished it yet, so it's a project. It is probably V5 without the lichen."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:07.279Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:42.401Z"}
