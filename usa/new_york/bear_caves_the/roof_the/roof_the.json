Sit start and make your way out and right on pockets, crimps and such. Pull the roof, establish on the lip and top out on the right hand arete (don't miss the glory jug).\n\n This is a super good line. The movement is awesome and everything is there. And the topout is pretty cool. I don't climb at the Bear Caves often, I was just passing through when I put this up. But if someone else has done this already please let me know. I saw no evidence of prior cleaning or chalk and so assumed that it was an FA. Also, feel free to share your opinions on grade. I have bouldered mostly in the SE and am comparing it to those grades.","protection":"a few pads, maybe a spotter for topout","location":"Sit start way back in there."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,589a474a-bbce-5213-a77d-8138a22e0474,85090770-b542-50c6-86a5-8066bb9ed2d8,050e3ee5-ab5d-57a4-b721-5131ee4d3c70","pathTokens":["USA","New York","Bear Caves, The","Roof, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.79416,42.00856]},"bbox":[-78.79476515887096,42.00811033981813,-78.79355484112907,42.00900966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117556150","area_id":"BQ4+5atdV6S3IVEx7k08cA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-78.79476515887096,42.00811033981813],[-78.79355484112907,42.00811033981813],[-78.79355484112907,42.00900966018186],[-78.79476515887096,42.00900966018186],[-78.79476515887096,42.00811033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"A large roof towards the end of the right side of the main cliff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:15:02.790Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:06.646Z"}
