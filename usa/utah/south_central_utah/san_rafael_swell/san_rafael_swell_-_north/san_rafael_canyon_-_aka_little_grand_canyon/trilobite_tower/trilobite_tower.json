There is not much size variation on this pitch.  140' 5.12+/13- or C1.  Belay at two bolts on a small ledge.\n\nP2 - Climb the chimney to a great ledge with two bolts.  A chockstone is slung at the start, and some gear can be placed in cracks within the chimney.  80' 5.9\n\nP3 - Climb a 3 bolt ladder to some free climbing, and then another 10 bolt or so ladder to the summit.  The bolt ladder has a lot of face features and should also go free, though some bolts may need to be repositioned(oops).  130' 5.9 C1.\n\nDescent - Rap to the top of P2 with a single 70m rope, and then rap to the ground with a 70m double rope rap.  Without 70m ropes, make a double rope rap to the top of P2 and maybe even P1(don't know for sure), single rope rap to the top of P1, and then double rope rap to the ground.","protection":"Every .5 camalot you can get - at least 6.  4 .75 camalots, 2-3 sets of yellow and red aliens.  1-2 sets of everything else.  Big cams optional but potentially useful to sew up the free climbing on P3.\n\nTo free climb P1, the suggested rack is:\n\n2 x .4 camalots\n\n11x .5 camalots\n\n10x .75 camalots\n\n1x 1 camalot\n\nSome webbing would be good to extend the summit anchors.  They are currently Metolius rap hangers, but it wasn't an easy pull.  If you don't have a 70m line you will absolutely have to extend the anchor since a knot surely won't pull.","location":"Start up the obvious splitter .5 camalot crack."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,9bf51fb3-0d43-5641-89fd-03339c190ee7,9fa6ddbf-8139-5a55-af7d-3098ca8a6289","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","San Rafael Canyon - AKA Little Grand Canyon","Trilobite Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.73262,39.0935]},"bbox":[-110.73319937093436,39.093050339818134,-110.73204062906562,39.093949660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107836516","area_id":"n6bdv4E5WlWvfTCYyopiiQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:31.608Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:14.103Z"}
