A cleaner and easier looking first pitch was seen when the FA party rapped off and was climbed by the second ascent party, though sadly it was buried by rockfall. These will be both shown on a photo of the tower.\n\nOriginal start P1) Climb the groove past two bolts to the shoulder area below the twin towers to double anchors on the left side of the ledge. 100' 5.8 C1.\n\nP1A) An easier and safer first pitch was located on the north side. Scramble under a chockstone to a 5.10 or C1 finger crack that widens to an offwidth and then a 5.8 chimney capped by a small roof. Scramble easily to the anchor after pulling over the roof.Â  Unfortunately this pitch was obliterated by a huge rockfall.\n\nP2) Climb intermittent cracks in the center of the rock leading up to the gap between the two towers. 70' 5.8 C1.\n\nP3) Follow about 4 to 5 drilled angles to a ramp leading to the right edge, then two more angles to a fine summit and register in cairn. 70' 5.8 C1.\n\nRap the route. From the shoulder rap straight down from the anchors.","protection":"Normal desert rack of cams and stoppers. One 60m rope","location":"From the junction of the North Coal Wash Road and the Devils Racetrack, drive a few miles to the base of the very obvious tower.  From here it is a short 10 minute walk to the foot of the tower.

New style 4 camalots are especially useful.\n\nThe anchor is a little shaky - good rock is hard to find up there.  We didn't have any luck getting bolts to tighten down well.  I'd recommend bringing some half inchers up or adding a drilled angle.  We didn't die rapping off so I guess its all right.","location":"Mueller Tower is in a side drainage north of the wash about 2-3 miles past the junction of the north and south Coal Wash roads and just before Mirage Tower briefly comes in to view.

The rock is soft Wingate typical in this part of the swell.\n\nP1) Start right of some really neat tree roots that drape down the wall.  Climb 25' of hard to protect 5.8 face climbing to a large ledge system.  Wander to the end of the ledge system, go up a 5.4 ramp, and then back right to a 2 bolt belay at the base of the splitter.  70 feet of climbing to gain about 30 feet of vertical.  5.8 kinda Rish - falling on the opening moves is a bad idea.\n\nP2) Start up a tips dihedral to a shallow chimney past 4 bolts until a lovely fingercrack is reached.  Follow the fingercrack to a stance with a 2 bolt belay.  80 feet, C2.  This would be an excellent free pitch in the 5.11/5.12 range - there are lots of face features in the bolted opening section.\n\nP3) Climb past 2 bolts to a long handcrack that gets weird when it jogs to the left past 2 more bolts to the summit ridge of the tower.  110 feet C2. This will be an excellent free pitch in the 5.11 range.\n\nP4) A drilled angle protects a boulder problem overhang on bad rock to an easy scramble to the summit.  The summit is 20 feet of class 3 scrambling past the anchor.  25 feet, and  probably 5.9 or 5.10 on bad rock to free, but an aider on the drilled angle makes it easy.\n\nTo descend, do a short rap to the top of P3.  We rapped to the ground with 2 70 meter ropes.  Future parties could rap the route with a single 70 meter line if they bring some webbing/rings for the intermediate anchors.\n\nPitches 2 and 3 could be easily combined into a very long pitch - they take completely different gear so the rack size wouldn't change, and the stance at the top of P2 is fairly uncomfortable.\n\nThis would be an excellent free climb now that the bolts are in - the gear is good and there are lots of face features.","protection":"5-6 sets of .4 through 2 camalots.  2-3 sets of smaller cams down to green alien, and 2-3 sets of 3 camalots.  1 set of old style 3.5, 4, and 4.5 camalots.","location":"The impressive narrow aspect of Mirage Tower is briefly visible a mile or two before the Devils Racetrack turnoff on North Coal Wash Road, and also from Joe and His Dog.  It disappears into the cliffside as you drive past it unless you know exactly where it is even though there is a 500' gap between the tower and the wall, which lead to the name.  It is a 250' high narrow fin, and has a few other appealing lines for the adventurous.\n\nTo approach, look for a wooden fence on the north side of the road where the road temporarily splits into two tracks shortly before the Devils Racetrack turnoff.  Begin on a marked trail for a short distance, but stay in the wash when the trail goes right up a hill.  Follow the wash moving up onto its left shoulder when necessary until below the base of the tower.  Head up to the right side of the tower, and then keep traversing high along the base of the north face of the tower until reaching the route.   This is much easier than going left around the tower and trudging up a soft dirt and talus slope..  The hike is pleasant and takes about 20 minutes from the car."},"__v":0},{"_id":"+2TqneR5UKu4DZ2M20sPcg==","name":"Joe and His Dog - His Dog Tower","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Ben Folsom, Andrew Gram 11/20/2015","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.88859,38.98344]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"111336022","mp_crag_id":"106149971","climb_id":"+2TqneR5UKu4DZ2M20sPcg==","areaRef":"BuqRKOt1Ur6vZ/iVZXLsuQ=="},"content":{"description":"His Dog is an adventurous tower route. The tower is very narrow and has cracks you can see through even at the base.\n\nP1) Aid up a crack to a 4 bolt ladder to an awkward bulging crack.

Park where the wash from the side canyon hits the road.\n\nHike up the side canyon, and just before it cliffs out trudge up a dirt and talus slope on the right.  Pick your way up the side canyon, eventually reaching the left side of it and going up the first side canyon on the left.  Scramble easily out of the canyon onto a broad plateau, and hike cross country to the talus cone.  An easy scramble exists starting below His Dog and working left near the top.  Make sure to note where you exit the side canyon onto the plateau since it isn't all that obvious on the way back down.\n\nHis Dog is the tower on the right, and looks like a dog sitting down.\n\nThe hike in takes about an hour and is really beautiful.
