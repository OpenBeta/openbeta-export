Now traverse around the large formation to its left passing walls to the far end.  Hike around the end of the walls, and then traverse back around the south side now heading south towards the north side of the Sphinx.  Scramble up ledges on the east side of the Sphinx, then along ledges to the right to reach the foot of the ridge and the start of the climb.\n\nThe hiking descent from the Sphinx is shorter than the approach.  After the climb head south towards the parking area that will be in view to a narrow gully above a black wall of smooth rock.  Here are rap anchors.  Rap down 80' then head down and across left(east), and after about a quarter mile one will locate the top of an open gully.  Head down this and then more easy walking back to the parking area."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,4db534af-4914-5319-9d9e-5e5a00ab5771","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Calf Mesa"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.66498,39.07827]},"bbox":[-110.66555924585462,39.077820339818146,-110.66440075414536,39.07871966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105803675","area_id":"TbU0r0kUUxmdnl5aAKtXcQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.66555924585462,39.077820339818146],[-110.66440075414536,39.077820339818146],[-110.66440075414536,39.07871966018187],[-110.66555924585462,39.07871966018187],[-110.66555924585462,39.077820339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:31.609Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:41.207Z"}
