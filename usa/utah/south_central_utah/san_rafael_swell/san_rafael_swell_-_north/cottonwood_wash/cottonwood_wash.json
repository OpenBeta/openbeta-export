Sections of bullet hard stone tolerate bomber protection, leading to stone where the protection is questionable. The route in its entirety is very fun!","protection":"There is one bolt at the beginning of the route to protect some delicate face moves before the crack system. Master Cams #0 - #2 are very useful.

About a 15 segment before getting in to solid Sandstone. Small nuts worked well for protection through this section.\n\nThe Route follows a great line and will test all your crack climbing skills. The first pitch is mostly hands and off hands. The climbing is about 5.9. A top of pitch one is a hanging belay.\n\nPitch two is exciting and super exposed, starting off with fingers, to hands, to off fingers, and then things get wide. A short offwidth to a chimney takes you to a set of anchors. Off fingers and tricky smearing will get you through the crux.\n\nTwo 60M cords will get you down.","protection":"Pitch one is 2\"-4\"pieces and a few small nuts.

The second pitch offwidth will get you heart going. If you like offwidth climbs this is a must do. The second pitch is also the crux pitch.\n\nThe first pitch is 5.6 and leads to a two bolt anchor.

Once you gain the top there is another two bolt anchor and a beautiful view of Cottonwood Wash.","protection":"There are two bolt anchors on each pitch. The first pitch requires 1\"- 4\" pieces.

The first half of the route is trad. The route starts on a low angle slab transitioning into vertical terrain relatively quickly. The crack is straight forward, not to difficult and takes gear well. The route transitions into a groove after about 50 of climbing that does not yield pro so, its protected by bolts. At this point the route is significantly steeper. This is probably the crux of the route. Small shallow pockets in the groove, solid edges and some delicate foot work will lead to a two bolt anchor exactly 100 of the deck.","protection":"Tricams 1.5 - 2.5 are useful for the start. I would recommend small to medium nuts, TCUs or Master Cams #0 -#4, and Camalots .4 - #3. A #4 Camalot (Optional) might be useful to protect the transition from the crack to the groove depending on how willing the leader is to run it out before reaching the first bolt. The groove is protected by 6 bolts and a 2 bolt anchor at the top. 1 60M cord will do.","location":"The route is located just 5 - 10 minutes from the Cottonwood Wash pull out on the south side of the canyon; Left side of the river bed if youre facing up canyon.
