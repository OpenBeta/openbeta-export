It follows a beautiful crack system straight up for three great pitches with a short, chossy 4th-class scramble to the summit.\n\nPitch 1: Climb a sandy handcrack aiming for splitter roof. Stem out past the wild thin-hands roof crack and pull into the \"Banana Splitter\" an arching finger-and-hand crack for 30'. Reach another roof and undercling/layback left, up into a crack system and belay below a weird inverted v-slot. Save a couple hand-size cams for this belay and you'll be happy.175' 5.11-\n\nPitch 2: The BIZZNESS! climb up through the v-slot, strenuous 5.10, then breathe deep and send the overhanging fingers in the corner above. Pass one great rest, into thin hands and a large belay ledge, with a cave just above. I can't say enough good things about this pitch, simply spectacular!!! 100' 5.11++\n\nPitch 3: Pull a weird thin move into the cave 10+,and figure out the offwidth/fistcrack roof out of it. Follow this crack with hands to a ledge, and climb a huge thin flake 5.8 towards some horrid loose shit. CAREFULLY stem around the loose blocks (5.9), marginal gear below (save a #3 or #4 Camalot for just below this section) and pull on to a large ledge PHEW! 125' 5.11- (note rap anchors here)\n\nNow leave the rack and scramble gingerly up to the cool summit. There is an interesting summit register up there to check out. The raps are fairly straightforward: three double raps down from the top of pitch 3, toward the west, and down the Langdon route.\n\nA great obscure tower route, well done by Pennings and the late Doug Hall.","protection":"There are no fixed anchors or gear on this route so keep that in mind for the rack.bring two sets of cams to 3 inches, and extra fingers, extra thin hands, and one or two 4 inch pieces.two sixty meter ropes to rappel.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,44c58cbe-9fee-597b-85da-4006d51b63d9","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Bottleneck Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.68105,39.06824]},"bbox":[-110.68162916353286,39.067790339818146,-110.68047083646711,39.06868966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717200","area_id":"RMWMvp/uWXuF2kAG1Rtj2Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.68162916353286,39.067790339818146],[-110.68047083646711,39.067790339818146],[-110.68047083646711,39.06868966018186],[-110.68162916353286,39.06868966018186],[-110.68162916353286,39.067790339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:31.613Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:41.309Z"}
