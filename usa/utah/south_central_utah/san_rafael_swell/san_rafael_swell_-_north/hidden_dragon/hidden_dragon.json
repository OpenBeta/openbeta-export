Consider one of two single pitch routes on the north face accessed via a ledge from the east – a clean-looking, blue-collar OW (requires some big gear, est ~5.10) or an amazing finger crack (first half tricky to protect, est 5.11). This route begins on the furthest east portion of the 1,500-foot long ridge making up The Hidden Dragon.\n\nClimb up a sandy terrace to a ledge with an angling crack going up and left. Follow the crack left which is the crux (scary and loose but takes some pro). Continue up easier terrain to a super chossy band. Then traverse left on very sandy exposed holds to a Hilti screw anchor (we didn't place and I recommend replacing to a proper 5-piece sleeve bolt anchor.) The traverse is scary for both the leader and follower.\n\nThen romp west up the narrow and exposed slickrock ridge to summit block (class 3-4). A final un-roped scramble (class 4) up the summit block leads to the tippy-top. The views are A+!","protection":"Single rack, 2X BD C4 #4s","location":"East side of the fin."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,78b9da82-41fd-508d-9fea-8d4910573c90","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Hidden Dragon"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.42613,38.97238]},"bbox":[-110.42670837882906,38.97193033981814,-110.42555162117091,38.972829660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120416889","area_id":"eLnagkH9UI2f6o1JEFc8kA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:31.607Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:28.528Z"}
