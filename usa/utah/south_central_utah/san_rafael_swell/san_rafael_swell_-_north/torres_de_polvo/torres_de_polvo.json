When you see the beautiful splitter crack, you may want to attempt the route free.  As the crack cleans up, I have no doubt that this could be accomplished.  It is slightly overhanging near the top.\n\nThis route climbs the obvious crack on the north side of the tower.  I stopped to check out the tower when I saw the very obvious crack that splits the west side of the formation, but on closer inspection realized that this is an offwidth.  The crack that Virgin Roadtrip follows can not be seen from the interstate.\n\nFollow three bolts to the obvious crack.  Climb the crack to the top and a two bolt anchor.  The very top is a boulder move on loose dirt (literally) above the anchor.  (I used an ice axe to gain that perch, but I was not brave enough to stand up and walk around... but then again, I was alone.)","protection":"1-red (size 1) camalot, 1 yellow (size 2)camalot, 2 or 3 blue (size 3) camalots, 2 or 3 gray (size 3.5) camalots.","location":"You could park your vehicle on the interstate, hop the fence and walk to the tower.  Or, my approach, take exit 108, head north until you come to a wash.  Take a right into the wash and drive until you come to another wash on your left.

It inexplicably became the subject of attention in 2016, but should fade back into obscurity after early November.  The rock has so little integrity that it is mostly just dirt, and crumbles under the slightest pressure.\n\nStart in a dirty, dirty groove, pop a couple of tic tacs, and then grope your way past three bolts before heaving onto the summit.\n\nBe careful - the rock is probably the worst i've ever climbed in the desert.\n\nSad!","protection":"3 bolts and a .75 camalot to protect the final mantel onto the summit.\n\nThe anchor took quite a bit of excavation before any ok rock was found.  It'll likely be buried, but hopefully chains and a summit register will be visible.","location":"Take the Lone Tree exit from I70, drive south a short distance to a T junction, turn left, and park just before the dirt road dead ends at a fence.

Otherwise, it is pretty much a waste of your time, unless you like short approaches and want something to do as you are driving by on I-70.  Topping out will wake you up, if you choose to do so.\n\nThis route climbs the left tower as you are looking south from the interstate.  It follows a line that allows you to be seen by all passing traffic.\n\nStart by climbing up a dirty, ramp/chimney (5.4ish or less).  Then follow approximately 8 bolts (4 or 5 hangerless) to the top.  The top is pretty much just loose dirt w/some grass.\n\nFrom the top, downclimb the route via the last two bolts to a two bolt anchor in good rock.

The capstone is pretty junky.)","protection":"Wire nuts, or the like, to sling the hangerless bolts.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,9febc273-7a44-51ce-b933-be7bc8f641bb","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Torres de Polvo"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.05279,38.8464]},"bbox":[-111.05336735324626,38.84595033981814,-111.05221264675374,38.84684966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105883143","area_id":"n+vCc3pEUc65M757yPZBuw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:31.051Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:28.267Z"}
