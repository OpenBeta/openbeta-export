From the Lone Rock-Point 6,333 saddle, hike in a circle to the northwest side of Point 6,333. Expect sidehilling, talus, hard pan and other typical desert mountaineering shenanigans to get to the base of the route. The climbing quality isn't great but the adventure, views and uniqueness of the route make this a fantastic roundabout.\n\nPitch 1:\n\nStart up the lowest angle slab on the northwest side of the butte. Climb some exciting but easy slab to a small saddle.\n\n5.6, ~70 feet.\n\nPitch 2:\n\nTraverse east on an exposed loose class 3 ledge to a large obvious chimney. Climb through some precarious blocks to stance inside of the chimney. Rope drag would be horrendous if you continue too far into the chimney.\n\n5.2, ~70 feet.\n\nPitch 3:\n\n“The Canyoneering Cave Pitch.” Continue up the chimney to a dark corridor. Then stem/traverse (~60 feet) across a semi-bottomless chasm in the corridor until it's feasible to chimney/corkscrew out of the corridor to ledge.\n\n5.4, ~80-100 feet\n\nPitch 4:\n\nCycle around, walk back west, and step across the corridor to mantle up a crack which reaches the top of the mesa. A short twisty walk through some small benches leads to the summit with astonishing views.\n\n5.4, ~50 feet.\n\nDescent\n\n: Down-climb pitches 4-2 to the top of pitch 1. Rappel from a block (not-that-great) back to the base of the slab.","protection":"Single rack, runners and a single 60M rope","location":"Northwest side of Point 6,333."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,db1396cd-3e64-5ef8-a738-9c70326769da,16f84bbd-58cc-52b9-bcca-b7bb5550196a","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Mexican Mountain Road Area","Point 6,333"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.50274,39.02769]},"bbox":[-110.50331883113576,39.02724033981814,-110.50216116886426,39.02813966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118037038","area_id":"FvhLvVjMUrm8yre7VVAZag=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:31.611Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:13.864Z"}
