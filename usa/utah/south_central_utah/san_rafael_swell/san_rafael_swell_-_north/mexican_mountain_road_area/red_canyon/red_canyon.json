We forgot the drill kit so we simulrapped but we plan on putting some rap anchors on the climb.","location":"Head into\n\nRed Canyon\n\n.

Hike in past the wilderness study area signs along a pleasant wash for about 2 miles, (about an hour) to an obvious break in the crappy brown rockbands.\n\nHike onto the bench and head slightly south to a game track that leads towards the obvious connected towers.
