Other right facing dihedrals may be present, but this one starts almost at the lowest point and a bolt may be noticed quite low down on the first pitch where it was used to get up a blankish section and into the dihedral.\n\nPitch #1: Climb to the bolt and trend right around a roof to a two-bolt belay. 5.9+, 40m.\n\nPitch #2: An ugly chimney crack in the dihedral was avoided by easy Aid to the right and then returning left to the dihedral. A 1\" (hard or C1) crack in the dihedral coninues straight up and into a loose band until one soon reaches another two-bolt belay. 5.9+, A1-C1, 50m.\n\nPitch #3: Continue up the dihedral and some wideness and some scrambling to a two-bolt belay. 5.9, C1. 40m.\n\nPitch #4: Pass a bolt (a one move wonder) and easier climbing to the very top of the tower. 5.8, 15m.\n\nThis is a late entry of a route that has until now never been recorded. I think it will provide someone a great adventure, and especially if they set out to do the FFA.
