There is a pullout on the west side of the road a little way past the tower.  To breach the chinle hike up the wash (along the chinle) to the west of the pullout until an easy scramble is reached.The route begins on the north side of the tower in a handcrack and winds left around to the south side and a big ledge.  The crack gets progressively larger as it curves around the tower.  There is an optional belay with three good bolts at approximately 75'.  The final pitch is a bolt ladder up the south face (10 or 11 clips).  There is a whole slew of bolts at the top offering several descent options.  With two ropes it is one rappel to the ground off the east side.  With one rope it would be two or three raps.","protection":"Camalots 1-4 or 4.5, one set should suffice, two #3 would be useful.
