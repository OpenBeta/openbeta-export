As far as a \"hand crack\" goes, either Kent has hulk hands or the pillar shifted... or perhaps the name was established to entice future ascents.

You can break the pitch up here or climb the entire thing in one go. For one long pitch, you might want to beef up the rack depending on what you use on the approach pitch (see gear notes below).\n\nLower section (5.8, ~35 feet): begin in a left facing corner with a finger crack in the back. Make easy moves up and through a few bulges. At the top, the rock quality in the corner deteriorates - pick a line up and over the face to the belay shelf above. Build an anchor or continue up from here.\n\nUpper section (5.10, ~95 feet): Step off the nice shelf and climb ~40 feet of perfect splitter in a beautiful handcrack (3s & 4s).\n\nNavigate a wide pod and then jog left as the crack narrows down and the angle eases off. Make delicate moves using the crack and face features to move left and up to the anchor bolts.\n\nNote: You can combine the lower & upper section with an 80m. If doing so, tie a knot because itâ€™ll stretch you right to the end of the rope. And if you climb it in two pitches with a 70m, after pulling the rope from the upper portion there is an easy scramble down to the true base by walking climbers left off the belay ledge.","protection":"Gear for lower section: .5, #1, 2x #2, optional #5.\n\nGear for upper section:\n\n-Singles .2-.4, #5\n\n-Doubles .5-#2,\n\n-Triples: #3 & #4","location":"This pitch is on the east-facing wall around the corner (climbers left) of Kent's Hand Crack."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,74906d35-9873-5e60-a707-98956a7c83be,3e823640-b736-5565-aa09-6d973c60d0ea,756916fa-1e5b-5fa0-b3a3-ac024bc32c0d","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Buckhorn Wash","Lower Buckhorn","Kent's Hand Crack"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.66597,39.09553]},"bbox":[-110.66654938761337,39.09508033981813,-110.66539061238664,39.09597966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119705101","area_id":"dWkW+h5bX6Czo6wCS8MsDQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:32.511Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:29.918Z"}
