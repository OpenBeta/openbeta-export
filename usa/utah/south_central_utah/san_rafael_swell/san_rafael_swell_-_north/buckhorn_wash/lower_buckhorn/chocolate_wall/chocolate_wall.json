The route is easily visible from BWR as the prominent splitter facing the road on the dark face.The approach from the BWR is straighforward and takes about five to ten minutes.A very diverse route starting with 20' of 5.8 offwidth with protection in the crack behind.  This gives way to some excellent small hands in the back of a V-pod and finishes with fingers or laybacking.
