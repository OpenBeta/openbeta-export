You climb through it and then to the ledge on the left. From here you can see a left side corner on your right, but it's easier to reach it from left. Continue up to the end of the corner, then turn left to the anchor (2 bolts).\n\nPitch 2: Starts with a fist crack on the right, continues with an offwidth/chimney, then through a window. Continue with another chimney, then left over the slabs. Belay on the big ledge.\n\nPitch 3: Climb a second dihedral on the right (very sandy). Belay on the big rock under a corner.\n\nPitch 4: Climb a corner to the ledge. Go left and climb a nice hand crack to the top.\n\nDescent: Right along the ledge, scramble down to the easier slabs.

From there, the crack widens and the rock turns sandy.  Pull into the off-width and get a knee in.  Take a breath, for it's about to get \"fun\".  Pull into the last crack system, grab some edges on the face and climb to the sub par pockets and dirty crack.   5 more feet of easy climbing to the top.  Anchors are a power draw a quickdraw.\n\nBe very careful pulling your rope.  The crack system likes to suck it in.\n\nI didn't have a brush to clean the top on the tower.  The bottom is great and didn't need any cleaning at all, except for a little blowing off holds.\n\nPlacements are scary up high because of the quality of the rock, but as long as you have the gear...","protection":"Standard desert rack with extras of .25 - .75.

You can either approach it form the approach pitch of Haagenschlong and walk past the chimney pitch and turn left up another slot.  This is the tower and the route starts right after you come out of the slot.\n\nOr you can scramble up the south side of the cliff.  To scramble, park at the start of the Pine Canyon road and walk north toward Haagenschlong taking a less steep approach, climb some loose rock to a platform.
