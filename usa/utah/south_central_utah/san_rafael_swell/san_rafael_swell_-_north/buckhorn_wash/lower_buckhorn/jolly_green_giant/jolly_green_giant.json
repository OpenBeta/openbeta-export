Continue up the slab past another glue-in to a chain anchor.\n\nA slightly easier start is to move left 10 feet and lieback the big flake before you mantel onto the block above the finger crack.\n\nP2) Move from the belay station to the big ledge below pitch two. Mantel onto a small shelf right off the ledge, then clip a glue-in. Move right into the shallow corner, then back left onto the slab. Follow the slab for three more glue-ins to a three bolt belay station.\n\nThis is a really easy route by San Rafael standards, but it is super fun and well protected. It should find appeal for those not adept to the pain and suffering of small splitters and the self flagellation of chimneys and off widths.","protection":"Finger sized cam for the crux finger crack.
