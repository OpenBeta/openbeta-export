A #6 protects this well. From the ledge, tech your way up the offset seam past a few bolts, climb the patina finger crack, join the other crack at the end of the finger crack, then continue up this crack to the 2-bolt belay. The second half of this pitch takes good gear. An optional 0.1, gray C3, or small nut can be placed in-between two of the bolts. 5.11ish, 100 feet\n\nP2) More great patina face climbing with intermittent cracks but much lower angle. Climb the right angling crack from the belay until you can see the first bolt. Look around for some gear right before the bolt. Climb the slab by the first bolt then climb past 2 more bolts supplemented with gear to the obvious crack exit through the roof system.
