The crux of the pitch comes right at the start where the crack is thin hands (.75 camalot) size for a few feet before you gain a big jug and the crack widens to perfect hands for the rest of the pitch. The pitch ends at the obvious 3 bolt anchor after maybe 75 feet.\n\nPitch 2: Continue up the crack which turns into an offwidth dihedral right after the anchors. This is the technical crux of the route at 5.10. At the top of the dihedral you'll see two bolts off to the right. This is the top of another route. When you see the first bolt, traverse left and continue up another 25 feet of easy climbing to the large belay ledge with a bolted anchor.\n\nPitch 3: Sandy slab with a bolt to a sandy dihedral to a few sandy slab moves to the bolted anchors.\n\nPitch 4: sandy 5.8 crack to a bolted headwall with a scary looking pile of rocks for a back step. Tread lightly in spots.\n\nEnjoy the views from the top of the mesa. They are spectacular.","protection":"You should be good with a double set of cams up to 3\" plus a couple of larger pieces for the offwidth on pitch 2.\n\nFrom what I understand you can rap off the route in four single rope raps, I'm not sure if you can do it with a 60, but think so.  For the third rap, use the anchors that you saw off to your right while climbing the second pitch.","location":"This route is the leftmost route on the scenic byway wall and is the wall's namesake."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ZySN2IbPWfebrSD08dB85Q==","name":"Metacarpal Road Map","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"James and Franziska Garrett, 1992","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.71998,39.15435]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108753546","mp_crag_id":"108187655","climb_id":"ZySN2IbPWfebrSD08dB85Q==","areaRef":"xqQiQcMNVtW6BmuEuXr26g=="},"content":{"description":"This route shares a start with Scenic Byway but takes the rightward trending crack in a dihedral.
