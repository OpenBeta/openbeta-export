The once feared Whoa Dude Traverse is now quite tame. The rock has cleaned up and some friendly bolts have been added. This pitch originally went down on gear, really bad gear... I vividly recall Mark traversing into the unknown , blindly shoving cams into the dirty crack at his ankles. Holds were breaking, and the feet were sandy and insecure. One of the more impressive things I’ve witnessed. ..then I realized I had to follow it.. and not fall.. Whoa Dude!\n\nP 1:  5.10+ The Whoa Dude Traverse! Start in the chimney to OW on the right. Not too bad. Face holds make it more fun and easy than it looks.\n\nTraverse left on crimps, face holds and cracks.\n\nP2:  5.10+ Varied crack with face holds. Super fun pitch! Bring the whole rack and long runners.\n\nP3:  5.10+ Move the belay over to the obvious small tips to hands crack. Climb up the crack* to the base of the #4s roof crack. Climb the crack or face climb right and mantel . From this ledge climb the awesome 3 bolt arête.\n\n*be careful of the block at the top of the first crack\n\nDescent: rap route with 1 70m\n\nA 10 min walk south down the wall will bring you to Yeah Dude!\n\nAfternoon shade","protection":"Gear: (2x) .4 - #1      (3x) #2 - 3      (1-2x) #4     Runners & draws    (1x ) 70m","location":"The wooden outhouse 5.1 miles north of the San Rafael River bridge\n\nPlease be careful on the approach. There is a lot of crypto in the field. The path of least resistance goes from the outhouse into the wash then straight to the base of the  steep  ramp in the center of the first cliff band. Once you hit the ramp, hike up to  a small pine with a short mantel move. Then hike up and right to the obvious base of Whoa Dude.  Hike straight up from pine for Yeah Dude."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,74906d35-9873-5e60-a707-98956a7c83be,7eaba727-ba1e-5e96-8b35-8d02cac22754,9d045cdb-08f2-5094-9ee3-7dde0e1c2883","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Buckhorn Wash","Upper Buckhorn","Dude Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.70253,39.13405]},"bbox":[-110.70310970442351,39.13360033981813,-110.70195029557647,39.13449966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116702635","area_id":"nQRc2wjyUJSe433eDhwogw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.70310970442351,39.13360033981813],[-110.70195029557647,39.13360033981813],[-110.70195029557647,39.13449966018186],[-110.70310970442351,39.13449966018186],[-110.70310970442351,39.13360033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:32.518Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:41.884Z"}
