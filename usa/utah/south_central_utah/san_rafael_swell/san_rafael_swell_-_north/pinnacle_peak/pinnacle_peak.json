It appears someone has climbed a pitch on the northeast side of the tower to the chimney but failed to reach the summit. But maybe not?\n\nPitch 1, A3-\n\n. Begin up a thin beak seam leading to a bolt 20 feet off the ground. Continue up the series of seams with 2 more widely spaced bolts (A3-). The last half turns into a mix of clean/hammer aid (A2). Reach a two bolt anchor under a small roof.\n\n85 feet.\n\nPitch 2, 5.6 C2 R\n\n. Aid out of the left side of the roof on some horrific rock. Cut left, on even scarier rock, and continue left up the obvious crack system (C2). Mixed free and aid with loose rock leads to the summit ridge. From the summit ridge, make an awkward, chossy mantle to the top which must be down-climbed.\n\n80 feet.\n\nA double 60M rope rappel north from the summit ridge gets you back to the ground.","protection":"A conservative rack will consist of:\n\nA selection of medium/large peckers/beaks, spectres, angles (small/medium/large), and a double rack of cams from BD C4 #0.3 to #6. I also found z-pins and z-pin stacks to be helpful but not mandatory.\n\nDid not use knife blades/bugaboos or lost arrows. The double #6s are helpful on the second pitch.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,d3184b0e-0780-59f2-8621-6c14ab608f10,67f26b54-4119-5f5d-b020-a345ece68e1f","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - North","Pinnacle Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.88832,39.5943]},"bbox":[-110.88890353725162,39.59385033981814,-110.88773646274838,39.594749660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115429063","area_id":"Z/JrVEEZX12wIKNF7OaOHw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:31.057Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:28.365Z"}
