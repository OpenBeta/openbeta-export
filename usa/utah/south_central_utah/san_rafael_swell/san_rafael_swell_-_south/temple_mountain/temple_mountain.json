Once at the saddle, hike/scramble north to the base of the ridge leading up to the northern summit massive. Pick your way through a few short bands leading up and through the final cliff band. Depending on the line chosen, it will range from 5.4 to 5.6. Once you've reached the top of the final cliff band, hike east to the final class 3-4 scramble up the summit pyramid where you can enjoy the fantastic views.\n\nFor the descent, rappel off a block down the upper cliff band. Another optional short rappel avoids a semi-tricky short 12 foot downclimb. With a well chosen rappel anchor (the rock slung in 2018 worked), a 30M rope barely suffices.","protection":"Select single rack if desired. 30M-50M rope for descent.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,3bbf61ef-6f4a-5261-a323-d6721c953a97,9ce66cc9-4b74-5f68-ba72-a45e1e1dd5f8","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - South","Temple Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.67917,38.68829]},"bbox":[-110.67974607516665,38.68784033981814,-110.67859392483332,38.68873966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114303467","area_id":"nOZsyUt0X2i6cqReHh3V+A=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:32.493Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:29.293Z"}
