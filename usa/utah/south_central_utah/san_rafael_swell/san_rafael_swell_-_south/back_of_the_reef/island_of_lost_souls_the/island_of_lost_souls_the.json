Mostly hands to fingers with a few really fun crack boulder problems to mantles.  The bottom 10 feet is sandy as is the last 5 feet but everything in the middle is pretty good. Looks like a slabby 5.8 from the ground but its not.\n\nWe moved our packs to the side but not enough to feel good about cleaning the rocks off the ledge by the anchors.  So if you get on this be sure to leave the bottom of the route clear and knock the debris off.","protection":"We sewed this one up as its on the yellow Wingate (I think its wingate). 1-2 red camalots, 4 2.5 friends, 2-3 yellow metolius fat cams, 2-3 orange metolius fat cams, medium HB offsets, 4 long runners.  2 painted bolts with slings and a rap ring.
