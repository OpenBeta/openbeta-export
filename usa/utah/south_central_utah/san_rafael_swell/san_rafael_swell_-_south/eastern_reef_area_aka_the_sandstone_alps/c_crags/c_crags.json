It's a good easily accessed starter route on the complex east slabs. The East Ridge itself was previously climbed and has a single bolt rap anchor up high.\n\nPitch 1: Climb a thin left-angling corner/crack (5.7R) and then up right onto an easier black slab.

Climb the left side of the flake 20 feet to a good ledge with a 1-bolt and gear belay. 200 feet.\n\nPitch 2: Smear up a nice slab (5.4 R) to a steeper section and a bolt. Friction moves (5.7) lead up to a ledge and 1 drilled piton belay below a hump. 175 feet.\n\nRappel from here with double 200-foot ropes or climb down south to the top of a pour-off and below a slot canyon. Scramble 800 feet up the rounded East Ridge, following whatever course suits you and making it either easy or easier. About two-thirds up the ridge, climb a 200-foot pitch (5.0 R) left of a steeper rotten face. At the top of this pitch is a single rappel bolt placed by a previous party. Scramble to the summit from here.\n\nDescent: Downclimb the upper slabs to the rappel bolt. Rappel 200 feet and then scramble back down to the top of Sexy Ogre. Make 2 double-rope rappels (175 feet and 200 feet) from single anchors back to the cliff base.","protection":"Rack: Small selection of Stoppers, TCUs, and small cams; 2 200-foot ropes","location":"Finding the cliff: Drive south from I-70 for almost 2 miles and park on the right (west) in an obvious campsite/parking area just before a wash. Hike west on a trail along the wash for a quarter mile until it makes a sharp left. Continue straight and scramble up a slabby pour-off.  Hike west up the brushy wash to the base of a large slabby buttress.
