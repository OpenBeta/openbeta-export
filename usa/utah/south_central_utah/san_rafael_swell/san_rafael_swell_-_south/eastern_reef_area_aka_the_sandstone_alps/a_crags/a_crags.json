Walk up the wash a few hundred yards to some old cottonwood trees.  From there, leave the wash and follow an old road/trail towards Little Spotted Wolf Canyon.  Walk up a steep hill and down into the wash on the other side.  From here you can easily see the mouth of Little Spotted Wolf canyon to the west.  Instead of going into the canyon, follow the wash to the north for about 600 feet.  About 30 feet before a small, white boulder in the middle of the wash are some large bushes on the left and a cairn.  From there, follow a cairned trail to the NW and up the major talus tooth just south of Forgotten Buttress.  At the top of the tooth there is a juniper tree and a sloping ledge heading north.
