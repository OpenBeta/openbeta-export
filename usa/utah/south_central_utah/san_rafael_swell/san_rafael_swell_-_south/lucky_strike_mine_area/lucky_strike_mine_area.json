Follow old ATV tracks in the wash and hike up talus skirting a few small cliff bands to the base of the tower.  DPOS is the tower to the left with the wide crack splitting it.  Easy fifth class climbing leads to a gully behind the main wall and tower.  Scramble up this gully to just below a large chockstone shaped like a guillotine.  There is a nice thin crack in a smooth wall leading up the tower from here.  The route is not visible from anywhere on the ground.  Waxing and Waning begins in the thin crack below the chockstone."},"__v":0},{"_id":"mpR8f38zXTKADyjIiEPw0w==","name":"D.P.O.S.","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Ben Folsom and Maura Hahnenberger   Oct.  6, 2007","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.94877,38.75573]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106039778","mp_crag_id":"106039775","climb_id":"mpR8f38zXTKADyjIiEPw0w==","areaRef":"B6ZXPK5eX16yx1BuwYyHag=="},"content":{"description":"This route is a sandy, dirty and difficult offwidth crack climbing rotten rock.  Scramble up to the base of the crack with a few committing and very runout moves before getting to the crack.  Loose and sandy jamming gets wider and wider.  Pass a bolt at about 50 feet from the start of the crack.  Continue up as the crack gets wider.  The crack becomes too wide for even #5 camalots.  I ended up placing a 5 bolt ladder to the right of the offwidth due to a snowstorm, no protection and super sandy rock.  This offwidth will go free, but it will be very hard.  (but at least there is good protection now.)  After the bolts there is about 10 more feet of 5.10 offwidth to get to a saddle just below the summit of the tower and a two bolt anchor.  I did not continue to the summit due to the softness of the rock.  It was some of the worst rock I have ever climbed on.","protection":"3 sets of cams from #0.5 camalot to #5 camalot.","location":"In the Lucky Strike Mine area there is a side canyon just south of the main Lucky Strike Mine canyon.
