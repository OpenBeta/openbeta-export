I cleaned all the small stuff. The large blocks feel solid but use caution. The climbing past the blocks is about 10a/b. After the blocks, follow the big hands crack through several OW pods.

From the hanging belay, pull a small roof on hand jams and ring locks. The crack peters out, so you need to transfer to a crack about 7 feet to the right. I accomplished this by a short pendulum off a few .4s. I intended to put in a bolt but got rained off. The traverse might go free. After the pendulum, there is a short but tough section of steep splitter .75 ring locks. This felt like 11+ but could be aided with a few slings. After a good stance, the crack turns to perfect hands through a steep flare with some good rests.
