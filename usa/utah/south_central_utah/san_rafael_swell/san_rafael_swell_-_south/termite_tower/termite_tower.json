From the south side of the tower, climb the middle of the 3 obvious cracks up the face â€“ the lesser of three evils. Pitch one begins with an OW crux to a neat chimney to a ledge. Crank up overhanging hands with a chossy start to another ledge and belay here. Pitch 2 continues up a hand crack with some less-than-stellar rock to a pod. Escape the pod where easier but very sandy climbing leads to a shoulder at the top. An anchor gear can be challenging to find. Rappel from a bolted anchor back south. A single 70M rope BARELY reaches the starting ledge with a VERY extended anchor. Tie knots! Or take two ropes.","protection":"Double set, single BD C4 #5 & 6","location":"South Face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,e4d8e72f-30cd-5b47-a812-224c8b92e8c9,3bbf61ef-6f4a-5261-a323-d6721c953a97,5701f0c4-a0f7-58a5-80da-1fce818e88a8","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","San Rafael Swell","San Rafael Swell - South","Termite Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.01448,38.6971]},"bbox":[-111.01505614611793,38.696650339818135,-111.01390385388207,38.697549660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120419380","area_id":"VwHwxKD3WKWA2h/OgY6IqA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:32.492Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:14.326Z"}
