Awesome climbing up through good aid placements and some free climbing will take you to the shoulder of the tower where you will find a 2 bolt anchor at the top of pitch one. After this anchor you again pull a few free moves to continue through some more aiding past 2 bolts and then you wrap around to your  right(So you are above where you started climbing the tower) and you'll find a 3 bolt anchor at the top of pitch 2. This anchor serves as the rappel anchor and the anchor to belay for the last couple of moves to get to the summit. Climb past one bolt and one tack to get on top. There is no anchor on top due to the very poor rock. Take turns with your partner getting on top and then climb back down and rappel from there. Awesome rappel!","protection":"Standard desert rack to 6\". Pins, cams, and a few quickdraws.
