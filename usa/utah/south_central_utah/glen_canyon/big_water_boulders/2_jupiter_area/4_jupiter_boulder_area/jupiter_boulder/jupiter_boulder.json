While I doubt it is going to fall, and you don't need to pull on it at all, it is a severe danger factor in an already dangerous boulder problem. The landing is bad, and if you fall it is necessary for your spotter to keep you on the boulder where your pad is.","location":"South face of the MGB."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,f2ade6be-2758-576e-afe6-6b1b9e8ccf22,2c6257ae-5c53-58be-bded-a05c63b07a66,0701c2bb-9493-579e-8f15-2604ad0e6545,3d209232-68ae-5ebd-b2e5-6da6bbcfb9a5,05db9a93-e63a-576c-bf9d-dc8e94da7bc0","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","Glen Canyon","Big Water Boulders","2.
