However good gear wasn't far below.\n\nThis is included here to differentiate this nice looking tower from the MFT just down the road.  I'll need to dig through my photos of the last trip through here, but will post some asap.  I also asked the third ascent team for theirs too.","protection":"Standard desert rack","location":"Follow the NP633 road north from near Hite Marina for about 25 miles.  It's the only road heading north between the two bridges, and the same road one uses to access the Maze.  You'll first reach The\n\nMiddle Finger Tower\n\nabout 5 miles before the Sewing Machine Needle, which is located at ​\n\n37.969002, -110.274533\n\n​​​"},"__v":0},{"_id":"+whvxFYFV5OX4Am1R/FrHQ==","name":"The Middle Finger Tower","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Bill Duncan, Steve Anderton","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.9913,38.17662]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"105852796","mp_crag_id":"105849557","climb_id":"+whvxFYFV5OX4Am1R/FrHQ==","areaRef":"ASUwKcN4WzikAdEmN6vIJg=="},"content":{"description":"The route starts on the south side of the spire.\n\nThe original description:\n\nClimb a short 5.8-9 dihedral to get to the good ledge (the knuckle). The route follows the obvious weakness above, which is a crack that start on top of a large square block and zig-zags up.  Use some bird beaks, and thin to medium pins or clean aid to get to the shoulder.

Climb crack in a dihedral, 5.8, to a small ledge, then a couple aid moves to a ledge/shoulder. Belay in rubble field, from pins and a single bolt (30', 5.8, A1).\n\n2. Mantel onto block, then gain a left-angling crack that starts 15 feet above the bolt (tricky). There were no existing pin scars in this crack. Work up and left to 10-foot dihedral. Up this to rubbly shoulder. Build complex belay (might be safer, but less comfy, to belay from bomber cams in the dihedral below) (50', A3-).\n\n3. Up to small roof, then short steep thin crack to mantel onto loose ledge. Angle left and up, past two drilled holes (pins in horizontals bypass the scary-looking holes), to free moves onto the summit (30', A2. 5.7).\n\nGreat summit. Lying on one's belly and peering over the northwest edge of the summit is highly recommended.","protection":"Small desert rack with a few bird beaks and a couple of knifeblades or short-thins will do the trick.","location":"This tower is located about 10 miles down the road to the Maze District of the Canyonlands NP.
