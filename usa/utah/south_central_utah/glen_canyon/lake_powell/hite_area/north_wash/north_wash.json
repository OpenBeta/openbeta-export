The approach is long, the drive sucks and the climbing is scrappy; however, the scenery and adventure level are top notch.\n\nThere might be a better way to do the approach but we started from the 4WD road north of Hatch Canyon. Begin by scrambling down into Hatch Canyon, meander south to intersect Fiddler Cove Canyon, and then hike back east back up Fiddler Cove Canyon to the base of the tower (5-6 miles one way). The twin towers on a mesa in the middle of the canyon are extremely obvious. Fiddle Sticks Tower is the easier looking, northern tower on the mesa.\n\nTo reach the base of the climb, scramble up a gully on the north side of the mesa to gain the pedestal that hosts the two towers (class 4). The climb begins up the obvious crack on the east face of the northern tower.\n\nStart the climb by traversing on a narrow ledge to a crack of horrid choss and loose blocks. Climb up the crack 20 feet, very carefully (5.9-10 PG-13, some could argue R due to rock quality), to an overhanging finger crack. Aid or free the crack (we aided C1 estimated free climbing at 12-) to a short OW section. Continue past the OW to a nice hand crack that peters out. Once the crack ends, do a sandy traverse right to another crack system which takes you to the top of the tower.\n\nTo our astonishment, we found an anchor on the summit! Rappel back east to the pedestal. A single 60M will suffice.","protection":"Double finger and hand sized pieces. A #5 BD C4 was very helpful for the OW.","location":"Located in GCNMR North of Hite.
