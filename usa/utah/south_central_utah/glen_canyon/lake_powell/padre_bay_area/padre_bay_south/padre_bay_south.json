A boat start is recommended with two hands over the first mini-roof. There is a great left foot that you can trust until the boats clears. The start is immediately cruxy. Enjoy the first drop knee to move around the roof. The steep angled crack climbing is desperate with little to no feet until you reach the second mini-roof crack and the trusty second drop knee. Try-hard face and an undercling to get over it. Move right to the obvious square glory jug aka the 30-rack. Drop off there.\n\nLake Powell was 465 ft deep at the dam when climbed. If lower the start would be an undercling under the mini-roof.","protection":"DWS","location":"Drive from Padre Bay through the channel as if you're heading to Last Chance Bay. Pass Face Canyon staying on the southern edge of the channel. Follow the huge cliff. Drive until you get close to where it slopes down and look for the 30-rack box (see pics)!"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,f2ade6be-2758-576e-afe6-6b1b9e8ccf22,0609e270-053b-56ea-a94b-1a7576d14f0f,99861e20-25d9-599e-b4d3-ba6d3ef8a3f6,34b26851-612d-5645-a24e-420a0d8cbab8","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","Glen Canyon","Lake Powell","Padre Bay Area","Padre Bay South"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a/b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.24315,37.0203]},"bbox":[-111.24371318594564,37.01985033981814,-111.24258681405438,37.02074966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119570982","area_id":"NLJoUWEtVkWiTkIKDYy6uA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:37.200Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:34.926Z"}
