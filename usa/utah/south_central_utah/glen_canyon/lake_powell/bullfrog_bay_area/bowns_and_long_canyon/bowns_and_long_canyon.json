Start in the water on good hands which turns into tight hands then ring locks (crux). Use a few good faceholds when in the ringlock section. Then finish out the climb by stepping to the right side of the crack to gain a ledge below a tips/fingers dihedral. This is a good stance to huck a gainer into the water below.\n\nOn the FA a nose ring was ripped out at the crux be prepared.\n\nTheres an OW to the right, left and another hand crack to the left that we climbed.","protection":"DWS.","location":"This climb is just before the turn into Bowns or Long Canyon. It is on the north side between miles 74 and 75. It is in a small inlet into the north side of the canyon.
