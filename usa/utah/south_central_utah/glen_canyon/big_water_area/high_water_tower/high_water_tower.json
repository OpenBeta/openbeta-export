Three pitches of clean aid. Each pitch progressively losses quality until you reach the cap rock. The setting is exceptionally beautiful and filled with small sculptured hoodoos. The summit views are spectacular. You can look into two states as well as see Lake Powell, the Grand Staircase, and the Navajo Reservation.  An adventure for the specialized climber who knows choss.","protection":"A “full” desert rack which includes many slings, nuts, “etc.”. For your descent, a 70-meter rope will get you from the summit to the top of the first pitch. Then the same rope gets you back onto the starting shelf.","location":"Just north of Big Water Utah and opposite the BLM Visitor Center, turn west on Ethan Allen Rd. for just .3 miles. At the Concord Bridge intersection turn right at the brown government sign on NP Rd. 230. Take this for 3.3 miles to the “Road Side Boulders” and park in their shade. Cross the road and hike east toward a notch in the ridge line. Follow a rough trail down to a wash then up on a bench. The trail becomes more distinct here. Work your way down the soft slick rock to reach the gray sandy basin. Around a few washes to the shadier side of the tower where a high shelf has a chimney to start the romp. Car to route about 20 minutes.  (See approach trail best on the \"Big Water Boulder's Site\""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,f2ade6be-2758-576e-afe6-6b1b9e8ccf22,ce95d72e-69b1-530f-a782-a228375d13aa,8f50d882-2de7-5b81-82bc-a6cacf352703","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","Glen Canyon","Big Water Area","High Water Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.6083,37.05912]},"bbox":[-111.6088634739747,37.05867033981814,-111.6077365260253,37.05956966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119426103","area_id":"j1DYgi3nW4GCvKbKzzUnAw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:34.851Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:33.847Z"}
