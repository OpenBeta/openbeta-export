You will also need 3 quick draws and two shoulder length runners.\n\nThere are four hand drilled bolts (put up ground up) on the line that followed the best rock.  Some may need extending.  The anchor on top (three bolts) is the best we could do.  A baby angle and more tat would improve the situation.","location":"A mostly flat and beautiful 45 minute hike. Start in the Buckskin Wash parking lot/trail head, where a restroom is provided. Leave a note on your wind shield that you are not going in to the pay areas OR pay and avoid any issues. Hike down Buckskin Wash for about 15 min.s until you see a prominent side canon on you left. Cut up and north here. On two occasions you will have to forage around a steep spillage but always follow this drainage. Eventually you will reach the band of white cliffs and Paria Pillar. See the map. I \"think\" I am correct here.\n\nThe line is in the space formed between the pillar and the main wall or on Paria Pillar\"s north wall.  The south wall or exposed side, has a crack that will also go free (see photos below).\n\nWhen the side canyon levels out and runs up into the white cliffs, cut left and north west to the obvious detached pillar."},"__v":0},{"_id":"hH889mZMWvSoXN+7/9OdBg==","name":"The Giant Vagina","yds":"5.8+","grades":{"yds":"5.8+","french":"5b"},"fa":"Jerry Foreman, Dan Millis","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.98298,37.07114]},"left_right_index":11,"mp_id":"107467055","mp_crag_id":"118026703","climb_id":"hH889mZMWvSoXN+7/9OdBg==","areaRef":"ZcW4s3jsW5uQe8tR0QzOFQ=="},"content":{"description":"We were looking for the ultimate offwidth/chimney, but climbed this instead.
