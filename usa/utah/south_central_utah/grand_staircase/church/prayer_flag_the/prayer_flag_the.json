The rock looks good and the approach is really not that bad. Well, the rock IS that bad! Bummer!  So that's the crux. Moves on moderately okay gear gets you to the first bolt. Every tap of the hammer sent chills down my spine with the hollow thunk sound that reverberated around in my brain and made me pucker.  Sooo...  way more bolts than I had planned.  They surprisingly held my weight while aiding up and right in search of the best of bad rock.  I found that with little effort or pain I could improve finger edges to two pads with minimal back and forth of my hand.  Disconcerting to say the least, but I used them, and to my relief, they worked (is that chipping?). The moves themselves would go free at around 9+, BUT you had better be light weight and strong, as well as bold if you free this.  Consolation is the the bolts are close together (no guarantees if you fall).","protection":"Passive:  Set of Tricams\n\nActive:  BD #1 X 1,.75 X 1,.5 X 1,.4 X 1,.3 X 1\n\nBolts:  4 in questionable choss.\n\nRope:  A 50 or 60 will work.\n\nAnchor:  Ugh!  The rock at the top was the worst!  I brought long webbing to wrap the summit but it was not long enough. Ugh!  So, two 1/2\" bolts in the best I could find.  Bring an old 30 foot piece of rope to run through these hangers and around the summit.  The webbing should be pulled.","location":"On the north side of \"The Prayer Flag\""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,4287d9d7-df8a-5818-aad3-2dd5180eb500,67c0f9c7-c50d-5dba-a805-6b05981cd235,89d6ad3e-43cf-5c33-accd-94730da5e047","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","Grand Staircase","Church","Prayer Flag, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.772,37.14932]},"bbox":[-111.77256414536289,37.14887033981814,-111.77143585463716,37.14976966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113870245","area_id":"idatPkPPXDOszZRzDaXgRw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:38.463Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:36.225Z"}
