From the col, you can start an adventure with mostly good rock.  Not until about 30 feet up the second pitch does the line sour with poor quality rock and potential for the belayer to be \"Trumped\" by the unintentional carpet bombing of potentially lethal sized blocks. R for the leader here but X for the belayer.  After the danger zone, the climb again becomes a joy to be on. The exit is a blast and the summit portal through the cap stone is an anomaly worth seeing though not venturing into.","protection":"Passive:  Many small to large nuts and a \"full\" set of tricams\n\nActive:  Full set of small cams,  Aliens, BD .3-.4 X 2, .5-.75 X 4, 1s X 3, 2s X 3, 3s X 3, 4s X 4, and one # 5.\n\nAnchor:  Two bolts with a cordellett and a locker.\n\nRopes:  Two 60m","location":"Starting on the north side or the formation, take the easy 4th class line up to the obvious col.
