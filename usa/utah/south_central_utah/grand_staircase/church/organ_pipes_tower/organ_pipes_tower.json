It proved to be as we had hoped, and provided a fine outing with a mix of straightforward aid on soft rock and fun free climbing on the better upper band. The star rating was given relative to the greater Grand Staircase area; although fun, this certainly ain't no Castle Valley classic. However, for those accustomed to soft rock and who don't mind a little time in etriers, it is well worthwhile.\n\nP1--Start by stick-clipping or with a shoulder stand (how it got drilled, with difficulty) to a drilled angle that unfortunately wouldn't hammer in to the eye, but is quite solidly seated in its hole. Reach left to the splitter crack system, which starts thin; a couple decent med/large stoppers can get you through the thinnest section without having to rely on tiny cams in the soft rock. Continue up undulating fingers/fat fingers until the crack pinches down to a seam. Transition right past another drilled angle, some gear placements in large hollow flakes (seem well attached) and a bolt into the better, brown rock layer and the hanging dihedral system that dominates the southwest face of the Pipes. A short section of stembox, with a fist crack on the left and a thin crack on the right leads past some blocks to a small stance and 2 bolt anchor. Most of the pitch takes finger-thin hand sized gear except the final stretch, in which everything from a #4 to .00 mastercam were used. 75', C2\n\nP2-- Lower angled off-width with face features ends with a steeper OW bit to the top of a pillar. Proceed through a bugling section of thin hands that is relatively moderate thanks to chunky face features. Finish through the bizzare, cobble-studded conglomerate cap rock to the awesome summit. Ditch the wide cams down low, and otherwise only bring a couple #.75 and #1s and maybe a #.5 for this pitch.   50', 5.9","protection":"2 drilled angles, 1 bolt\n\na few med/large stoppers\n\n(1X) gray through blue Mastercams or equivalent (four lobed pieces nice on the soft rock!)\n\n(1X).3\n\n(3X).4\n\n(4X).5\n\n(2X).75-#3\n\n(1X)#4\n\n(2X)#5,#6\n\nAll above units listed in BD C4 sizes.\n\nWith a single 70m rope you can rap from the summit anchors and hit the ground just barely with rope stretch.
