This is a beautiful area and the colors here are postcard-esque!  The first aid moves are disconcerting.  Then you run through some good climbing until you reach a vertical off-width/chimney.  There is gear and hands in the back of this intimidating 30 foot head tester. The exit is awkward but doable.","protection":"Passive = Black and pink tricams, small wires and offsets\n\nActive = 00 Met. through .3 BD X 1, BD #1s through #5s X3.\n\nAnchor = 3 bolts with webbing and a quick link\n\nRope = A single 60 meter will \"just\" get you to the ground.","location":"East of \"Promise Rock\" and just a hundred feet off the cliff band this tower is easy to find though not easily seen from the road.  The Wolf-Dog line is on the northeast side of Dog Gone Tower.  Scramble up some loose blocks onto a low col between the tower and a much shorter pile.  Then traverse right on a small ledge to a thin crack.  Place a lot of small gear and step into aiders.  A few moves gets you to a large ledge.  The rest of the line goes free."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,7e6f2683-14a8-5d92-ad8b-63d6bae8ef72,4287d9d7-df8a-5818-aad3-2dd5180eb500,7fac41c0-14a1-5c81-be93-b567b63ba107,6bcb8e13-98b7-5b29-abc9-b3327d953921","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","South Central Utah","Grand Staircase","Cannonville Area","Dog Gone Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.02593,37.53804]},"bbox":[-112.0264970732732,37.53759033981814,-112.02536292672677,37.53848966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110045961","area_id":"a8uOE5i3WymrybMyfZU5IQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-112.0264970732732,37.53759033981814],[-112.02536292672677,37.53759033981814],[-112.02536292672677,37.53848966018187],[-112.0264970732732,37.53848966018187],[-112.0264970732732,37.53759033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:37.781Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:09.083Z"}
