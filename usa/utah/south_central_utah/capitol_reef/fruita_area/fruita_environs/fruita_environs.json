Want to see a picture?  Go to the national park's web page and look for \"climbing regulations.\"  Basically, the climb goes like this:  fingers with precarious rests, to thin hands, to a perfect gold camalot eight foot roof in a small corner, to kind of crumbly big hands.The tough start can be easier done by face climbing some edges from the right, and there is a perfect foot hold right when you need to push up over the roof.The section above the roof kind of takes away from the overall quality of the climb, as it is a bit crumbly.  You may want to check the webbing at the anchors.","protection":"can't quite remember, but you'll want everything from yellow metollius to 3.5 camalot","location":"To reach\n\nCapitol Roof\n\n, drive towards the developed campground in Fruita, and pull off at the hiking trail for Cohab Canyon.\n\nCoordinates for TH: 38.283916, -111.237854\n\nFollow the steep, developed trail up switchbacks. when you get to the Wingate, walk south past the head of a canyon, and THEN look for the roof.
