Free climb choss to a thin finger crack through a roof.  Aid (or free) up crack to lower angle crack and scramble to top.  OK rock quality. A novelty more than anything else because it doesn't even qualify as a tower.  The opposite side of this crack (The North Face Crack) looks like it is  good choice and will easily go free, but it was cold and we were more into the sun than the shade.","protection":"Several #2-4 TCU's; 2 #.75 Camalots; #s 2&3 Camalots for the anchor (or use bigger gear #6 Friend and #4 Camalot).  Descend via one simultaneous rappel off the south and north sides.  One rope will suffice if it is 60 meters.  No bolts.","location":"From the visitor's center travel west on Hwy 24 to the pullout for twin rocks.  This pullout is on the south side of the highway and is about 1/2 mile before the park boundary.  Park at pullout and run across the road, making sure to look both ways, and hike up faint path to base of obvious splitter crack on the south face."},"__v":0},{"_id":"+NoiL89ZVzOyro9twX2pAQ==","name":"Quiditch","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Anthony Marra and Austin Wilkins","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.34057,38.32619]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"112303674","mp_crag_id":"112303667","climb_id":"+NoiL89ZVzOyro9twX2pAQ==","areaRef":"pYUoRJ1/VtqLJaSnauPjjQ=="},"content":{"description":"A nice hand crack that progressively gets steeper and then wider to a fun offwidth the top.
