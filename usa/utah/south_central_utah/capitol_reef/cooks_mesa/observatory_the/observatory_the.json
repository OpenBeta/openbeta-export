This route has three sections with good rests between.  Thrilling variety of crack technique, plus several key face and block features.  Two good hand jams will get your feet off the ground, then right to fists and an offwidth mini-roof.  This soon slopes back to a ledge rest before a steep corner section which again starts at good hands, but diminishes to 11/2\" throug the crux transition onto big positive holds above.  Another rest will refresh excitement for the final steepening ramp/corner towards a big pull onto the ridge-top block.  Clambering up over this leads to anchors at a large platform.
