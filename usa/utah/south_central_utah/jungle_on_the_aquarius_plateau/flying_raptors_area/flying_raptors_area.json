Clip the first bolt long.  The second clip is up and left toward a notch in the arete.  Mantle atop the blocky cut out in the arete and place a BD .4 here clipped long.  The next moves are a sketchy traverse toward an awkward side pull.  Move up a bit to a better stance and clip another bolt long prior to reaching far right and pulling your gear and straightening your line.  More side pulls will get you to the fourth bolt where a 4’ runner would help.  Up and right back to the arete through thin edging and arete climbing.  Cross over to the high face above and work right and up to the anchor or clip here and top out in only a few moves.  There seems to be two cruxes.
