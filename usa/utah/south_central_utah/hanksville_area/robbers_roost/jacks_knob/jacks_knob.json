Continue past the pin (crux) and traverse left to another pin (some minor questionable rock before the second pin). Then climb or aid a splitter finger crack to a pod and from the pod, aid or free climb (my guess is 10+/11-) through a short roof to a large ledge. Fix the line off gear and a single pin.\n\n5.8 C1, 80 feet\n\nPitch 2 –\n\nFrom the top of the pitch one, scramble up a loose gully (class 3) to a short chimney. Move the belay to here. Climb the chimney and climb some loose rock to the summit.\n\n5.5, 50 feet\n\nFrom the summit, complete a short rappel or down-climb (exposed and loose) 10 feet to an anchor on the top of the south side of the tower. A double 60M rope rappel reaches the ground from here. A single 70M rope could be used since there is an intermediate anchor on the south face.","protection":"BD C4 2X #0.2-3. 3X #0.5-1, 1X #4.
