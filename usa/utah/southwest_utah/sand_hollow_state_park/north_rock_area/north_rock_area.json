The crux is the first 10ft, it requires a toe match that can be scary when you have wet feet. The good thing is the crux is the most protected part of the climb. The second half of the climb is easy with lots of good pinches and jugs to right in the middle of the route. Although the second half is much easier you do need to be careful because a fall here could have you hitting the rock before hitting the water.","protection":"Deep water solo. Good water protection for the first 20ft but the end hangs inward and a fall here could cause problems. If you aren't comfortable climbing solo I would advise wearing a helmet.","location":"Start directly under the \"Canfield\" engraving on the rock. This is the most obvious and easiest-looking start on the wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,69e9c28e-b0db-5bf2-82e5-7c266c90e844,ee633c9b-559d-57ad-8589-8b4956de81ab","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Sand Hollow State Park","North Rock Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[],"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.37836,37.12472]},"bbox":[-113.37892396195974,37.12427033981814,-113.37779603804027,37.12516966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120943347","area_id":"7mM8m1WdV62FiYtJVt6Bqw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-113.37892396195974,37.12427033981814],[-113.37779603804027,37.12427033981814],[-113.37779603804027,37.12516966018187],[-113.37892396195974,37.12516966018187],[-113.37892396195974,37.12427033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:38.467Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:09.823Z"}
