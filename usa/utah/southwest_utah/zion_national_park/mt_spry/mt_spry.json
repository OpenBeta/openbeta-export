As a free climb it presents a wild arrangement of novel movement on soft rock. The steep climbing necessitates multiple heel hooks and knee bars, unique fare for a Zion wall. Future parties should expect exciting climbing above reasonable protection in Zionâ€™s softer stone. All pitches have fixed anchors on comfy ledges to rappel the route.\n\n*Feel free to replace the knifeblades on P3 with bolts, add a bolted anchor above the crux P9 roof, or add a bolt to protect the P7 crack switch*\n\nP1: 5.10+, 35m\n\nHead up the varnished thin hands crack corner, continuing straight up through a chimney and a short fist crack to 2 bolts on a nice ledge\n\nP2: 5.11-, 40m\n\nClimb the double cracks straight above the belay. Physical and dead vertical. Mostly hands to fists with a squeeze chimney finish. 2 bolts on a great ledge\n\nP3: 5.12a 30m\n\nClimb the varnished layback off the belay until it ends. Traverse high and right here past two bolts on a slab. Two more bolts and some fixed knifeblades take you up a cruxy stem corner to 2 bolts at a sloping stance\n\nP4: 5.11+ R 20m\n\nClimb the flared crack out the right side of the roof. Once above the roof, traverse on face holds to the crack out left. Continue through nice hands and fingers to a 2 bolts belay and a small foot stance.\n\nP5: 5.11 30m\n\nHead straight up through a hand crack in a flare chimney, a leaning offwidth pod, and a short face traverse right to a 2 bolt anchor on a small ledge.\n\nP6: 5.9 20m\n\nStep right to a great finger crack in a tight flare. Above the flare, stem gently through loose rock to a sloping ledge with a 2 bolt anchor.\n\nP7: 5.10 R 30m\n\nHead up the chossy corner through stepped terrain. Place gear high in the buldge, traverse right to a shallow poorly protected chimney, and thendo a spooky traverse back left once above the buldge. (The original aid pitch went up the seam corner through the first bulge at C1) Continue to two bolts on a comfy yet loose ledge.\n\nP8: 5.10+ 25m\n\nShort pitch of thin hands through a flake tunnel to a large sloping ledge atop the flake with two bolts\n\nP9: 5.12 40m\n\nContinue up the corner left off the belay through wildy steep laybacking out a roof. Above the roof, diagonal left through a slab chimney to it's end, then straight up through a wild lip encounter! Rap from tat on a small tree\n\nDecent\n\n:\n\nRap the route with two ropes.\n\nFix the tag line to the anchor for the overhanging last pitch.\n\nLink P3 and P4 on the way down with some swinging and directionals on the traverse bolts.
