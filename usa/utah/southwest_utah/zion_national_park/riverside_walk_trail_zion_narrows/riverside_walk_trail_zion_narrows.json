Walk up the river trail about 10 minutes. Look left across the river(west side) for a large, broken left facing corner system. There is a large poderosa pine at the very top of the route. If you reach the seeping spring\\bridge on your right as you walk up river on the riverwalk trail, you've gone about 200 yards too far. Once you locate the route, wade across the river and locate the bolted slab that at its top takes you through bushes and dirt before arriving at the true base of the wall, and the start of pitch 2. This slab marks the start of the route. You can avoid this first pitch altogether by scrambling up the dirty slabs and bushes about 100 yrds down stream and carefully traversing over to the start of pitch 2. Rappel the route for your descent. You can rap with a single 70 from the top of pitch 5 (although you may need to sling a bush to rap the last slab of pitch one). If you climb all the way to the rim, you likely need two 60m ropes to rap, and the large pine at the top is slung to begin your decent."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,a179be65-80be-53f2-bedd-51abac186a4f","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","Riverside Walk Trail & Zion Narrows"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.9483,37.2856]},"bbox":[-112.94886516544088,37.28515033981814,-112.94773483455913,37.28604966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106609209","area_id":"oXm+ZYC+U/K+3VGrrBhqTw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-112.94886516544088,37.28515033981814],[-112.94773483455913,37.28515033981814],[-112.94773483455913,37.28604966018186],[-112.94886516544088,37.28604966018186],[-112.94886516544088,37.28515033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.077Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:49.776Z"}
