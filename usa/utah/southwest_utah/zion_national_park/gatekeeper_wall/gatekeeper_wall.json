An off-size hand crack leads up to a V slot and to the start of the main corner.\n\nThe 2nd pitch was one of the best finger cracks I've ever done. Continue up the dihedral to the top of a prominent tower, which was just 25' from the rim. Lots of loose rock was trundled from this top section as we rappelled off. If you want to go to the top of the formation, climb a 5.6 R pitch. There are no anchors here...you'll need to walk West to the Gatekeeper Crack and rap that route. The first 4 pitches offer the best quality, but going to the top is still well worth it.\n\nThere are no summit anchors so it might be best to rap down the\n\nGatekeeper Crack\n\n.","protection":"One #0 TCU\n\nThree #1 TCU\n\nFour #2 TCU\n\nThree #3 TCU\n\nTwo #.75 Camalot\n\nThree #1 Camalot\n\nThree #2 Camalot\n\nThree #3 Camalot\n\nTwo #4 Camalot\n\nOne #4.5 Camalot\n\nOne #5 Camalot\n\nNuts\n\n60m ropes","location":"See photo"},"__v":0},{"_id":"xjaYAGh7Xme+RW17lknDmQ==","name":"Gatekeeper Crack","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Dave Jones, Brian Smoot & Chris Owens - Oct. 2006","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.97265,37.25928]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106111367","mp_crag_id":"106111359","climb_id":"xjaYAGh7Xme+RW17lknDmQ==","areaRef":"H3br3u4VV1ikjXlSsvmn8w=="},"content":{"description":"Ascend the clean, excellent crack system behind the pillar for 6 steep aid pitches to the top.
