Really deserves 1.5 stars.\n\nThis climb is on the southwest buttress of\n\nRed Arch Mountain\n\nand consists primarily of a series of left-facing corners. It can be best seen from about half-way between the Zion Lodge bus stop and the Grotto bus stop.\n\nP1\n\nClimb the finger crack (5.8) then bushwhack up a ledgy area and establish a belay.\n\nP2\n\nWalk around bushes for about 50-100' until another rock step.\n\nP3\n\nMake a 5.7 move up a corner using pockets then follow a right-leaning ramp to a two-bolt belay at the base of the Afro cracks.\n\nP4\n\n(5.11, 130') Thin fingers (crux) up the cracks leads to a left-leaning corner system (mostly hands with a move or two of 5.10) which ends at a ledge below a wide, sandy 30' corner with anchors visible at its top.\n\nTraverse straight right here (5.6 slabbing), past a pin, up a 3\" corner then traverse back left to the previously-visible slings. Deft rope management is required during these traverses to avoid potentially killer rope drag which could prevent maintaining a tight rope as the second follows the crux (which is just off the previous belay ledge).\n\nP5\n\n(5.9, 100') Follow the chimney (bolt) up right, then left (bolt) to an interesting exit move.  Belay at a ledge with bolts.  Note that the original aid line is to the left of the free version described here; the two lines near each other at the chimney exit.\n\nP6\n\n(5.10, 100')  Follow the bombay chimney whose continuous difficulty is mitigated by frequent opportunities to place non-wide gear.  A wild exit move onto jugs leads to 5.8 face climbing past two bolts and a 10' 5.7 traverse right to a bolted anchor at the base of a long, clean corner.\n\nP7\n\n(5.10, 170') Follow the corner as it steepens (spooky 5.8 on friable flakes) until after about 80', before the corner becomes vertical and very clean, a finger crack diagonals onto the left face.\n\nFollow the finger crack (~9+) with more snappy flake footholds until it becomes a vertical, wide, hand crack.  Follow the hand crack (mainly 2.5 - 3.5 Friends) to a bolted anchor in an alcove.  This is a classic pitch will get better as the breakable flakes are \"consigned to the void.\"\n\nP8\n\n(5.9, 80') Follow a left-arching slot/chimney to easy face climbing which ends at another bolted anchor. The good climbing ends at this point.\n\nP9\n\n(5.8, 70') Up a mossy, barely-protected 5.7 corner to the base of a large pillar. Tunnel behind the pillar (challenging for the claustrophobic and/or wide bodied) then up another easy corner to a ledge with two bolts.\n\nP10\n\n(5.9R (5.5X), 80') Find a way over the short cliff above the anchor.  We chose a spot about 25' right of the anchor where it was possible to get pro for the 5.9 move.  Follow low-angled super choss until you reach a tree you can belay from.  At this point you are on the shoulder of\n\nRed Arch Mountain\n\n; several hundred feet of class three from the summit.","protection":"One each 1-8 Rocks\n\nTwo each blue Alien - #2 Friend\n\nThree each #2.5 - #3.5 Friend\n\nOne each #3.5, #4, #4.5 Camalot\n\nLong slings and quickdraws","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"hfyVRDPcXHirmV5vkjT5ug==","name":"Shune's Buttress","yds":"5.11+","grades":{"yds":"5.11+","french":"7a"},"fa":"Steve Chardon and Dave Jones September 1980","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.94913,37.25533]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105880156","mp_crag_id":"105880153","climb_id":"hfyVRDPcXHirmV5vkjT5ug==","areaRef":"9vfnxKz4UBGNMFx8fKX9dw=="},"content":{"description":"Considered\n\nBa. The Rostrum\n\nof Zion. I think it's close, but not quite.  Does have the same grade, a bit shorter, but has a nice wide pitch to it to boot.\n\nAfter scrambling to the base, the first pitch starts up an obvious left-facing corner with a wide pod at the start.\n\nP1\n\n(5.11+) Climb the wide pod to the long section of sustained 1-1.5\" crack.  Ledge halfway up with anchors on the left, but you can continue to the ledge, about 160' up.  The last 20' of the pitch are classic Zion funky climbing, hard 5.11.\n\nBelay on ledge with fixed nut and bolt with rap slings.\n\nP2\n\n(5.9 or 5.10) Two options:  Climb a groove/chimney/funky thing for 60' to another ledge at 5.9 or step right to a drilled pin and climb the nice 5.10 finger and thin hands crack to the same ledge.\n\nI prefer the second option.\n\nP3\n\n(5.10++)  Get yer offwidth skills and groveling gloves on for this one, and leave your helmet behind so you don't get it stuck.   Chimney up the obvious corner until it starts to pinch down—don't clip the bolt in the bowels, instead place a #4 Camalot (old) up above your head and try and figure out how to slide out to the outside of the bombay and switch to stacks and fist jams. After this the pitch gets way easier: sustained hands and big hands.\n\nThree belay options: short pitch on drilled pin anchors on right; longer pitch on hanging stance with bolts on left (150') or simul-climb the last 30 feet of easier chimney to chockstone belay off of bolts (215') at top of chimney where the sort-of tower meets the main cliff.\n\nP4\n\n(5.11-) Clip a bolt up and left of anchor and continue face climbing up and left on positive holds to obvious bolted belay near arete.  40' long—not much gear after bolt, but way easier to anchor.\n\nP5\n\n(5.11+)  One of the best pitches anywhere!  Downclimb from anchor about 10' then step left around arete and span out to the finger crack on the face.  Backclean your gear for about 15 feet; not too hard, mostly fingers with some feet.  Crank up the steepening finger to big finger to tight hands crack through the roof, with the occasional face hold. Go for another 50' over the roof to an alcove with a bolt and add a #1 or #2 camalot for the anchor.  About 100' long.\n\nP6\n\n(5.9) Handcracks and face holds forever on this left-trending, 165' pitch.  Watch out for bad rock; climb carefully.

There is currently a dead tree about 10 feet up the crack. Start with thin hands which quickly becomes wider. This leads to a spectacular thin hands crack in the left-hand wall. Next, you'll follow a large flake until a bolt appears out left. Clip the bolt and head left to a good ledge and a 2-bolt anchor.\n\nP4\n\n(5.8, 60') Down climb to a ledge at the base of the chimney.
