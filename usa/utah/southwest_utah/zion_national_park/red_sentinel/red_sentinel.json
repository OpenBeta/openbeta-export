Incredibly the first ascent took only 3 days...far ahead of it's time considering the gear and the unknown nature of climbing on sandstone.\n\nJeffs description: \"Climb up cracks and dihedrals for 12 pitches until about 100' below a very large overhang. Pendulum left from a bolt and enter the upper crack system. Follow this to the left of the overhang, then ascend to a broken area with trees. One pitch above this broken area, leave the main crack and chimney system and enter cracks formed by large flakes on the right. This flake system and the cracks above lead to the final overhanging pitch\"\n\nDescent: \"Walk off the back of the summit for a short way, then scramble down (east) into a large couloir which forms the left hand edge of the face. 7 rappels and more scrambling lead to the ground.\"","protection":"Standard wall rack including pitons.
