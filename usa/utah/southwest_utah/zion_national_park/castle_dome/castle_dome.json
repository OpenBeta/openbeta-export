Near the end, the ledge gets rather interesting with friction moves along a big drop. It's possible to belay off a big tree and sling small bushes for the friction traverse. I think a 30 m barely gets you to another tree one can belay off of. Continue south and angle up as the terrain eases onto the SE ramp. Scramble up the ramp to the summit hoodoo.\n\nDESCENT: descend the ramp and try to aim a rappel back to the belay tree at the start of the ledge crux. We were able to descend with a single rope rap and avoid bush snag.","protection":"Sling some bushes, rap some trees","location":"Same approach as for Behunin Canyon. Start as for Angel's Landing (check the shuttle schedule) and head up Walter's Wiggles until the Scout Lookout. Take the turn North on the West Rim trail. After about 2.5 miles from the junction, reach the head of Behunin and descend, scrambling left as necessary to keep it casual.\n\nThe canyon will take a 90 deg turn east towards a dryfall. Leave the canyon here and scramble up dirt and red slabs south over a small hill. You should be NE of Castle Dome with Behunin dropping away parallel to your path on the east."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,c9f9271e-6ddf-50c3-b652-acd2c4fd408c","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","Castle Dome"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.97059,37.26652]},"bbox":[-112.97115502220943,37.26607033981816,-112.97002497779059,37.26696966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112816264","area_id":"yfknHm3fUMO2UqzSxP1AjA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.585Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:01.785Z"}
