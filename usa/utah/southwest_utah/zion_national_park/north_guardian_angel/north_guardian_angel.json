From there follow four pitches of 4th class climbing up the ridge to the top. Be careful where you sit, the belay spots are covered with ants that want this climb to their own, and they'll let you know that. Some of the sandstone can be slick with a think layer of dirt on this climb.","protection":"Leave the rack at home, because there are almost no places to place gear.  The climbing is easy enough that it isn't critical to rope up for the climb.  There are anchors on trees along the way up that you can rope up a second, but mostly these are used for setting up a rappel.  Take a 60m rope.\n\nHowever, if you are on the more careful side or like placing gear, bring a light rack with a few small pieces of pro, it may come in handy. In addition some bail gear may be a good idea. Most of the pitches on this climb are very long if you stay roped up. It is not possible to rappel from belay station to belay station with a 60M or even 70M rope.","location":"From the end of the Northgate Peaks trail, find a small climbers trail that eventually dissapates, and head strait to North Guardian Angel, the peak inbetween the other two.  Descend the same route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,115be4d9-3365-5a22-a889-381669064ea7","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","North Guardian Angel"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.05772,37.31656]},"bbox":[-113.05828539814223,37.316110339818145,-113.05715460185777,37.317009660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106931341","area_id":"EVvk2TNlWiKoiTgWaQZOpw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.081Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:00.366Z"}
