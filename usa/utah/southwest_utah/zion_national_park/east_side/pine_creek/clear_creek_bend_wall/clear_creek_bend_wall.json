Identify the pine tree at the top of the first pitch. This is your belay and rap anchor, positioned slightly left of the upper end of this portion of the crack. 3.5 - 4 Camelot is useful before stepping left to the tree.\n\nImportant hand a foot holds were cleaned during my climb but clean as you feel required. Several large plates sit on the sand near the transition to the pine tree so do not use them or remove if the Â lower trail is clear and safe for route cleaning.\n\nThe approach hike is wonderful as it follows the creek bed through narrowing sections of overhanging rock.","protection":"0.5 - 3.5 Camelot","location":"Clear Creek pullout section of Pink Creek is just a few parking spots east of the east side of the main tunnel.\n\nLeft of a large scoop in the creek wall that faces north towards the road, notice a narrow chimney start to a finger and hand crack. A bit tough to see this first pitch from the road due to its position in this section of the narrow canyon. Look for a pine tree that indicates the rap station."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,6ba629c9-c7de-5109-ab9a-ddb15e52dba6,bde0a098-7575-586a-9ffb-fddc66f79266,a2ad4dbd-1051-5b70-aaa9-d310ecea7e66","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","East Side","Pine Creek","Clear Creek Bend Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.933,37.21288]},"bbox":[-112.93356462026375,37.21243033981814,-112.93243537973625,37.21332966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120932412","area_id":"oq1NvRBRW3CqqdMQ7Op+Zg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.584Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:01.254Z"}
