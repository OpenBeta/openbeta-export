The boulder is awesome though - perfect sitstart, Left hand on a cool low pinch, right hand on the sidepull.\n\nStand up to a left hand decent yet somewhat far crimp, right foot up in one of the funky holes. Get the core thight and adjust right hand on a sharp crimp. Then crux - big throw to a right crimp/pinch. Then feet up (i matched but on the actual send not) and top out is ok.
