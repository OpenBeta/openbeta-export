Great problem involving layback transitions using the lower rails and fancy foot work. Transitions range from the feeling of V1-V5. Work from the start to finish or enjoy working each section. The last few moves can be started from a standing position for an Easter problem thatâ€™s still at least V3-V4. Finish is when you turn the point and stand on the slab down climb.","protection":"Good landing. Pads are an option for the finish","location":"Looking at the East-Northeast point of the Angled Crack Boulder, you will find a lower angled set of rails that follow the lower overhang to an obvious point just before finishing on the slab.\n\nStart on the right hand side of the base of the main crack or choose your own I start to make the line longer or shorter.
