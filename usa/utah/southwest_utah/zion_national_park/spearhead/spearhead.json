It is easily scoped from the vicinity of the Zion Lodge.Start at a right-angling ramp system below the main corner. As of this writing there is a fixed rope midway up the ramp.\n\nP1\n\n(4th class, 200+') Clamber up the ramp to a large ledge. The ledge contains a tree with rap slings. Above the ledge is a Red Rocks-like face with some drilled angles.\n\nP2\n\n(5.9 sandbag, 60') My partner and I thought this was the best and hardest pitch on the climb. Follow the drilled angles to a ledge.\n\nP3\n\n(5.8, 60') Follow a right-facing chimney/corner to a bushy ledge. This pitch is sensibly combined with the previous. Once the entire party is at the ledge, follow a vague trail clockwise about 50' through the bushes and establish a new belay at the base of the main wall.\n\nP4\n\n(5.10, 50-200') Step right a few feet and ascend a groove which eventually reaches the corner. The groove is allegedly the crux of the entire climb.\n\nP5-P8\n\nor\n\nP9\n\n. Continue up the corner which contains several fixed belay/rap stations and the occasional drilled angle. Belay as appropriate. It is possible to link pitches in this section.The corner also contains some good ledges but alas, these aren't always where the good anchors are. The lower part of the corner contains a lot of 5.8 and easier chimneying; the upper part mostly 5.9-ish hands/stemming.\n\nLast Pitch\n\n(5.9 R ,120') From the slings at the top of the corner move the belay up a bushy ramp for about 30' and climb a 5\" layback crack system that slims to hands (5.9). The crack eases into deteriorated blocks to a large roof. Pass an interesting hueco around the right side of the roof and continue up a 5.8 corner with scant pro. Use caution on the brittle rock. Top out the sub-summit and build a gear anchor.","protection":"One each 1-7 Rock\n\nOne each green & yellow Alien\n\nTwo each #1-#3.5 Friend\n\nOne each #4 Camalot\n\nDepending on your comfort level in chimneys, you may want more wide gear (e.g. #4.5 and/or #5 Camalots).","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,82cfc6a0-4fd5-5430-89c0-363dc1969e10","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","Spearhead"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.95726,37.25837]},"bbox":[-112.95782496106949,37.25792033981814,-112.9566950389305,37.258819660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717045","area_id":"gs/GoE/VVDCJwDY9wZaeEA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:21.520Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:15.658Z"}
