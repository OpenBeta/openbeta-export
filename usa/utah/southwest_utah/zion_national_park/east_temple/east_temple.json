There is a nice tree directly above and behind the route which is great for top roping, but between the tree and the route is a large boulder with a very sharp edge which gave my rope a core shot while I TR soloed the route. this was just something that I tried to do after work one day, and if you want a funky/bush wacky/logistical/60ft/out of the way crack, this might be the one for you.
