First pitch follows double hand cracks that lead up and into the bottom of a long chimney.  Pitch two is an exciting chimney that varies in width from tight to wide stemming and some hand cracks around chockstones and ends at a ledge.  Pitch three has two options from the ledge, left is a 5.8 OW and right was easy stemming.  Both options lead up to easier terrain with lots of loose rock until you reach a final short crux to top the route.
