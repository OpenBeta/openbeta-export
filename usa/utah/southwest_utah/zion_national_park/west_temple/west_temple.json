The route, Back Where it All Begins (VI 5.11a A3+), follows the obvious diagonal line up the center of the wall facing Springdale. We spent 12 days completing the route, rappelling on April 22, 8 nights were spent on the wall. The route involved 16 60-meter rope-stretching pitches with bolted belays. Eighty percent of the lower wall was great free climbing, with little aid necessary. Almost all of the last eight pitches required thin aid. Expect 4-5 nights on the wall if hauling water, food and gear.......\n\nSee topo below in photos.","protection":"Many of the headwall pitches are 180'-200' in length. I think it was the 13th and 14th pitches that required 17+ hammer placements along with an assortment of nuts and cams. Bird Beaks, knifeblades, lost arrows, a assortment of angles and hooks(Ibis) were required to get up this monster of a wall. At least 150 carabiners! Thin nuts to large offwidth gear. There are bolted anchors at the end of each pitch which allow for a direct descent.... Only 3 bolts were placed in the field of climbing!","location":"Southeast face of the West Temple.
