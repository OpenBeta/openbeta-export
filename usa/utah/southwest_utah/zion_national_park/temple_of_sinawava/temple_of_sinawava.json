Dylan and I first worked this climb in September 2018 and definitely scared us a bit.

I remembering tunneling through loose boulders all the size of smart cars when I got stuck 15 ft before the desired ledge. Taking everything off of my harness to throw to the ledge clearly wasn't enough. There's moments when climbing something dangerous where your high risk potential is coming head to head with your frustration. I for sure felt this when I was trying to push off a 300 lb teetering rock that was either going to lift me through the tunnel or chop off my foot. I blacked out and came to on the ledge. I remember two conversations with dylan after pulling him up to that ledge. The first convo was a very educated banter of saying \"That was fucked up!\" back and forth for a few minutes. The other was a serious sit down where I made Dylan promise me he would never tell his mom about what we did that day. Bern (Dylans mom), if you somehow find this post I deeply apologize for the irresponsible decision we made that day and promise to stay away from the dangerous stuff.

Chimney/thrash your way up for about a rope length to a nice stance and belay.\n\nP2\n\n(5.9++) Climb up nice cracks then do some facing climbing clipping fixed pitons and bolts to a large grassy ledge.\n\nP3\n\n(5.0) Traverse left about 100 feet to a black streak on the grassy/manzanita ledge.\n\nP4\n\n( A3) Thin nailing and beaking bring you to a bulge that must be overcome with some trickery (an upside down beak was used here). Cool nailing brings one the belay.\n\nP5\n\n(A1+) The $ pitch. Start up a short bolt ladder to #1 angles and a TCU splitter. Ends at a sloping stance.\n\nP6\n\n(5.8 A2) Pound a KB and some LA's then do a hook move into a right facing corner, make some free moves in the dihedral and gain a great small ledge.\n\nP7\n\n(5.7 A2+) Climb the right traversing bolt ladder, a pendulum brings one into the big obvious left facing corner. Backcleaning methods are recommend until you reach you high point with the bolt ladder. Lots of KB nailing brings you to a outrageous sloping belay stance.\n\nP8\n\n(5.6 A1) Climb the varied splitter that cuts its way through the steep headwall and onto the summit. Eats the cams, don't forget the big cam at the belay; you'll need it!\n\nDescend via The West Rim trail to Angel's Landing trail and cold beer.","protection":"A full Iron rack up to #2 angles, including beaks, bring a hook. Full set of cams up to #5 camalot (doubles are nice for the last pitch). All belays are bolted except the bottom of the 3rd pitch. Bring a drill and add a rawl to each belay.","location":"This route faces east, so morning sun is nice. I would imagine in the spring when the waterfall is going it would be a spectacular position.\n\nAlso this might have the shortest approach of any Zion \"bigwall\" in the main canyon. Park in the\n\nTemple of Sinawava\n\nand take the tourist trail back towards the Narrows. At the first option to take a left towards the river do so. Cross the sandy river, walk about 2 minutes up the bank and you're at the base.\n\nBe prepared to be stared at from sunup to sundown from binocular-wielding tour-ons."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,8de0dcb1-2b4f-5526-abbc-a77a671bf83b","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","Temple of Sinawava"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":3,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":2,"label":"Unknown"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":13,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":10,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":7,"bands":{"unknown":7,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":10,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.94922,37.28494]},"bbox":[-112.94978516048405,37.28449033981814,-112.94865483951594,37.28538966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717048","area_id":"jeDcsStPVSarvKd6Zxv4Ow==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-112.94978516048405,37.28449033981814],[-112.94865483951594,37.28449033981814],[-112.94865483951594,37.28538966018186],[-112.94978516048405,37.28538966018186],[-112.94978516048405,37.28449033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":15,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:21.511Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:25.341Z"}
