Aim for a gully splitting the summit plateau. The gully has a few sandy frictiony spots (5.0) prior to topping out on the ridge (most may want to rap this on the way down). Follow sand and scrub ledges east until a weakness in the summit plateau. Scramble up the summit hoodoo.","protection":"Webbing and rope for raps, slings for bushes.
