I guess you could say it is somewhat manufactured. There are many moki steps on the route. It is a fun route.\n\nFrom the Zion Lodge, Cross the road and take the Middle Emerald Pools trail. Approx. 1/2 mile past the bridge, take the climbers trail on the left. This is about 100' past a \"Do Not Roll Rocks Below\" sign.\n\nRound trip distance: 3.8 miles. Elevation gain: 2,675 feet.\n\nThere are 2 or 3 short technical pitches and a lot of 3rd and 4th class scrambling with a lot of moki steps. The Park recommends an 80 foot rope. Shortly after leaving the Middle Emerald Pools trail, you will come to the start of the route, a 4th class section.\n\nFollow your nose. The route wanders a bit. Look for the old hardware used when this route had cables installed on it. You may also see paint blazes and a lot of moki steps.","protection":"Most people take some gear and a short rope or webbing for the 2 or 3, 5th class sections.
