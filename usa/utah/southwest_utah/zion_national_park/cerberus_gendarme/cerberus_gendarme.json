The free climbing is lower quality than Spaceshot or Moonlight, but is still worthwhile. The belays are set up for aid climbing and create awkward pitch breakdowns. Below is how I would recommend approaching the pitches for free climbing, roughly climbing \"stance to stance\".\n\nPitch 1: 5.13a, 35m\n\nThis pitch starts about 40ft right of the aid bolt ladder. Stem against a tree to reach some good holds. Follow a bunch of fixed pins through two cruxy bulges, finishing on a techy under vert seam. A few small offset micro stoppers can help to pull through the cruxes during your initial foray. There is a comfy belay ledge with bolts atop this pitch.\n\nPitch 2: 5.13b (short ~V8 boulder), 15m\n\nThe bolts on this pitch are poorly engineered and don't follow the climbing very well.. walk right on the ledge for 10 feet and yard up the bolt and fixed pin to clip high. Lower back down to the ledge and walk back to the belay. The free climbing goes straight up from the belay for a few moves and then traverses right past your clipped gear. Once the short boulder problem is over, easy rambling leads to a tricky slab and then a traversing ledge system under the roof.\n\nIf working this pitch, it is best to lower back down from the traverse bolts and not link into the roof pull. There is a small perch stance halfway across the traverse that is useful to conclude the pitch. Closely spaced lead bolts just below this stance work to create a hanging, awkward belay.\n\nPitch 3: 5.12- R, 10m\n\nFrom the traverse stance, continue left along the bolt ladder to the roof pull. This is the aid route crux and has C2 protection, which is more finicky while free climbing past. Pull hard and committing moves out the roof past the infamous broken pin. Just above the roof is a sandy ledge stance out left. This is where the free pitch should end, but keep climbing 20ft up the crack to a fully hanging bolted belay on the right. A stressful ground-up lead!\n\nThis pitch is very short, but includes some of the worst climbing on the route. I thought it was best to keep this pitch short to isolate the jingus climbing, not ruining the fine pitches before and after.\n\nPitch 4: 5.12+, 40m\n\nFor a pure experience, you can lower down 15ft to the sandy stance just above the roof to start your \"stance to stance\" 12+ free pitch. This gives a mega 40m finger crack that goes on forever! If starting at the hanging position, it is probably only mid 5.12. Skip the next hanging belay out left at 100' and keep going through the 5.11 double cracks to a tiny ledge in a steep scoop.\n\nSee the main route page for more detail on the pitches to the top\n\nPitch 5: 5.10c\n\nSlabby thin hands forever to tricky flare climbing. End at a large ledge out right.\n\nPitch 6: 5.8\n\nClimb the left of the two cracks leaving the right side of the ledge. Wide cracks lead to a large ledge.\n\nPitch 7: 5.9\n\nClimb the left of the double cracks through bulgy fingers, then step right to a nice handcrack layback.\n\nPitch 8: 5.10b\n\nLayback and fist jam up the crack to a squeeze chimney, then ramble to a giant tree to belay.\n\nPitch 9: 5.7R\n\nJuggy sport climbing with pins to an unprotected slab. Belay at a small summit tree\n\nDecent:\n\nSee the aid route page. If there is no traffic on route, rappelling back down the pitches is a smoother experience. The summit ridge traverse is really cool, consider hiking out and back even if rapping the route.","protection":"Doubles 0.1-4, extra finger sized cams, RPs","location":"The fine crack system up the right side of Cerberus Gendarme.

What the route lacks in height it makes up for in wonderful aid and free climbing. Bivy ledges atop pitch 5 and on the summit make this an excellent first wall since no portaledge is necessary. Don't forget that a bivy permit is required for all overnight routes! This route was one of the earlier big wall routes done in Zion and was put up by the prolific desert rat Ron Olevsky.\n\nLecture\n\nThe route goes all clean and has good anchors, so leave the pins, hammers and drilling equipment at home. Credit for the fact it can be climbed with only nuts and cams goes to the vision of Ron Olevsky who realized early on that in order to preserve the classic walls of Zion they needed some fixed gear and some constructive scaring.  (I guess that makes this a chipped route?) Otherwise, the route would have become a mess of unclimbable pin scars.\n\nUnfortunately, even when done all clean, the route can still be trashed by the careless cleaning.  So, when trying to decide whether or not to leave a $4.95 nut or whether to get it out with all means necessary, think twice and do the right thing. And it goes without saying, leave all fixed pins in place.\n\nPitch-by-Pitch Beta\n\nNote: there are intermediate/belay anchors in the middle of the first 4 pitches to allow parties to bail safely with one rope. Pitches are described based on skipping the intermediate anchors.\n\nP1\n\n(5.6 C2 or C1, 35m) Unlike other Zion big walls there are no nasty pitches getting to the good rock.  However, there are two choices for the start. Climb the tree to some fixed pins and interesting free climbing and belay on a nice ledge or climb the bolt ladder on the left which requires some top-stepping.  The tree start is very interesting and was the original start.  It also requires a little 5.6 traverse to start pitch 2.  The bolt ladder start is easier and more straightforward.\n\nP2\n\n(C2, 41m) This is possibly the crux of the route.  Climb some fixed gear up to the roof and traverse left under a roof.  The traverse culminates in hanging on a fixed Rurp. Exciting! It's probably better to use the ease-on-to-it method of testing rather than bounce testing, which will inevitably loosen the fixed gear.  Continue by aiding through the C2 roof.  A creatively-placed 0.5 tricam works nicely here.\n\nAfter the roof, start cruising up the beautiful crack that splits the walls.  This crack eats nuts. Ignore the first set of anchors on the right.  Belay at chains on the right side of the crack.  This pitch is very exciting to clean since it traverses. The haul bag will probably get stuck on the roof, so have the second wait there and flip the bag over the roof (Big Wall Tip #23).\n\nP3\n\n(C1, 42m) This is what it's all about. A beautiful crack on a beautiful wall with good exposure. Aid climbing never gets any better than this! Put stuff in the crack and cruise. Pass the midway belay station and continue to a nice ledge. This pitch goes free at 5.11-.\n\nP4\n\n(5.10, 45m) Get out the cams and climb a sandy crack.  This can be aided or free climbed at 5.10.  End at Halfway Ledge which is not a good place to bivy.\n\nP5\n\n(5.8+, 25m) Choose the best off width climber and get out the phat cams.  Climb the four inch crack and be mindful of a loose block before the Virgin Berth Bivy Ledge. There's room for two people here. Next, eat all the Chef Boyardee.\n\nP6\n\n(5.9, 27m) This makes an interesting wake-up call after the bivy.  Climb a 5.9 crack on the left then choose either a 5.6 crack on the left or a sweet 5.8 hand crack on the right.  This section can be french freed if necessary.\n\nP7\n\n(5.9, 26m) Climb a weird, wavy and wide fist crack up into a short squeeze.  Leapfrog gear as necessary.  Belay at a very large tree.\n\nP8\n\n(5.9, 26m) The original route rated this pitch T4, as in climb the tree and swing onto the juggy wall to the left. Luckily, a variation exists that climbs excellent jugs up the steep wall with fixed pins.  Pumpy! Belay near the lip at a manzanita bush, fixed pin, and crack where you can make an anchor.  A nice bivy can be had on the Summit Prow.\n\nP9\n\n(5.6) To get to the summit, a little free climbing is necessary.  This last, little pitch is nasty to haul.  It might be possible to do this as part of pitch 8, but the summit prow is very cool to hang out on.\n\nFree Version\n\nThis route has been freed.  That's something to think about while happily hanging in the aiders.","protection":"Answer 1\n\n: Standard Clean Big Wall Rack.\n\nAnswer 2\n\n: Olevsky's original recommendation - 25 wired nuts 1/4 inch to 3/4 inch. 25 to 35 nuts and Friends to 5 inches.\n\nAnswer 3\n\n: A more exact rack:\n\nThree sets rocks, mostly medium, no RPs (extra #5).

First crux is at the seam with many more until the chains. Was rated PG-13 because of tricky placements and loose rock. Do not finger jam left of small pillar about 20ft up or you may pry it on to your belayer. This is a good Zion offwidth test piece. If you can master this climb then the bigger wall climbs with scattered 5.10 off widths will be much lighter on your soul.\n\nThis route was named after the an event that occurred at the first Gettin' Western Party that was put on by the Wiley Bois. After a long night of fungus indulging and tequila shootin' one of the wiley guests decided to drive a car in a 6 ft ditch, then fist fight her way to glory. The Bernie Breakdown was a hard one to combat. Many of the wiley bois found themselves bruised and caught in spiraling hysterical laughter. Good Vibes only. Put up those fists for this one kiddos and get ready to stack em' up as you inch your way to the top.\n\nRated PG-13 Due to loose block in the crack, but don't be scared away the pro is actually really good and is not dangerous if approached with caution.","protection":"Doubles from #4s to #5s, 3 to 4 #6's, & 1 VG9","location":"Noticeably large crack located left of cave crack, can be seen from the big bend stop #8"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,12910103-2b32-5de1-b2b4-e360e3b26de3","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","Cerberus Gendarme"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":3,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c/d"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":18,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":8,"advanced":7,"expert":1}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":8,"advanced":7,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.94437,37.27435]},"bbox":[-112.94493508097199,37.273900339818134,-112.943804919028,37.27479966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717009","area_id":"EpEBAysyXeGytONg47Jt4w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":18,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.584Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:16.585Z"}
