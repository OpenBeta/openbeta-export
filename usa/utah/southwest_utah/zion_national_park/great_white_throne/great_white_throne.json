Trail just past the Ponderosa Ranch. Follow signs to trailhead.  Hike takes about 2.5 - 3 hours. Follow trail for about 3 miles, passing the Hidden Canyon drainage and up a small rise. Soon you can see the other side of the mesa, looking south into Pine Creek as the trail passes close to that side. Several hundred yards after this you can see a grassy area below stretching north. Leave the trail and hike north along the top edge of the rise for nearly 1/2 mile to a slight drop. From here you will see a tall prominent  dead tree (see photo) and the top of the GWT and it's hondoos on the summit. At the dead tree, hike mostly east down a clearing to the edge of Hidden Canyon. Hike north along the edge here for about 5 minutes to a big pine tree marking the descent gully to the base of the Throne.  Descend this slick rock gully which leads to the left side of the South face. Bringing a topo map is prudent."},"__v":0},{"_id":"UXSIMR4IU06jnad4WNkTeg==","name":"Old South Face, Left Side","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"W.

First climbed in June of 1927 by W. H. W. Evans by himself.  After making it to the summit and lighting a fire for proof of topping out, he got most of the way down and slipped and feel 200' on the descent.  He was rescued by some of the Park staff, suffering from delirium and a cracked skull, lying in the bushes, after a few days.\n\nThe second ascent of Evans' route was also a loner solo climber who had walked from California to Zion named Donald Orcutt on June 30th, 1931.  He is reported to have died just after this on a solo of The Cathedral.  But, I heard from the third ascent party that he was killed on the descent from the Great White Throne.\n\nProbable third ascent (as told to me) was in the late 40's by a team from Brigham Young University lead by Don Decker (Decker was later on the first ascent of the Direct South Buttress of Mount Moran in 1953).\n\nFourth recorded ascent was Herb and Jan Conn from the Needles of South Dakota fame in 1949.\n\nI got sparse information from Don Decker - who mentored my introduction into climbing - in the late 60's and in 1974 made an ascent of probably where this old route goes.  Not sure, many possibilities exist - none of them safe!  None of them worth repeating!  We climbed to the left of the new Smoot Diagonal Route.\n\nBlaine Brown and I drove around in my VW Beatle for most of a day on the back dirt roads of Zion's east side.  Ran into a hermit that tried to run us off 'his' property (might have been Park land).  After finding out we all had spent time in New Zealand he became our new best friend and told us exactly where to drive and park for the approach to the south side of GWT.  We camped at the VW and did the climb the next day.   This old and horrible dirt road may share some parts of the current Deer Trap Trail.","protection":"We carried some pitons, runners and old crude nuts.  We belayed off of less than stable or secure bushes and small trees.  We sort of down climbed, lowered and rappelled the route in reverse.  Decker had cautioned me to take two long ropes for the descent - which we did.  But, Blaine left the second rope on the ground at the start of the climb instead of in his pack.  Surprised us both on top.\n\nThis ascent in the fall of 1974 had ALL of the elements of a 'for sure' disaster.  Lucky to have an extended learning curve in those days.","location":"On Goggle Earth, you can see the exact south side of GWT and get an idea of several roads/trails to get to the gully described by Smoot on the Diagnoal.  Descend the gully and head up what ever looks reasonable on the left side of the south face, following a line of bushes and trees."},"__v":0},{"_id":"Cf8iRDRkWzuCRy460lmOPg==","name":"Northwest Face","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Fred Beckey, Galen Rowell & Pat Callis in 1967","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.94116,37.26107]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107408953","mp_crag_id":"107408798","climb_id":"Cf8iRDRkWzuCRy460lmOPg==","areaRef":"vmBzfIsFWIy4y1O70xoX8w=="},"content":{"description":"Begin in the obvious chimney at the left side of the NW face, climb up & right to the midway, brushy ledges.
