This line is\n\nDisco Inferno\n\n. The original topo for\n\nDisco Inferno\n\nfeatures an image of\n\nJohn Travolta\n\n,\n\nstrutting his stuff, adding a further touch of mystique to this intriguing line. Everyone's climbing experience and perspective, particularly in Zion, is different, but it's fair to say that\n\nDisco Inferno\n\nis a small step up from the traditional trade routes. While the majority of the climbing is easy and straight forward, expect to find some sand and adventure.\n\nA good, updated, hand-drawn topo is available from SuperTopo at this\n\nlink\n\n. Below, is a brief description of the pitches.\n\nP1\n\nFree climb the right facing dihedral and pendulum to the crack system on the right. Continue via good 5.9 free climbing or C1 aid to a ledge with a couple of bolts. It's possible to link this pitch with the next pitch for an approximate 190 foot pitch.\n\nP2\n\nFrom the ledge, free climb (5.8) up the left-facing dihedral which will open up. At a high point, again pendulum right to a crack system. Easy free climbing (5.7) takes you to a ledge with two bolts at the base of a large chimney.\n\nP3\n\nThe \"birth canal.\" Head to the back of the chimney until you can gain purchase and begin your vertical adventure. A flake inside this squeeze chimney provides protection. Although only given a 5.8 free rating, expect it to feel harder unless you are used to this sort of grovel fest. 2/3 of the way up the pitch you have to exit the chimney before reentering the chimney higher. Finish at a large, sloping ledge with a bolted anchor. This ledge connects with the\n\nDesert Shield\n\nbivy ledge that features a charcoal grill.\n\nP4\n\nMake a 5.9 free move to step right into a crack that turns into an awkward left facing corner that is aided at C1 with small gear. At the top of the corner free climb to the right where you find a bolted anchor at a small ledge below the headwall.\n\nP5\n\nLet the games begin. Free climb through some precarious blocky, sandy terrain to reach the headwall. This initial headwall pitch is ascended via a series of holes and filled holes (a mix of angles and bolts). There is also some mandatory hooking and a short section of crack with C2 aid climbing.\n\nMy understanding is that the first ascentionists drilled holes and inserted heads. Subsequent ascents have hooked the holes, resulting in many blown out holes. Other ascents have utilized long cheat sticks to skip these holes. And there has been some discussion about filling these holes. Whatever method you choose, ascend this \"pseudo bolt ladder\" to a bolted, hanging belay below a large roof.\n\nUPDATE FROM STEVEN SADLER: This route now has shiny new hardware up the bolt ladder pitch (pitch 5). Me and a buddy (Jordan Schaefer) went up and drilled and put in new 1/2\" bolts in all the old blown out holes.\n\nP6\n\nA final section of holes and filled holes leads to a sandy roof where a large cam is required. The original topo describes this as a \"sandy, rotten roof.\" Above the roof, find quality and enjoyable clean aid climbing (C2). End at another bolted, hanging belay.\n\nP7\n\nContinue up the crack, going through one small roof at 5.10 or C1, ending at a nice ledge with a bolted anchor.\n\nP8\n\nTop out the climb via a short 5.9 or C1 pitch.\n\nTo descend, rap the route. I know that some people advocate leaving fixed lines on the steeper sections of routes such as\n\nDesert Shield\n\nto aid in the descent, but we did not find it necessary on\n\nDisco Inferno\n\n, although we did leave some biners to help reach anchors on the lower headwall.","protection":"Double set of nuts with offsets recommended. Triple set of small to medium cams, double set of hand size and up and one each of big cams, such as new #5 and #6 Camalots.

This is an excellent step up from the standard Zion trade routes but is really not that serious.\n\nThe anchors are all bolted and it is typical to rap the route to descend. I have read that it is wise to fix a rope between the 6th and 4th pitch anchors for retreat (which we did not do). You can do this rap with 60 meter ropes and land on a ledge a little down and right of the P4 anchors, which you can then scramble up to.\n\nFor competent and experienced parties there should be no problem doing this route in a day. To find the base of the route hike up towards it and aim for the base of a stunning handcrack on the second pitch.\n\nP1\n\nIs a dirty short grovelly bit that is soloable at about 5.4 or so. There are bolted anchors on top of a ledge.\n\nP2\n\nStart on runout 5.7 face climbing to a sport-bolted section of 5.11a which is not really aidable (but you could always just pull on the bolts to make it easier). This leads to the base of a crack that goes from fingers to wide hands at 5.9. This 60m pitch is amazing.\n\nP3\n\nClimb a 5.10 handcrack left of the belay.\n\nP4\n\nA 5.9, left-facing chimney to some easier scrambling.\n\nP5\n\nClimb a bunch of blocky ledges to a steep, and somewhat sandy lieback flake crack system that ends to the left of the obvious prow (5.9). Pitches 3 through 5 are all pretty short and you can take your pick on which two to link, just beware of drag.\n\nP6\n\nAid the bolt ladder with one hook move up the overhanging prow, around the corner, and then to a set of anchors at the base of the headwall crack. A few rivet hangers are handy.\n\nP7\n\nThe first pitch of the amazing crack that splits the headwall. C2+ micro-nutting fun; lots of aliens and offset aliens are good too. This pitch is fiddly and sustained, but never too hard as there is always a good cam or nut before a thin section.\n\nP8\n\nThe second headwall pitch that begins easy, but packs a punch. Aid C2 for a while up to a bolt under an overlap. There are opportunities for Camalots throughout this section. Eventually it gets thinner and some hook moves and bathooks are necessary to move right to another crack. This is the C3 crux of the route. A couple more thin micro scars lead to mandatory 5.6 steep free climbing to the belay. This section is extremely loose. Beware of huge loose blocks, but it is possible to climb around them.\n\nP9\n\nDidn't get to do this because of a huge thunderstorm that pummeled us and sent us to the ground in retreat. Apparently a C1 crack to a 5.6 ramp to a short bolt ladder to the top.\n\nHave great fun on this amazing route!","protection":"For the first half of the route (which is free) you will want a standard free rack up to a number 4 Camalot. Take doubles in the hand-size pieces.\n\nFor the aid, you will want tons of micro nuts, tons of regular nuts, offset Aliens, and a couple other hooks like a cliffhanger, as well as all the usual stuff.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"/gAhFFf6VnyL9nXrgjMmvA==","name":"[Redacted]","yds":"5.11+","grades":{"yds":"5.11+","french":"7a"},"fa":"Gaar Lausman, Janette Tank  2009","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.94516,37.27624]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"106376830","mp_crag_id":"105717101","climb_id":"/gAhFFf6VnyL9nXrgjMmvA==","areaRef":"g6HqdGu5WeaIc5mKxuAb+w=="},"content":{"description":"Climb nice left facing corner starting with tight hands, to good hands, to wide hands, navigate through an interesting wide section and prepare for the offwidth fight from hell.
