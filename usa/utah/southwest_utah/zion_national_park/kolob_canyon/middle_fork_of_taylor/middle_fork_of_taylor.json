Without doubt, an ascent of the Gut Pile will be fun and memorable! This route is fully equipped and cleaned for a safe ascent. If you carry out the rack for Astrolizard - consider bivying on the Lizard Ledge and climb this the next day - the rack is mostly the same.\n\nP1: 5.11. 59m. Move up and right from belay, up the ramp to a ledge below a bolt and the giant flake looming above. Place a nest of gear and pull cruxy face moves, clip the bolt then get established in the flake. There is an optional comfortable belay 45 m up that's equipped with one bolt if you run out of gear and / or energy, but climb to the top of the flake for the full value experience. There are numerous protection bolts where the flake is too thin for good gear making this pitch reasonable. The top of the flake is equipped with a two bolt belay.\n\nP2: 5.11-. 50m. Get psyched for the incredibly exposed step-across dynamic lunge into the flaring chimney. Extract yourself out and over the roof and follow the flare up to the increasingly steep corner to a two bolt belay. This pitch is wild!","protection":"Double set from black alien to #3, four #4s, three or four #5s and one #6. Small set of wires w a couple brassies.
