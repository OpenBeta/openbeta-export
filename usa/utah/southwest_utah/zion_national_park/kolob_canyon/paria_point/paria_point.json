The rock quality may not be as good as moonlight, but definitely exceeded my expectations, and far surpassed many other adventure style routes in the Zion area I have been on. There are many large runouts; mainly on good quality face climbing. The climbing is generally pretty easy where there is no pro. As far as the crux pitches, they are pretty stout. Insecure hard technical stemming, felt much harder than say, the crux pitch of moonlight. Although they can be easily aided through with exception to the first crux pitch, in which youll either have to pull some aid trickery or just send it.\n\nP1: ( 5.10 ) Up, left, up\n\nP2: ( 5.10 ) Up and left via face and cracks to a finger and hand crack below the pillar. Traverse right to a stem box. Left at bolt on a ledge to the anchor.\n\nP3: ( 5.9 R ) Long Chimney. Hand and finger size gear.\n\nP4: ( 5.10- ) Up to .5 & .75 crack. Take a right, traverse face in front of large boulder. Gear Anchor\n\nP5: ( 5.12 / 5.11 C2 PG13 ) Hard stemming up to a piton. Crux is before and after piton. Hanging Belay\n\nP6: ( 5.12 ) An extremely short pitch. Out the V-slot and onto the face via more hard stemming. 2 solid bolts protect the crux. Bolted anchor on ledge\n\nCombine P5 & P6 to avoid awkward hanging belay\n\nP7: ( 5.12 ) Long pitch, lots of bolts. More hard stemming to easier and fun 5.11 face. Skip bolted anchor and continue up to large ledge w/ gear anchor. ( #1 & #2 helpful at anchor )\n\nP8: ( 5.9 R ) From ledge climb the dirty crack system to the east to a small ledge where you can face traverse around the large arête. ( there might be a better option of using the crack system in the large corner, but I dont think you can traverse around the arête from that point ) Once around the arête, face climb up to a bolt, then right to a crack, then back left to a piton, then up the stemming corner / face to a crack system in a right facing corner. The crack system will lead to the original anchor, a fixed nut and a piton on a slopping ledge. A much better option is to stop at the ledge on the left right before the original anchor and build a gear anchor.\n\nP9: ( 5.9 R ) Face climb up to the base of the left facing corner with large crack.\n\nP10: ( 5.11- ) Climb the crack on the face and crack in the left facing corner above the belay linking them via face climbing. Climb the bolted face above the crack. Climb past the tree and up to an anchor. Anchor = Piton and hangerless bolt. Use a stopper wire to sling bolt.\n\nP11: ( 5.6 ) Climb patina rail out left, then up and back right to a gear belay.\n\nA 70m rope might barely reach to link p10 & 11 to avoid belay, but it would be a stretch. There arent any good gear options for belays before the top of P11.","protection":"2x green c3 - #2 camalot\n\n1x #3\n\n1x set of stoppers\n\nmany long runners and draws\n\n2x 60m ropes","location":"Approach: Standard south fork approach. Take a left at the second drainage on your left that will lead up to the base of Wind Sand & Stars. There is a faint trail that generally follows the drainage.\n\nDecent: After the last pitch walk up, left then down and back left. There is a large cairn at the start of the rappels.\n\n5 repels off the west face of Paria Point.\n\nAt the first rappel, the next set of anchors is to the north.\n\nAt the base of Paria Point you can scramble down some 3rd and 4th class ( to the west Im assuming )\n\nor you can skirt the base of the cliff heading south via 3 more 60m rappels. Youll have to fight the rope on your way down, but all the pulls are clean and there is very little loose rock. This will lead you pretty close to the base of Spider Finger."},"__v":0},{"_id":"4TxgsWC/WtCR0B/nDn1eqA==","name":"Super Senior","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Nate Brown Spring 2000","type":{"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.18443,37.4544]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106485103","mp_crag_id":"106074781","climb_id":"4TxgsWC/WtCR0B/nDn1eqA==","areaRef":"ME7iVM29W0ucRj2MCP64zw=="},"content":{"description":"I did this route by myself the weekend before college senior year finals.

That being said, it's a great route to do, particularly after you've done the classics in Zion. It can be free climbed at 5.11b or done with some aid at 5.8 C1.\n\nIf you're going to do this route in a day, you will probably want to free most of the route or at least French free the difficult sections.\n\nA good topo is available in the\n\nFifty Favorite Climbs\n\nbook as well as at the Zion Visitor Center.\n\nThe climbing is very straight forward with a number of pitches featuring bolts or drilled angles to protect face climbing features. Some of the face climbing is made more difficult due to fragile rock, but it's the desert so what do you expect?\n\nI'll keep the pitch-by-pitch description to a minimum as it's easy to follow on a topo.\n\nPitches 1 and 2 are easy to link. Pitch 3 climbs the obvious right-facing corner and pitch 4 climbs the face with bolts/angles and some fixed gear. For pitch 5, traverse left from the belay and ascend a short corner to a ledge. From the ledge a crack cuts up and right. You may want to back clean gear from the short corner to prevent rope drag. At the top of pitch 5 is a big ledge.\n\nPitch 6 is the route's crux, 5.11 face climbing protected by bolts/angles. You can connect pitch 6 with pitch 7 which is probably preferable because then you belay at a large ledge, rather than a hanging belay.\n\nPitch 8 has a couple of variations. You climb underneath a loose, junky roof. If you stay low, it's easier than staying high. From there you climb into a left-facing corner to another large ledge where the belay anchors are out left.\n\nPitch 9, the final pitch, seems to be somewhat devious and not totally obvious. We didn't do it so I can't say with certainty which crack it is. There are a number of options that exist and we couldn't decide which one was best. None of the options looked super appealing and we were under the impression that many parties skipped the last pitch or two as the rock quality seems to deteriorate. You're supposed to traverse right to a fixed bolt or pin and into a left-facing corner.","protection":"Double set of cams to #4 Camalot and a set of stoppers. Runners and two ropes.
