Pick one and jam beautiful cracks to the first short, 10b offwidth crux, which protects really well with a 3.5 Camalot.\n\nP2 (5.9+ or easy 5.10) Pitch two goes at 5.9+ or easy 5.10, depending on your height. Cruise up and left from the belay, working through some great .9 terrain until you clip a good bolt on the \"puzzle piece\" before a splitter roof. Surmount the roof, then up more .9 to the second belay.\n\nP3 Begins with some really fun, easy, lower-angled cracks and gets progressively more difficult as you near the chains. Save those green Camalots, ideally one for after the big peapod. The pitch ends on a large ledge, from which you rap off 60 meters to a hanging rap anchor that is below and to the left of the anchor atop pitch 2. Rap another 60 to the ground.","protection":"At minimum, two sets of cams from 3\" to 3.5\" (heavy on green and yellow camalots), a set of stoppers, 8 draws and 5 shoulder length slings.\n\nAll three belays are bolted with bomber bolts.\n\nBring two 60 meter ropes.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,92a8e6fe-7f49-598a-b39a-d013c33e9ad4,9c3dd376-e6d3-5712-931f-c32a6d39cb27,218f6fdf-b5ec-5525-9daa-91a9bf25597e","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Zion National Park","Mount Carmel Tunnel","Headache Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.95855,37.21139]},"bbox":[-112.95911460911384,37.21094033981814,-112.95798539088618,37.211839660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106725747","area_id":"IY9v37XsVSWdqpGpvyVZfg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.087Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:16.211Z"}
