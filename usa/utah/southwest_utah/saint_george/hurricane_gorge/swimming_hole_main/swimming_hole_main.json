Follow the wide crack in the center of the face up through the dihedral finish. Don't be fooled by the grade; expect to run out a couple sections due to poor protection options. I think this adds to the fun factor of the route. Many loose rocks and a few dead bushes were cleaned out. Several questionable hand/foot options remain. Tread cautiously.","protection":"Gear is a standard rack with emphasis on larger pro. Extend the belay from the large boulder a few paces back and to the left. Use a dedicated rope/cordage for a TR anchor or simply belay up your second (recommended).","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,4d2e4bea-0a8e-5969-897d-e8d3ba29183e,bf078078-efc8-59c1-b7dd-f901c0b52c2f,e42c20ab-90a4-5257-928b-128fd7e8b007","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Saint George","Hurricane Gorge","Swimming Hole Main"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.28515,37.19873]},"bbox":[-113.28571451441,37.19828033981814,-113.28458548559001,37.19917966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119786692","area_id":"5Cwgq5CkUleSixKP1+iwBw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:42.786Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:27.376Z"}
