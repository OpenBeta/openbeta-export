Park at the enclosure area and hike north out of the parking lot along the dort road for about 20 mins then when the area opens up a lot and you can see a canyon To the left hike to it. There will be some 4th class scrambling up a chimney which is not too difficult. Which then leads to a ledge which is a little scary to walk across but is safe and easy. Then you hike around the corner to the right for a couple dozen yards. The bolts will be on the left. There might be a tag on The first bolt. Its tagged cause the fourth pitch has not been done yet. Anyways hope you find it easily amd have tons of fun! This route is awesome!!!
