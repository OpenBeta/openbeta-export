There is a short approach ramp (50 feet, 3 bolts) that doesn't really count as a pitch. The first true pitch is a good warm up at 5.11-. The second pitch is the crux and is a test of technical edge skills. The third pitch wanders up and left to a thin section above an overlap (5.11). The last pitch is not to be missed. Easy 5.10 huecos and edges take you up a twisted arete 350' above the canyon.","protection":"Bolts and rap hangers.","location":"Most of the belays are semi-hanging. Rap the route.
