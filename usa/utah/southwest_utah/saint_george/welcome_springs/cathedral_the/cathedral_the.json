Several cruxes and good rests comprise this wonderful pump-fest.\n\nBegin as for\n\nSpeaking in Tongues\n\n(by far a more popular route - though it shouldn't be) on the right side of the cave.  A difficult undercling move that isn't so bad if you can stay glued to the glassy feet leads to better holds.  There's a shallow no-hands knee bar before the route moves right where\n\nTongues\n\nmoves left.  Here you must pass two very poorly placed bolts - they are too low and too far to the right of the climbing, making the clips difficult and the climbing unsettling.  In any case, move right to a huge hueco, then right again to a smaller, but perhaps better one that is home to an abandoned peregrine nest.  Hope that there is a long sling on the next bolt as you move up on some cobbles in a shallow depression on the wall.  A few more moves up and right around an arete-like feature lead to a great stance and opportunity for complete recovery.  Easy stemming up a corner culminates in a big move to a good hole, and another rest before the final run to the chains:  This section is steep and uncharacteristically crimpy, but it also has the nicest rock.  The anchor is tough to clip.\n\nUse a 70m cord and when you lower redirect through a midway chain anchor to land on the starting platform.
