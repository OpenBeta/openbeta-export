Anyway, go back up and from the third bolt head up and right through the crux.  The fourth clip kind of sucks and the holds through the crux suck even more, but it has a really cool sequence if you do it like I did, but you will most likely do it differently because you're taller/shorter/stronger, etc. Assuming you get to this point, gain the slab, do some compression type moves, and join the 5.11b \"Just Left of Paradise\" for the last few bolts.

Originally prepared by Mike Call (presuming a more manageable 5.13- grade), he graciously gifted the line to legendary crimp master Boone Speed (hence the name). Established in 1995, this line was one of the earlier 5.14s in America, and was named one of the five best miniature sport routes in America in Matt Samet's \"Get Shorty\" article for Climbing Magazine.  The bouldering difficulty has been estimated to be around V11, and in fact it has been \"bouldered\" at least twice, though ropes were used to work the line in both cases.\n\nThat said, this wall of pockets and tiny edges is more a test of high intensity Power Endurance than pure power, with twelve-or-so continuos moves and barely an opportunity to clip, let alone shake or chalk.  None of the moves are terribly heinous by themselves, but from the ground to the slab every move is hard.  The climbing is characterized by long lock-offs and precision stabs between tiny edges and 2 or 3 finger pockets.  The entire line could be considered one long crux, but there is a more desperate section passing the first bolt and another leading to the third bolt.","protection":"3 bolts (plus directional) to 2BA.
