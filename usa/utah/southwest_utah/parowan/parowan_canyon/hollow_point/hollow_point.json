A belay bolt was placed off to the right to protect the belayer. At the midway whitish colored roof, the rock is briefly somewhat hollow, but a couple of creative glue ins protect this section well.\n\nPitch #1: Follow the bolted line up the spur to where you can stand on top of the tower. 5.9+, 30m.\n\nRappel the route.","protection":"Many QDs. All bolts, some glue in pitons to a 3 bolt belay on the tower top.\n\nDrilled on lead.","location":"Hollow Point is the bullet shaped conglomerate tower with two prominent little \"heads\" on its pointy summit block. To park completely off of the Canyon Road (best in winter) turn into the well marked turn off for Thunder Ridge Scout Camp. The road is snowed in in the winter months, but offers a convenient pull out park spot. Walk down canyon about 100m on the road to where you can scramble up north to the base of the tower (left side coming up canyon). This is on the other side of the road from the creek so does not require a creek crossing. Some very appealing free standing towers are across the creek."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,ae9fb395-eaa7-5798-a5f6-78ad324346de,ec7b77b7-ee6b-552d-b275-1d1cb570004c,34935d2f-643b-5db0-9c1d-1a7d8aac6dd0,45db5d7f-a3d1-5cf1-81c7-449c385dd80d","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southwest Utah","Parowan","Parowan Canyon","Hollow Point"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.83601,37.73441]},"bbox":[-112.83657857393727,37.73396033981814,-112.83544142606274,37.73485966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117594975","area_id":"Rdtdf6PRXPGBx0ScOF3YDQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:38.925Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:21.182Z"}
