I had left the route alone for several years because their was a red tag.  I took the red tag off last spring because it had turned white due to sun bleaching and no one had ever returned to give it any attention. I spent two full sessions cleaning the route. Their was A LOT of loose Rock. If you get off route you may still encounter some so I recommend a helmet for your belayer.\n\nYou get into the crux of the route about 8 feet up the wall and it doesn't let up until you have clipped the 4th bolt(25 ft). The crux requires powerful committing moves on small but mostly positive holds (V6ish).  After pulling the roof you find an awkward but decent place to catch a shake. Continue through a few  more bolts of good 5.11 climbing (35+ feet). Last 15 ft of the route is a bit disappointing as the route was bolted with the idea of creating a 3 pitch route. So the climbing turns into a 5.9 traverse to the anchors. I recommend back cleaning the traverse after sending, then lowering off a carabiner.\n\nI tried to make the description detailed so anyone can come prepared.  So if it sounds a bit intense its really not too bad. The route climbs well and is well worth the effort.\n\nThe upper pitches need a lot of cleaning and probably an additional bolt or two.  I am unable to dedicate the time into tackling such a large project. I was pleased to have freed the first pitch. If someone takes the time to clean the upper pitches it would make for a great and difficult multi-pitch route.","protection":"Bolts and Rap anchors","location":"the route is found in the cave located on the far west side of the formation.
