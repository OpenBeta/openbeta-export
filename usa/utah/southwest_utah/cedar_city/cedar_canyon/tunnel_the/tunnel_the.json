It just depends on how you use the rail that you traverse.\n\nIf you go high and walk on it, there are a few ankle clippers (ie you reach down and clip the bolt) and the crux is near the start (5.10).\n\nIf you stay low and hand traverse the rail it has big dynamic reaches between holds and bad feet. There are a couple bolts you have to crank up and lock off to clip, but it's do-able. (5.11++)","protection":"A hodge-podge of bolts maybe a drilled pin or two.\n\nQD's","location":"This lies just up the highway from the PyschoSlab about .75 miles, or 10.75 miles from the mouth. You cannot mistake the route it's the only one roadside w/ a tunnel.\n\nIf the river is running high consider your options of how you will get back to shore since you lower down into the drink. A long stick is helpful to pull your leader back in, but this takes 3 or more as the belayer is uphill. If the water is low enough you can always throw some big rocks in to tip toe back on.
