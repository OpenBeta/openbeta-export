The Birth Canal is one crux and the end is a second crux, but endurance over the distance is the true challenge here as no individual section is any harder than 12-/V5 or so. This is without a doubt one of the finest cracks anywhere. It is especially appealing to me because it splits the cave it is in through it's proudest aspect.\n\nThere are many other variations starting at the various cracks and going to either side of the cave, including the one that traverses the jugs into the crack.
