Mantel the shelf, pulling gently (!) on any crimps you might find above it, then enjoy some chossy 5.easy to the top. Go ahead and give yourself a couple extra V points if you're on the shorter side, as setting up for the big move to the jug is likely waaaay harder for you.\n\nThere is also an alternate, easier start that traverses in from the right on good crimps (there's a rose move if you're into that sort of thing), which deposits you right at the jug.\n\nI believe I watched the FA, but who knows? lemme know if I'm wrong and I will correct.","protection":"","location":"The obtuse arete that faces directly east. left of a fun wide crack."},"__v":0},{"_id":"rnBZ6F2AUISyasOPyPbnKw==","name":"LSD Saint","yds":"V11-12","grades":{"yds":"V11-12","font":"8A+","vscale":"V11-12"},"fa":"D.Verderrosa","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.4966,38.6276]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106203523","mp_crag_id":"106203519","climb_id":"rnBZ6F2AUISyasOPyPbnKw==","areaRef":"ay5VhDR0VJSEezh8ERR6CA=="},"content":{"description":"big prow facing east closest to the road.Start on right arete on horizontal crimp for the left hand and right hand on the arete,crux is12ft up then going left to left arete.DO NOT FALL OFF THE TOP OUT!!","protection":"A couple of pads","location":"70ft east of road on the biggest block.."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,65bb3b7b-ed88-5551-93f9-8613d66e828b,6b2e5584-3474-5494-847b-387c11147a08","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","River Road","North Big Bend Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"},{"count":1,"label":"V11-12"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.4966,38.6276]},"bbox":[-109.49717558724424,38.627150339818144,-109.49602441275576,38.62804966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106203519","area_id":"ay5VhDR0VJSEezh8ERR6CA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.49717558724424,38.627150339818144],[-109.49602441275576,38.627150339818144],[-109.49602441275576,38.62804966018187],[-109.49717558724424,38.62804966018187],[-109.49717558724424,38.627150339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:38.928Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:10.946Z"}
