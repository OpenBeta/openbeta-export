It's the long acute corner with the wide crack. It starts off fairly steep but the angle rolls off toward the top. Slings can be spotted on the left face about 120' up.This climb is slightly harder than its neighbor Bloody Elbows. It's a pretty long and sustained pitch. There is some good hand jamming but if your wide crack technique is lacking (like mine), BRING BIG GEAR! Fun route.From the first set of anchors, you can continue about 20' to the ledge at about 5.9+/.10a, protectable by two bolts. Otherwise, rap with 2 ropes or 1x70m rope. Also, make sure to pull the ropes from far out from the wall and far to the left if you don't want to have to cut it after it gets stuck. If you look closely when climbing the route, there is a rope graveyard inside, of many ropes all caught in the same way at the same spot...","protection":"Doubles or triples in the #1 to #4 Camalot range, depending on boldness.
