This route isn't very well documented but still seems to attract a lot of attention. Artist Tears has been hammered on considerably, and the already large pin scars on the route have been growing larger with each year. Regardless, the climb is still magnificent and will hopefully go clean soon.\n\nP1. The first pitch is considered to be the crux. I managed to hook through the pin holes and nutted through most of the remainder of the pitch only love tapping two nuts to reach the belay.\n\nP2. Unfortunately, the second pitch was much harder to maintain a clean accent, and I ended up doing more hamering than I wanted to. With the advent of Splitter Cams, this pitch, and possibly the whole climb, will go completely clean.\n\nP3.\n\nKudos to the party that manages to do so!!! This is one of the sheerest walls out there!\n\nP.S. The descent is a nightmare to find. We never did find the right way down, so I won't put anybody else through that misery and keep our line of descent private.","protection":"Cams, Splitter Cams, fixed bolts, drilled angles.","location":"On the Anasazi Buttress betwen Negro Bill & Short canyons."},"__v":0},{"_id":"dIKquss4Vw684qwEgy1aRQ==","name":"Navajo Route","yds":"5.11-","grades":{"yds":"5.11-","french":"6c"},"fa":"Unknown (FFA : Ray Jardine & Don Peterson '71)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.53608,38.60855]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106361266","mp_crag_id":"105717209","climb_id":"dIKquss4Vw684qwEgy1aRQ==","areaRef":"A4Z0+QWvUtiP1S6xyopf6g=="},"content":{"description":"Good climb on mostly solid rock (esp. for this wall).
