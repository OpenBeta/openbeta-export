Starts off in a hand crack then quickly widens to a short off-width that quickly turns into a small chimney that leads to a roof. Traverse 6-8 ft on good holds and pull the roof to a 3 bolt anchor. Even with a few hours of cleaning the route is still fairly dirty but will clean with future ascents.\n\nIt is possible to toprope the climb by scrambling up the backside at about 5.4 or so and doing a short (10ft?) rappel to the climbs anchors.
