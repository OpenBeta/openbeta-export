Climb up and right along an overhanging bulge (protected by three pins) using incut crimps, clip a bolt, and step left along a horizontal to the arete.  If you found these moves difficult, get ready.  Continue up the face and arete past two more bolts to a good stance immediately below the crux: a really awesome (but reach-dependent?) sequence using two side pulls and (seemingly) no feet.  Clip a fourth bolt, perform a difficult mantle, and then run it out a ways along the arete on scary gear (two yellow Aliens in a flaring slot) and scary holds to more bolts and a great belay ledge.  Many sections of 5.11 on this pitch.\n\nP2\n\n:  Climb up off the belay over ledgey terrain and dicey holds 25' to a bolt.  Repeat this for 3 more bolts (hardest/scariest move comes about ten feet above the fourth bolt) to an anchor on the summit.  Mostly 5.10-.  Descent:  From a second anchor on the far side of the tower you can get down in one clean rap with double 60m ropes and 10' of downclimbing.  You can also stop at the high notch between Dolomite and Big Bend Butte if your ropes are shorter.\n\nDolofright is an incredible route, especially when you consider that Tom Gilje bolted this thing on lead, but Fred Knapp must have been on Crack when he said that it was the best Wingate face climbing he'd ever done.  There are many great, difficult sequences, but they are constantly interrupted by terrifying sections of climbing on flexing holds.  Falls are not necessarily clean on this climb, and I felt that both pitches are deserving of an R rating.  That said, the position (especially on the lower crux pitch) is awesome and the summit is great, but this is definately a route for true desert rats.","protection":"One or possibly two yellow Aliens (or equivalent), one or possibly two #1 Camalots, and a dozen draws/slings.
