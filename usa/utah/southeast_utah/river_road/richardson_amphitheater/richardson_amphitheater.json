Desert Rock claims unknown, but the east face says Brad Bond, Alden Strong, April 1998 (2nd Ascent of Stinger)\n\nP1: The route begins in some rotten mudrock giving it the A2+ grade. 40' of Lost arrows, peckers, stoppers, small cams lead to a small roof where you need a huge topstep to plug in the first good piece. The route becomes C1 from here, with a range of hand size up through a wide 5's and 6's roof (This would probably go free at hard 5.11+?). Pass an intermediate anchor and continue up the bombay chimney (5.9). VG and a 6 was nice to have here. Save a 5 or 6 for the last 10 feet of the pitch.\n\nP2: Scramble up choss directly above the anchor (5.7R) getting in mental pro until reaching the sub-summit. C1 leads to a final mantle on jugs and loose blocks.","protection":"Doubles .1 to 5, 1x 6, VG, small stoppers a few peckers and long lost arrows. webbing. next person should bring a register.","location":"Near the right side of the west face. It is the only feasible line. 1 short rap from the summit and another rap from the top of p1 anchor with a 70m rope. with a 60, you could do 3 raps if you set up the intermediate anchor."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,65bb3b7b-ed88-5551-93f9-8613d66e828b,6de28dea-6cb5-5b63-b8ee-2c89cdf0d3b7","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","River Road","Richardson Amphitheater"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.30467,38.74866]},"bbox":[-109.30524656198014,38.74821033981814,-109.30409343801986,38.74910966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114096183","area_id":"beKN6my1W2O47iyJzfDTtw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:38.927Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:21.253Z"}
