Once you've climbed up to the basin and the base of the tower walk around climbers left to the back of the tower to get to the base of the summit pitch.\n\nPitch one: Climb pretty fun 5.9 hands into the chimney, follow the chimney up getting plenty of gear along the way.The climbing is fairly mellow and the rock is good for the most part. About halfway up pull past some chockstones that are solidly wedged except for one; test them out before you yard on them. Near the top the chimney tightens down and the crack in the back gets wider; it's a bit of a grovel but not as bad as it looks from below. Once out of the chimney walk towards the tower and you'll see an anchor built off a bomber bush which just sounds silly. Belay from here.\n\nPitch two: Walk around to the back of the tower. Climb 5.9 hands and traverse right through loose 5.6 when the crack fades out to reach another crack. Climb 5.8 mostly hands to the summit.","protection":"Desert Rock III called for a triple set but a double set from tips to #5 Camalots should suffice for most parties. 5-6 long runners to keep your rope running smoothly. One 70m rope. Extra webbing for the anchors would probably be a good idea; the anchors were fine when we climbed it but as it'll probably be another decade until someone else gets up there they'll most likely need to be replaced by then.","location":"Getting off: rap pitch 2. walk back to the bush and do another rap from here to the ground. a 60m rope might make it but a 70 will for sure,"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,65bb3b7b-ed88-5551-93f9-8613d66e828b,af13aeb7-98c0-59d1-b636-859b2b2a0550","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","River Road","Podium Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.46721,38.64812]},"bbox":[-109.46778575205173,38.647670339818134,-109.46663424794825,38.64856966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110653396","area_id":"rxOut5jAWdG2NoWbKyoFUA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:38.927Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:21.672Z"}
