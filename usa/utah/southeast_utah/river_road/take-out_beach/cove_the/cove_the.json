Stick clipping the first bolt and a helmet for the belayer a good idea. Climb up a short sandy corner and enter the first boulder problem. Â La Faberge has 3 micro boulder problems and a nice angle. Unfortunately some of the holds on this rig will always be sandy and fragile. This and the two open and uncleaned projects to right were bolted by Sam Lightner Jr. He was nice enough to let me climb on this rig. Like a Faberge egg, pretty from a distance but maybe shouldn't be touched by an untrained handler.","protection":"9 bolts","location":"Farthest left route at \"The Cove\".
