Climb the crack to where the rock becomes soft and loose.  Continue up past this loose band of rock to more solid climbing in a corner where two large cracks converge to create some fantastic geometry.  Optional belay here to reduce rope drag.  Climb the corner where the two cracks come together, either by stemming or using the offwidth crack in back.  Above this, the rock becomes loose and delicate again, so dance cautiously up the next 30 feet to the summit of the pillar.","protection":"Single rack up to BD# 0.75.

USDA prime Wingate the whole way. A rarity, a desert face climb with natural gear. Long approach, but cool route and cool location. Start the climb on the (shorter) west side from an obvious shoulder. Mantel up and left, step right, up a brief dihedral to a ledge. Continue pretty much straight up, passing good but scattered placements in pockets and horizontal cracks. The third large band is the crux. The moves here are harder for those much under five-foot-ten. Once committed, a fall would not be very long, but would probably involve an ankle-biting ledge. Gets easier above here. Nice summit, with great views out over Moab.","protection":"Two sets of cams from 1/2\" to #4 Camalot. One #4.5, and possibly one #5. (#4.5 is especially helpful). No nuts.
