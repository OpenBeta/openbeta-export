The route follows an obvious, natural line and offers engaging climbing on mostly solid rock. There are some loose spots on the third pitch but they're short lived and not too bad. The rest of the route more than makes up for it.\n\nPitch One - Find the obvious right facing dihedral that faces the road and climb it to the top of Purge Pillar. The gear is thin at the start. Belay from two bolts. (5.10+)\n\nPitch Two - Step left and climb the 3.5\" to 4.5\" offwidth past a couple pods. The crack then tapers down to thin hands in a shallow right facing dihedral for a long way. Belay on a ledge with two bolts. (5.11)\n\nPitch Three - Climb over a small roof and continue up corners passing some loose rock along the way. Belay from gear (.75 Camalot and big cams) on a good ledge below a wide crack in a corner. (5.10d)\n\nPitch Four - Layback up the offwidth and around a small roof to find fun and easy climbing all the way to the summit.
