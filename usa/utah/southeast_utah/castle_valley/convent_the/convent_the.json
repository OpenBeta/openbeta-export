It doesn't get the traffic that a lot of the other Castle Valley trade routes get which has pros (no lines, more adventure) and cons (not quite as clean and user friendly).  If you've ticked off the other nearby towers, then you really have no excuse not to climb this route.  It has mostly straightforward meat and potatoes hand crack climbing with a few short but burly cruxes.  There are a few wide sections, too, but they're pretty clean and straightforward.\n\nHeres how it breaks down:\n\nP1 (150', 5.11+):  Traverse from the right into the corner below the huge roof.  Climb the corner  to the roof, get in some gear, and dip into your inner orangutan to bust out the roof.  The moves aren't obvious, but it's obvious that there are no feet and that if the hike up the talus didn't wake you up, this section of climbing will.  After the roof, battle the inevitable rope drag through fun hand cracks and a wide section protected by a #1 camalot crack in the back.  There are a few good ledges to set up a belay (save some hand-sized pieces).\n\nP2(120', 5.11+):  Climb a super clean hand crack that starts at #1 camalots and goes to a #4 or #5 C4 before pinching back down to fingers and thin hands.  Where the crack gets wide, there are lots of pockets and face features to make things easier.  Pull a small roof via some really cool and fun moves (5.11+, but both my buddy Charlie and I thought it was WAY easier than the crux of P1).  Then keep climbing up a crack that eventually turns into a low-angled clean finger crack.  Belay in a recessed area.\n\nP3 (~120', 5.8ish):  Continue up the crack system, which is basically a chimney at this point.  Work your way up through some ledges, and belay when it seems like it's just a scramble to the top.\n\nThen scramble to the top.\n\nDescent:  We rappelled the very large corner system located to the climber's left of the route (2 60m ropes required).  The first rap is from a single good, vertically-drilled bolt on a ledge located between the Value of Audacity and the very large corner.  The second rap has 1 good bolt and a bunch of junk.  The third rap has no good bolts and only junk (Someone needs to back this up.  A bolt would be great.  You might also be able to ditch a #10 hex in the crack here)\n\nNote:  There are no fixed anchors on The Value of Audacity (and with a name like that, it seems like there shouldn't be)","protection":"Doubles on blue tcu to #4 C4.

A few nuts and some long slings, too.","location":"The Value of Audacity is visible from the road leading to Sister Superior from US128.

We (Goldstein, MacDonald) assume we did the first free ascent.  The name is a tip of the hat to Nigel Tufnel, who might say of the route, \"Don't even look at it\".\n\nThe salient feature of the route is a long, right leaning, black slab near the left end of the west face of the Convent;  this slab is clearly visible from the road.Start below the slab, at the base of a chimney blocked by large chockstones about 50' up.  Another identifying feature of the start is bolt about 30' above the ground.\n\nP1: 5.10b, 60'.  Follow fisty crack on sandy rock past bolt and into chimney.  Chimney horizontally below blocks to lip and surmount (crux).  Pro is good, but even with long runners rope drag becomes untenable as soon as the chimney is escaped, forcing a premature belay just short of a comfortable alcove.

There are several pitches on this climb longer than 35 meters, along with an overhanging pitch, so the best decent is Choir Boyz.  If you plan to project it, bring a tag line so you can make it back to the anchors on pitches 3 and 4.\n\nThe climb starts on the looker's right third of the Convent, in the large, right facing dihedral.  You will see a belay bolt next to a small roof.\n\nPitch One (30 M, 5.11) - This pitch was originally a scary lead 'cuz it was full of detached flakes (which was our first inspiration to name it after Buddhism - non-attachment, get it?). Some bolts may seem unnecessary, but they were originally placed on lead due to dreadful gear in sketchy rock.  However, it cleaned up nicely and became an awesome pitch, particularly moving past the âpinnedâ block.  From the belay bolt, mantle up through the choss until you are below the corner (you can use a big cam here then leave it on the ground as the second cleans). Head up and right past a bolt for an exciting 5.10+ face move, or stay left in the shattered corner past a pin for some 5.11 stemming. Gain the primary corner and move up past the bolts until you are below the block.  This block is a bit intimidating, but we pinned it to the main wall with a 3 ft. rod of stainless steel, so it should be bomber.  If the route is not getting much traffic, this block does produce silt, but cleans up nicely with traffic. Use the face holds on the block to move up and right to the anchor.  (Be gentle with the holds because it is not the best sandstone, and underclinging the block is closer to 5.12.)\n\nPitch Two (30 M, 5.10-) â This is a stellar dihedral.  Classic desert climbing, very fun.\n\nPitch Three (37 M, 5.12) â The Buddhaâs Belly! It is not everyday you find a bulging headwall in the desert, so prepare yourself for a wild ride and a unique desert climbing experience!  Head up the crack 15â or so, until it kind of runs out.  Make a moderate but airy move left until you can gain the crack splitting the Buddhaâs Belly.  Move up through the nice hands as it gets steeper.  Now for the business- make your way through the crux with thin hands as the crack cuts right through the face.  Keep your wits about you as the crack heads up again, in fingers and tight hands, and get back above your feet.  Put those blue camalots to use in the upper section through the small roof.  The belay is off to the left, and if you desire you can place a cam high in the crack before leaning left to grab the anchor. You cannot rappel this pitch without a tag line tied to the anchors below, seriously.\n\nPitch Four (40 M, 5.11) â This would be a stellar line in the creek any day, so donât think the fun is over!  Start up the fun, mellow hand crack until it gains the headwall.  Move through fun hands up the steep headwall as the crack gets thinner and thinner.  Enjoy the âzig zags.â And be sure to look around for foot holds outside of the crack.  As the crack fades, delicately move to the left until you are below the right facing corner.  Remember to save some hand sized gear for this upper section.  Gain the ledge and move left to the anchor. This is a 40 M pitch, so keep that in mind if you want to rap it.\n\nPitch Five (25 M, 5.9) â there are some fun moves at the beginning of this pitch, but towards the end move with care through the big blocks.  Move up and left through the horizontal features passing a fixed pin and a bolt.  Then head straight up through the loose blocks until the comfortable belay ledge.\n\nPitch Six (10 M, 5.8) â this is more like a half pitch, and is set back a ways from pitch 5, which makes it difficult to link.  Move up through the 5.8 hand crack until you gain the summit!\n\nDecent â again, the best decent is Choir Boyz on the north end of the convent.  Given the long pitches, and the overhang on the Buddhaâs Belly, it is tricky to rappel, even with a tag line, because you would have to leave it tied on pitch three, making the pitch 4 rappel tricky as it is 40 meters. So, walk north 15 minutes or so, until you gain the highest point on the NORTH end of the Convent. Then, head South (towards Castleton) down the hill for about 50 yds. and look for a cairn below a mushroom roof. From the cairn you will see a distinct ledge and a new and improved rap down Choir Boyz. One 70 gets you down. IMPORTANT - stick to the corner when arriving at last rap station, otherwise it is easy to find yourself swinging in the breeze.","protection":"This climb takes a lot of gear. You have every right to be skeptical, but below is the list of gear we took even when we knew the route well..\n\n1 set stoppers (optional)\n\n1-2 small TCUs to orange\n\n4 ea. #.5, .75, 1 Camelots\n\n5-6 #2 Camalots (yes, as crazy as that sounds)\n\n4-5 #3 Camalots\n\n1 #5 Camalot (optional, protects exposed move off the deck, then left at base)\n\n12-15 quickdraws\n\n1 tagline (optional, but necessary if you plan to project the belly)","location":"This climb is on the looker's right third of the Convent.  It is in the predominant right facing dihedral, providing it wonderful views of the La Sals.  The start is obvious with a plaque and a belay bolt.  You will also be able to see the obvious Buddha's Belly pitch above you."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,4c6f343e-edd5-5456-a294-de337ef04096,f9cd9b6c-ec70-5de1-a49f-79408f7f6316","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Castle Valley","Convent, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":9,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":4,"advanced":5,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":4,"advanced":5,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.41171,38.6769]},"bbox":[-109.41228598348347,38.67645033981814,-109.41113401651653,38.677349660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717107","area_id":"+c2bbOxwXeGkn3lAj39jFg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:45.889Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:41.144Z"}
