Could be free'd around solid 5.12-, or aided up fairly easily. We chose to aid. This leads into an exposed, and really aesthetic right arching 0.75/#1 hand traverse which leads to the rappel anchors. Warning: This route does NOT top out (YET). We ran out of daylight so couldn't put up the last pitch to the top, but it looked like about 40ft of amazing looking off width/chimney moves to gain the summit. Anchors where they are could be rapped with one 60m rope.","protection":"Gear for the optional first belay (Golds and Blues), bolts at the top of the second belay with quicklinks for rappelling. Double rack from 0.2 - 4 should get ya through this thing, You'll want to bring some off width gear, a couple bolts, and a handrail if you're planning on venturing into the unclimbed last 40ft.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,d0459989-74d5-5584-889a-a1dbba824fa4,dafb3026-39ef-5a0d-8f09-697c1c8cef51","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Ken's Lake","Boogaloo Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.41099,38.48287]},"bbox":[-109.41156442960099,38.48242033981814,-109.41041557039902,38.48331966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117630650","area_id":"2vswJjnvWg2PCWl8HIzvUQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.41156442960099,38.48242033981814],[-109.41041557039902,38.48242033981814],[-109.41041557039902,38.48331966018187],[-109.41156442960099,38.48331966018187],[-109.41156442960099,38.48242033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.939Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:04.779Z"}
