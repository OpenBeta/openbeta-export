Use that to get past the overhang then grab a handle above but grab it *lightly* because it’s weak.\n\nTwo solid bolts are on top and must be extended quite far with webbing, cordelette, or a static line.

A very edgy crimpey climb will make your fingers sore, but you can use the arete on the left to help. Feels a lot like a really fun highball bouldering problem, but would need several crash pads because of uneven ground. Protected with great bolts for the anchor and another for the directional, although the anchor bolts are spaced a little weirdly so probably use something like a sliding X to equalize. Also ideal to use some cordelette to throw the anchor over the edge, friction is otherwise bad really quick on the pretty chossy top edge.","protection":"2 bolts at top, 1 directional bolt","location":"See the main photo of the area, it’s marked.

The same way you would go if you were to set up top ropes for the routes near hop on the bus Gus. It’ll be to the right once you get on top. Look for a large pillar, its not separated. The route will be to the left side of the pillar. To set up a top rope you will need to continue scrambling to the left of the climb. Once on top get above the route.
