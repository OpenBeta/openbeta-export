Partially up the pot-holes you will find a undercling with strange looking and smelling shit on the roof, stick your hand in it anyways because it is one of the few solid holds remaining. Continue to the crack while smearing the feces in your chalk bag. Reaching the crux at the top, pull on a small crimp that you inevitably break off screwing over your second. Top out questing the decision that lead to this excursion.","protection":"no anchor. top rope with a large sling on a horn.
