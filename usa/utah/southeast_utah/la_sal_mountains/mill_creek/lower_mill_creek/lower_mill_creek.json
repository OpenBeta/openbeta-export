Because of this, Gilje's reputation, and probably a fair bit of exaggeration, I had heard that it quite possibly hadn't received a second ascent.  Certainly there are plenty of climbers capable of walking up to this thing and onsighting it, but given that I'm a pretty big chicken, I spent a day on it TR solo before my ascent on lead.\n\nSurprisingly, given the name, the route has ten bolts... but if you don't bring a few finger- and hand-size pieces, you're going to be hating life.  Even so, there is potential to sprain an ankle here or there, but overall the route is quite safe.  Kudos  to Gilje for his vision and impeccable style in establishing this amazing pitch.\n\nThe Trad Warrior climbs up a gently overhanging panel of orange water-streaked rock and is rather isolated from the other main Mill Creek areas.  Access is from above: fix a line to rap down to a spacious belay ledge two hundred feet off the canyon floor, and take a lead line with you.  Climb up fairly easy rock to a first crux move stepping left.  Good rests lead up to a second crux sequence above a short hand crack.  Above this is another marginal rest, followed by a deceptive traverse left, a good shake, and a techy crux sequence up a beautiful black seam.  This is followed by another good rest and finally some rad bear-hugging to the top-out on the rim.\n\nThis is a great route but may need some brushing as it doesn't see much traffic.  Gilje didn't rate it, and no moves are probably harder than V4/5, but I thought overall it was a tad harder redpoint than The Wasp in RMNP, but with a similar tech style, so I'll call it 12+ here and give Tom Gilje, whose routes I enjoy, a big \"thank you\" for his many climbing treasures.","protection":"Ten bolts.

This other line, dubbed \"The Right Hand of Evil,\" had been cleaned and bolted by Mark Howe in 2004, but had seen little action. Supposedly it had been top-roped cleanly by Zach Smith, but had yet to see a clean lead. I myself toproped it several times over the years but usually felt like it was way out of my league. Then, feeling stronger, I called Mark and asked him about it, and he graciously encouraged me to get out there and climb on it.\n\nFind the Front Porch and ID the route. Fix a line and rap in from the next set of anchors down-canyon, atop Axis Of Evil. Climb 20' up off the belay ledge to the first clip (long sling recommended) which protects an initial boulder problem reaching around an arete and into a corner. From here, follow the corner upwards to a layback flake that leads to a good stance below a small roof and a seam above. Figure out how to use this feature to stretch left -- perhaps the true crux of the route -- to the edge of a sharp flake. After this move, continue bear-hugging and liebacking up the edge of the flake and the arete to the right, performing either big, dynamic moves between good holds, or technical moves off of smaller ones. From here the climbing momentarily eases and you climb up and into a V-shaped inset that provides a comfortable no-hands rest. At this point Axis Of Evil breaks left out of the inset, and The Paper Crane traverses right. Take a deep breath and execute some devilishly technical moves traversing right, and slightly down, from the inset to an exposed, pumpy stance below a 10' vertical crack. Some long moves off of decent edges lead up to the crack, and then a technical double gaston gains the right end of a sloping rail and a chance to get a shake and perhaps make the next clip. The final crux comes as a sequential, pumpy fingertip traverse back left over a steep wall with little for feet, followed by a wonderful stand-up move to a stance that would afford a rest if you weren't feeling like you were going to barn-door at any moment. A deep breath, one more clip, and some powerful liebacking and jamming leads up the final 15' section to a bolted anchor by the tree. This last stretch is protectable with a #3 Camalot, but if you made it this far you have nothing to worry about.\n\nThis truly is one of the best climbs I've ever been on: multiple cruxes, amazing, technical movement and all played out upon a beautiful feature in a breathtaking canyon. If you choose to climb this route, please take care of this beautiful area and treat it with respect - it is a magical place.","protection":"15 draws, a long sling.
