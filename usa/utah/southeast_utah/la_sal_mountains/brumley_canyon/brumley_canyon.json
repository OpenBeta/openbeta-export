It starts with hand stack burly move into a ~10 foot wide roof crack of 4\" to 8\". Pull around the lip and continue up more wide crack (crux) for a few moves before gaining the head wall and somewhat easier technical climbing above. There is no anchor. Build an anchor at the boulder.","protection":"Double set from .4 to #5 camalot (or one #5 and one #6) and a few medium nuts. A handful of quickdraws,","location":"Once into Brumley Canyon you'll locate this obvious line as the wide crask that splits a wide pillar. To access the climb choose a path of least resistance down to the creek and back up the other side, bushwacking a fair bit. The start of the climb is at an obvious rock shelf/ledge. Shimmy up on top of the ledge and you'll be able to see the wide crack start just above your head."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,45adc1df-cded-5515-9d81-6818343b6de1,9de687d6-456f-5497-8dc7-1f92399e8cff","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","La Sal Mountains","Brumley Canyon"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.32432,38.47381]},"bbox":[-109.32489435740997,38.47336033981814,-109.32374564259007,38.474259660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119916349","area_id":"neaH1kVvVJeNxx+SOZ6M/w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.939Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:36.178Z"}
