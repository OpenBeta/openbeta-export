Walk left about 10 feet to the crack with pins.  Follow this up 10 feet until it traverses right to another pin, then pull over the top onto a very loose summit.\n\nThis is a good route if you are really bored, looking for an easy tower to solo, or if you just want an introduction to desert rock.\n\nOn an interesting note. You will see two bolts with hangers on the opposing wall from the tower along with two bolts without hangers on the tower.  According to Desert Rock III, a tyrolean traverse was set up here for a commercial.  Seems like it was probably a lame commercial.","protection":"A couple of cams for the crack, some small nuts and/or cheater stick, and some quickdraws.  There are about 5 fixed pins on the route.","location":"Walk up into the saddle on the side of the formation hidden from the road, the route is obvious (look for pins.)"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9524b1b2-900d-507f-b031-461876a90a28,e1b014e6-a919-50bc-8f89-aa9c37ebe347","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Kane Springs Canyon","Pensive Putterman"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.3"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.60303,38.48218]},"bbox":[-109.60360442410185,38.481730339818135,-109.60245557589815,38.482629660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105873542","area_id":"4bAU5qkZULyPiaqcN+vjRw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.60360442410185,38.481730339818135],[-109.60245557589815,38.481730339818135],[-109.60245557589815,38.482629660181864],[-109.60360442410185,38.482629660181864],[-109.60360442410185,38.481730339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.924Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:04.474Z"}
