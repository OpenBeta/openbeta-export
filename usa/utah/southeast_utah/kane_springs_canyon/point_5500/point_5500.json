Keep in mind that the climbing is minimal with a long hot approach. Despite the lack of climbing, the views are outstanding from the airy summit, and in my opinion, worth the long hike.\n\nFrom the 8 foot dryfall, make an interesting mantle and then scramble/route-find northeast through a sandstone fin to the start of the route. The route begins up an angling thin crack into slab. Climb the slab which is protected by 3 bolts and a Lost Arrow and belay from a two bolt anchor. Continue route finding up through a slot section to an apex in the slot and a single belay bolt. The lower section of the slot can be bypassed with some route finding.\n\nTraverse down and left across some slab (2 bolts) to a crack. Then follow the crack for a short distance to the summit plateau; scramble up to the airy summit. Rappel back north from a 3 bolt anchor (1 bolt; (wedge or redhead sleeve?) was loose and should be upgraded to a proper 5 piece sleeve bolt or glue-in).","protection":"Draws and a supplemental single rack for anchors or second pitch protection","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9524b1b2-900d-507f-b031-461876a90a28,65443eb8-f2aa-54b4-bc81-bf6d7c1ce643","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Kane Springs Canyon","Point 5,500"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.62651,38.49629]},"bbox":[-109.6270845365927,38.49584033981814,-109.6259354634073,38.49673966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117817674","area_id":"ZUQ+uPKqVLS8gb9tfBzmQw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.924Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:35.457Z"}
