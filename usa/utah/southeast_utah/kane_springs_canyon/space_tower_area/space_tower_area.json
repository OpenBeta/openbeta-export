It is on Space Tower, which is separated from the main cliff by a large chimney that faces NE.  The tower appears to touch the canyon wall at the top (it is actually separated by about an inch).\n\nHallow Souls involves wild full body stemming inside the chimney.  Begin by climbing 40 feet of easy choss to gain the clean crack system inside the chimney, on the main cliff.  One can belay just inside the chimney, or at a wonderful little ledge about 1/2 way up, or do the whole tower in one rope-stretching pitch (not recommended--there would be lots of rope drag and the top is somewhat run-out).\n\nNear the top the rock becomes soft and brittle and the crack dies out.  Chimney out to the right to a good bolt, and continue until you can pull onto the tower side; a short hand crack leads to fixed anchors.  This top section is scary--the position is phenomenal!  Give yourself a long leash, tag the summit, and then make rap 50 meters to the ground.","protection":"Bring two sets of friends from 0.5 to 3, a set of tcus, and a few medium stoppers.
