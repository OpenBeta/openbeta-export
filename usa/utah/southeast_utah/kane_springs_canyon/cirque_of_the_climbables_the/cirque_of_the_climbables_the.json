It is a super aesthetic climb (esp. P3) and has some great exposure. It can be a little noisy when all the jeeps and dirt bikes are crusin' around. This route has gone free, and there is a lot of chalk up there.\n\nPitch 1 (5.7 or 5.10d): Two ways to go. A goofy 5.7 chimney pitch starts far to the climbers left of the P1 anchor. Begin up a sandy slot, a couple very easy stem moves puts you on a ledge, traverse a few feet right and climb up the 5.7 crack/slot to a ledge, passing a drilled angle. Once on the ledge, walk/scramble to your right for a long way, it's kinda funky. Watch for loose rocks, I almost killed my dog on this pitch. Rope drag can suck. All of this can be avoided by a 5.10d direct start, which begins directly below the pitch one anchors.\n\nPitch 2 (C2): Easy traverse up and right to the crack. Begin with C1,pass some bolt holes for an old anchor after about 60 feet and continue up steep C2 to a three bolt sling belay below a tiny roof. Airy belay spot.\n\nPitch 3(C2): Begin up the beautiful,airy,thin right facing diherdral. At the top of the corner,the crack goes from really thin to wide. Continue up the wide crack to a bolted belay.\n\nPitch 4 (C2):Follow and open book to the top, steep.","protection":"Standard clean aid rack w/ extra small gear, and a #4 camalot or two.","location":"Route climbs the center tombstone.

Stairway to heaven.  a.k.a. Jimmy's Chimney\n\nAn epic will ensue.  The first pitch can be climbed on the left or right side of a bulge in the cliff.  We climbed the right side b/c you approach that side first on the trail, but i would recommend climbing the left side.  We rapped the left side and the rock looked better.  Either way the first pitch is 5.9 to easy 5.10 and not the reason you are there. The second pitch follows the left side of the bulge up a great left facing corner (5.10) with a finger crack that fades away.  Make an exciting exit move from the corner to the face on the right.  Finish the pitch on some fun face climbing (also 5.10). Two pins for pro along the way (small stuff needed for the corner). I believe we linked this and the next easy pitch (5.7) to a small alcove below the beckoning chimney.  Let the work begin.  From here you look up into a bombay chimney.  You can get gear in the first 50' but after that it's 100' of (5.11) squirming.  It took me 3 hours to lead the the 150' chimney pitch - I think i cried a little.
