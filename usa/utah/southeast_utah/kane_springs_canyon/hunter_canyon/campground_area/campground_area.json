First pitch looks good (10-?) and goes up about 40 ft to 2 obvious bolts, second pitch looks chossier and passes a bolt or 2 higher up and leads to the big ledge at the base of the Navajo Arete route. An easier and less chossy approach is to walk back north up the road for +/- 100 yards towards Moab and look for an easy route up to a big ledge that you can use to traverse back right. One bolt up a 5.4 slab (at 38°30'38.75\"N, 109°35'46.10\"W) gets you to the ledge where you can walk/scramble back to the right and up to the base of the Navajo Arete route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9524b1b2-900d-507f-b031-461876a90a28,023d4af9-31da-5f0b-a5f7-d1591cf7f7f8,2ff16633-9c01-5a9a-8c2b-86500b685075","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Kane Springs Canyon","Hunter Canyon","Campground Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.59691,38.50989]},"bbox":[-109.59748464509234,38.509440339818134,-109.59633535490765,38.51033966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116171044","area_id":"L/FmM5wBWpqMK4ZQC2hQdQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.939Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:35.722Z"}
