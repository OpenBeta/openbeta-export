Climb the C1 or 5.11 thin crack to hands (5.9), then fist and offwidth (5.9) to a nice ledge and belay. Take two fat ropes for this pitch to be safe. Use one for the climb through the pendulum, then the other after the pendulum.\n\nPitch 3: Climb C1 past a couple of drilled baby angle holes, a couple of 5.7 moves brings you to the summit.\n\nDescent: One full rope length rappel to the east from two drilled anchors.","protection":"Standard desert rack with extra very small and very large gear. A selection of knifeblades and angles up to 5/8\" or equivalent clean gear.","location":"Moonlight is located in Jackson Hole, south of the Amasa Back. This is southwest of Moab a few miles as the birds see it. Jackson hole is a Rincon, and Moonlight is hidden on the east side of the island of rock in the middle of the Rincon. You can take a tube, canoe or raft and float across from the Potash mine (this is the shortest approach), or hike there via one of two ways. You can also drive there (high clearance only!) by taking Kane Springs Valley Road to Hurrah Pass. Descend the other side of the pass and turn right (west) at the first drivable drainage (near river level). Go down the wash about 1/2 a mile (.8km), then turn right (north) and follow a (faint at first) two-track which crosses another drainage before heading northeast for awhile then gradually turns back to the west. It then veers north and begins the descent into Jackson Hole where a loop goes around the Rincon."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9524b1b2-900d-507f-b031-461876a90a28,d7a49e3d-b7ef-5ae2-b418-daac93407cb1","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Kane Springs Canyon","Jackson Hole"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.542,38.5632]},"bbox":[-109.54257507110296,38.56275033981813,-109.54142492889703,38.56364966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106533103","area_id":"16SePbfvWuK0GNqsk0B8sQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.54257507110296,38.56275033981813],[-109.54142492889703,38.56275033981813],[-109.54142492889703,38.56364966018186],[-109.54257507110296,38.56364966018186],[-109.54257507110296,38.56275033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.925Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:04.571Z"}
