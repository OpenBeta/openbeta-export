From the north-northwest side of the formation, located a large chimney. Climb a hand crack (5.7) to get into the chimney (3rd-4th class) and belay at the top of an apex (~90 feet). Down-climb from the apex to the eastern side of the chimney which is at this point a wide corridor.\n\nLocate the obvious crack on the south side of the corridor and climb it. The crack climbs better than it appears. Use flared hand jams along with huecos and pockets to reach the top (5.10, 75 feet). Belay off hand sized cams. From the top of the second pitch scramble south to the summit.\n\nTo descend, use a bolted anchor off a ledge west of the crack at the top of pitch 2 to rappel back into the corridor. Then either down-climb or use a single pin anchor to rappel out of the chimney.","protection":"BD C4 #0.3-5 and nuts.
