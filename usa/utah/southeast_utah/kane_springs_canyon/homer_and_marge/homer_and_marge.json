It is another very easy tower.\n\nThe route starts on the north side shoulder.  Climb a ten foot, 6 inch wide crack up to a ledge, walk over to a (quarter inch bolt) bolt ladder.  A few of the bolts are missing hangers so some rivet hangers or tie offs make this easier, but some wire nuts would probably work too.  Climb about 5 bolts through some dirty rock onto a 5.5 ridge that takes you to the top.","protection":"A large cam for the 6 inch crack helps, but is not necessary.  If you can't do this bouldery move, a shoulder stand would probably suffice.  Bring some nuts or rivet hangers to sling the hangerless bolts, and quickdraws.","location":"North side of the formation.  The bolt ladder is easily visible."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9524b1b2-900d-507f-b031-461876a90a28,2bb84871-dbea-580c-b24e-aae4131d80c5","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Kane Springs Canyon","Homer and Marge"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.6024,38.5232]},"bbox":[-109.60297475134944,38.522750339818145,-109.60182524865057,38.52364966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105873566","area_id":"K7hIcdvqWAyyTqrkEx2AxQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.926Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:36.033Z"}
