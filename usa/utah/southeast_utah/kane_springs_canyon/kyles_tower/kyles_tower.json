Climb up about 15 feet, then traverse right to another crack that is slightly lower in angle. Climb past a large flake in the crack that will eventually come out and kill someone. Move up over the ledge, then into the chimney that is the mirror of the Beyer Route on the south face.  Proceed up this, groveling and pushing, till you reach the summit. There is a good anchor here.\n\nMost of this route is too wide to get pro, but too thin to get in.... and there is loose rock... Yeah, why did I do it!\n\nThe start doesn't look it, but it's 5.10. Just after the ledge it's 5.10 as well, but at least there you can get in one piece of hand-sized gear.\n\nBTW, for all I know this was the FA route of the tower done by some offwidth master from the '60s, but I saw no sign of it. Let me know if so.","protection":"Not much. You are either chimneying or offwidthing, so it's really wide. I did get a hand-sized piece in the upper chimney, and a .75 Friend fits in behind the \"1950 DA\" flake (Google that if you don't know about 1950 DA). Other than that, you could bring a few of those really, really, big chimney-size Big Bros, but that's about it.","location":"This is the corner on the west face of the tower.
