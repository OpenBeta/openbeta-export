'Day of the Eagle' seems to be the most aesthetic option.  You can also hike up the canyon to the left of 'Day of the Eagle' and avoid a pitch one all together.  Whatever you end up doing the goal is to get to the crack off the bench on the north side of the tower. Once on the bench, bolts should be visible high on the tower.\n\nPitch 2:\n\nStep across a 3' wide 30' deep chimney to access the crack. Climb this crack up and left past some broken sections. Make and awkward move up and right to access a big sloping ledge.  Traverse the ledge right to more crack and bolts above.\n\nDescent:\n\nOne double rope rappel puts you on the ground.","protection":"This list of pro is for the summit pitch only as there are multiple ways to approach the base of this pitch.\n\nStoppers\n\nOffsets\n\nDouble set of cams from black alien to #1 camalot\n\nOne #2 and #3 camalot\n\nAssortment of pins including baby angles, lost arrows, peakers, and blades.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,d5c068ea-7baa-5216-b63b-378d14dc92b1,e8b38afb-c4d7-5c99-822a-1123c951aadd","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Sunshine Wall","Dickfour"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.72161,38.85123]},"bbox":[-109.72218739244802,38.850780339818144,-109.72103260755198,38.851679660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108535927","area_id":"6LOK+8TXXJmCKhEjyVGq3Q=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:40.165Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:39.213Z"}
