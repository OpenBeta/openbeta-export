Continue past another fixed pin to a beautiful clean crack that arcs around forming the \"C-Dunt Traverse\". At the end of the arc, turn a couple roof/corners on big gear. The second of these roofs is wide, awkward and very strenuous, even if you're aiding... which you will be.  Continue to the notch and a two-bolt anchor. (5.9, A1, C1+)\n\nPitch 2 - Begin up a crack a few feet to the left of the anchor and gain a small shelf. From here the original party nailed up a thin and soft crack to a flaring, horizontal ledge/crack and then placed a bolt on the bulging wall above. (After I placed five crappy pieces in the shelf at my feet and spent 15 minutes looking at my options for leaving the shelf, I proudly called for the 10 foot stick clip.) Pass a blown out bat hook hole and from the highest bolt, tension traverse right to the anchor. (C1+ with a stick clip, originally rated A2 though it seemed harder)\n\nPitch 3 - Climb the soft crack above the anchor on pins and cams passing some fixed pieces along the way. Save some small pins and a little mojo for the final moves onto the summit. (A2)","protection":"Two sets of cams up to 4 Camalot with an extra .5 and .75.\n\nOne #5 and #6 Camalot\n\nA decent selection of pitons less than 1\".\n\nA couple rivet hangers.\n\nStick Clip?
