Scramble atop a detached block and venture through some rotten rock towards the double finger cracks and obvious hand crack. Follow the crack through a hanging chimney and some sandy wide sections to a stellar left leaning hand crack above that goes from #3's to #2's at the end and a two bolt anchor.\n\nThe second offwidth/chimney section has some loose blocks that may need to be cleaned. This is a very sandy route and has a fair amount of loose rock, so take care, bring a big rack, and check this thing out, it's wild!","protection":"Double rack, and as many #3's you can find. (I placed 6) I also placed everything from a #00 Mastercam to a #6 C4.

The rock above and a bit to the right of the piton seems to be the best way to go. You can get a #3 Camalot in to the right above a little ledge. Once in the dihedral you can place one more #3, then it is #2's for the next 70'. about 20' from the top the crack narrow's a little to #1's, and then .75's just before the anchors. There are some features on the wall to give your feet a break. This is an awesome crack, but to this point it does not look like it has seen much traffic. It could still use some cleaning up.","protection":"Quick draw for the piton.
