This is perhaps the best of the slab routes established here by Mike Baker and his friends, (if only because of the name).This is the rightmost of the face routes, on this nice slab. They get harder as you move left to right, as the slab curves into a steeper configuration further right. The rock is better as the angle steepens up too, so this climb is mostly on great varnished Wingate, rather than the pale gritty fleshy stuff the easier routes waddle up.The pitch starts with thin moves to climb straight up to the first bolt. Or sidle across from the left to avoid this bit.The climbing is superb, linking crispy edges, on beautiful rippled stone, with a variety of mantels and high steps. The moves at the third (?) bolt are not easy. You smear right and clamber up onto a (not very) rounded protuberance. If you are real confident on thin smeary face, you'll have no trouble, but more slab-challenged folks (like myself) will struggle to get established on the lump, from where the next bolt becomes clippable. Above this a ridiculously tenuous smear move on perfect black Wingate, luckily with a bolt in front of your face. There is an odd finger/toe-pocket hereabouts. Not very natural-looking, in just the right place to step up into. Maybe this was going to be a bolt-hole. It's not entirely necessary. Grunt right here to a big foot-ledge. Relax. Step left and up onto more sandy ripply territory and much more generic climbing, with ever bigger scallops.

However, the approach is a nice hike, with great views, the glade/meadow where this feature is located is a very cute little spot, and the feature itself is a ridiculous shape; a penguin with a blindfold. Maybe it's a labrador puppy. it's very friendly anyway.Approach by hiking up a ledge/stratum from your car. Up and up and up, until you summit the highest point of the ridge. Then contour down (north) and around to enter the penguin's garden.The route begins up a short crack. This is allegedly 5.5, in Bjornstad's book. Hmmmm. You can avoid this by a runout face bit to the right; much more pleasant. I chose the wide crack, and struggled. The final short face is steep, ledgy and fun.
