Adventure climbing!  Drive up the road farther than seems necessary and park just before a section of the road that is bulldozer scraped slickrock.  Stay high  (east) on the approach or else you might find yourself hiking extra to find your way to the base of the tower.\n\nThe photo existing on this site shows the easy slab  approach to the very base of the route on the North  West side of the tower.  It would be a good idea to protect the belay if you start right here.\n\nMy partner led off without feeling confident in much of the initial gear, but eventually got something decent in.  After moving through the worse rock at the bottom, my partner placed a more trustworthy cam and continued to climb to a section of the tower that you can stick your arm through.   No joke, you could grab a climber's arm on the route on the south side of the tower.\n\nThe top out is a bit awkward.  Make some interesting  moves under the roof of the \"hammer-head\" to clip a  bolt on the lip.  Commit yourself to the very do-able moves over the lip and on to the summit.\n\nThe day we topped out, the slings on top were quite old, but since this tower seems to be seeing more ascents in the new millennium, I'm sure the webbing you find will be quite worthy for rappel.\n\nSounds like a single 60m rappel is working for people.","protection":"One set of cams, stoppers, and long slings.  Sounds like chain anchors on top now.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"vUgibPikUFGHsrs0RvxDQA==","name":"Black Elvis","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Glenn Dunmire Solo April '91","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.542,38.5632]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"112888457","mp_crag_id":"105716898","climb_id":"vUgibPikUFGHsrs0RvxDQA==","areaRef":"deIyQWeXVyqlxw29dvv2oQ=="},"content":{"description":"This climb is located across from the Rhino horn on the South side of Elvis's Hammer.
