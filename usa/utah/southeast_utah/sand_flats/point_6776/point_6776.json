Begin scrambling up the narrow north ridge of 6,776 (class 3) to a wide bench before a steep headwall. Locate a slab with a crack near the right side of the headwall. Climb up this crack/slab for 30 feet to easier terrain (5.6). Be careful of some soft sandstone through this section but luckily the gear is good. Continue through a maze of large blocks, with a short awkward mantle in the middle of the maze, to the true summit (class 4).\n\nWe did not place the 3 “bolt” anchor. Bring fresh webbing and rappel 45’ back to the bench. It should be noted that the “bolts” are Hilti screws and should be upgraded to proper 5 piece sleeve bolts.","protection":"Finger sized pieces and maybe a BD C4 #5 for a starting piece.","location":"Begin up the north side of the formation."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,04a5cd61-1d00-557b-bcd0-0ae4f3c4b6af,3b76407f-2738-508b-8d01-bf39ee81c06c","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Sand Flats","Point 6,776"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.39553,38.57204]},"bbox":[-109.39610514185433,38.57159033981814,-109.39495485814565,38.572489660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115428118","area_id":"O3ZAfyc4UIuNAb857oHAbA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.39610514185433,38.57159033981814],[-109.39495485814565,38.57159033981814],[-109.39495485814565,38.572489660181866],[-109.39610514185433,38.572489660181866],[-109.39610514185433,38.57159033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:39.431Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:49.762Z"}
