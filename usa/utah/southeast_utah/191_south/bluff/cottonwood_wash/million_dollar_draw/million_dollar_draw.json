I am sure the first pitch could be done on the north side as well but looks harder.  The first pitch is a 5.5 chimney, with not a ton of pro but pretty easy, about 40 ft.  I have seen people free solo the first part.  Natural belay on a large ledge.  Second pitch is the fun stuff that is mostly hands and wide hands up a slanting right strait-in crack for 160 ft.  Belay from the top on a good ledge with a great view.  The belay/rap ledge is north facing and kinda cold in the winter.","protection":"BD camalots:  2+3 triples, a couple 4s, and a 5 could work up top.  I haven't climbed it in a while but I think a single set of smaller stuff like TCUs will more than work.  Belay and rap from the top on 2 fixed pins with webbing.  Double 60m ropes.","location":"From the gate walk down the road for about a mile, almost parrallel with The Bant, head west into a side canyon.  There is a climb or two on your right as you head west into the side drainage.  Not far in you will begin to see a tall detached spire with the right leaning crack on the wall behind it.  The climb is moslty east facing."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,03236b20-a57a-585a-99a4-d97dcfe15d08,0928a6b8-83ff-5ad6-9d17-6d5c5974a34b,51e62eea-82a1-5751-8844-e7cb285673c2,1e7cae8b-7006-5bdc-9d79-0d13617ee3ad","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","191 South","Bluff","Cottonwood Wash","Million Dollar Draw"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.57053,37.3032]},"bbox":[-109.57109529768215,37.30275033981813,-109.56996470231785,37.30364966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109348829","area_id":"Hnyui3AGW9ydeQ0TYX7jrQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.57109529768215,37.30275033981813],[-109.56996470231785,37.30275033981813],[-109.56996470231785,37.30364966018187],[-109.57109529768215,37.30364966018187],[-109.57109529768215,37.30275033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:58.313Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:19.325Z"}
