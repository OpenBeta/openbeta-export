Climb the very soft slab to a stance. Go up the soft corner to the traverse, then up the headwall to a bolted anchor.\n\nThe route is extremely soft. The pins I placed were often removed by hand. The only time I felt a fall would be caught was when two pieces were placed together and equalized.","protection":"I took a few peckers, a couple of L.A types, and a host of angles up to 3/4. As I tried toplace double friends where ever I could get in one, I recomend at least a double set from .5 to 3.
