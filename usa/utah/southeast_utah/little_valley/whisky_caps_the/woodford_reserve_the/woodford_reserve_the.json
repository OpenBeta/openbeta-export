The crux is high and requires some Peckers. 80 feet.\n\nP2 free clmb the corner with loose rock but really fun climbing. At the ledge slip back into the aiders and pull on a bolt, then a few aid moves, then two more bolts to get past the giant detached flake. A few more  Lost Arrow placements and you hit the roof. Climb over it and follow the crack on mid size cams. Its probably possible to climb the corner, but its mankier rock. Eventually pull out of the aiders and free climb (5.9) the wider crack on soft holds. Pull over the lip and clip the anchor. The pitch is a rope stretcher, like 190 feet.\n\nRap the routeÂ… watch the ends.","protection":"I had 4 X everything to friends 3.5 and wanted more in the small to mid.
