Go about 160 feet to a really nasty loose block clip a bolt to get around it then climb up the alcove and onto the slab to the anchor out right.\n\nP2 climb through a chimney then onto a big slab. IT steepens as you go higher. Clip two bolts to get to the summit chimney. Take one set of friends from 2-6.\n\nRap the route","protection":"3 sets  friends #1-4 with extra #1s and #1.5s.
