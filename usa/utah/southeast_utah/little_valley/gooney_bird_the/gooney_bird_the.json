Its the northwest face. For some reason this route gets no stars in Bjornstads DRII... I belive it deserves at least a couple as the climbing is interesting. The rock on the last pitch is unique... pockets and edges.\n\nP1. Climb a slab to a pod, then follow a tight crack, mostly fingers, for about 100 feet to a ledge and two bolts. 5.10 with some dirty slab moves up high. Mostly thin gear and hands\n\nP2. Go up through the wide crack in the bulge using fingers, hands, and the odd chimney move... it looks wider than it climbs. The crack lessens in angle, then goes right to a ledge with some funky face moves. Mostly hands size pieces. 5.10+\n\nP3. You might want to break this short pitch into two as it circles the Birds head. Go up on good horizontals to a bolt. Make some face moves on decent rock to a ledge, then follow that right to the back of the birds head. Its on this ledge that you might want set up a belay because of rope drag. You will need wide stuff. Follow the ledge around to the back of the head and climb (little spicey) on pockets and edges to the summit. Get gear in the pockets (it might hold). The pitch is 5.10-.\n\nRap from the summit  to the top of 2, then from there to the ground with 2 60's. The summit anchor leaves a bit to be desired. A nice 1/2 inch bolt and some chain would do wonders for it (I can provide this to you).","protection":"Triples from small alien to hand size, then doubles for fist, then a few large pieces for the top and the odd pod (and bulge). You need slings and extra biners, too.","location":"On the Gemini Bridges Road where it goes from the Little Valley to Arths Pasture. The hike is not very demanding... I used my bumper as my bottom anchor."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,578a4a44-34bf-58ed-8250-9d00c38bf6c3,fc5b666a-9083-5f22-b83e-406ef681168d","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Little Valley","Gooney Bird, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.67293,38.60781]},"bbox":[-109.67350542845901,38.60736033981814,-109.67235457154096,38.608259660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105934139","area_id":"/FtmapCDXyK4PkBu9oEWjQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.67350542845901,38.60736033981814],[-109.67235457154096,38.60736033981814],[-109.67235457154096,38.608259660181865],[-109.67350542845901,38.608259660181865],[-109.67350542845901,38.60736033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:48.513Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:26.467Z"}
