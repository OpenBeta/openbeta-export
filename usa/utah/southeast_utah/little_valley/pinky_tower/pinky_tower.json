Belay from gear in the notch. (5.10)  Note- It is also possible to gain the notch from back side with 4th class scrambling.\n\nPitch 2  This is the money pitch. Carefully work your way out to the first bolt on the corner of the tower. You can get some manky gear at your feet but its best not to fall before the first bolt. Continue working up and around the tower on superb face climbing protected by bolts. When you get to the opposite corner of the tower follow a rising crack that leads to a vertical fistcrack and the summit. Watch for rope drag on this pitch. (5.10)\n\n1 two rope rappel from bolts on the summit to the ground on the back side of the tower. (It is possible to rap this with one 60 meter rope though you may have to downclimb a little of the 4th class approach.)","protection":"Two sets of cams from yellow Alien to #4 Camalot.
