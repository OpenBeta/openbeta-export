There are only two short places near the entrance that are a bit tricky depending on the amount of water in the stream.From the campsite hike abot 20 mins then walk steeply out of wash to right side of tower to a large pine below a big chimney.  From here scramble left for 60' along a sloping ledge to the start of the route.  Bolt belay.\n\nP1. Two bolts and a pin(in place) lead out of a V niche and over a roof, two more bolts then a bit of a run out to a bulge where cracks begin, which are followed to the anchors. 80' 5.8+ C2\n\nP2. Steep cracks and grooves to an anchor in an open chimney.  120' 5.9 C1\n\nP3. Up chimney to big ledge. 100' 5.9\n\nP4. Two bolts to reach a crack and chimney system that cuts through the formidable final 350' of the tower.  After a short soft crack section the rock improves.  100' 5.9 C2\n\nP5. Follow widening cracks and grooves in good rock to where the chimney cuts through to the other side of the tower.  150' 5.10 C1\n\nP6. Wriggle through the narrow chimney to single bolt belay at the start of the last chimney pitch of the 1987 Toula route.  Follow this really nice pitch to large ledge just below the summit.  150' 5.8+\n\nP7. A couple of boulder problem moves and then easy slab to the top.  30'\n\nThis route may go all free, pitches 1 and 4 being the main problem.\n\nOne can descend by the original descent, or after the second rap new anchors on the edge leads to a big ledge(rap bolts on the far edge)at the top of pitch 3 East Face.
