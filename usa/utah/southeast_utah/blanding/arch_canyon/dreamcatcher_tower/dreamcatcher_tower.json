For reasons such as weather, time, gear problems, etc. the ascent took three attempts over a period of a year.  On the first two Andy Ross led the first and third pitch, Paul Ross the second, and then with great support from Mr Cam Burns, Ross eventually led the long awaited final pitch to the summit.  Starts just right of a massive chimney up a short slab to enter the crack system.There are two ways to approach the tower from the rim or the four wheel drive up the canyon.\n\nP1).  Up the slab past two bolts, then follow the crack free and aid to double anchors. 130', 5.9 C2.\n\nP2).  Slightly overhanging thin cracks with intermittent bolts to double anchors. 70', 5.8 C2.\n\nP3).  Climb the overhanging thin crack for 25', and then the angle eases up a wide crack to double anchors on a large ledge. 100', 5.8+ C2.\n\nP4).  Move the belay right 25' to natural anchors.(Register here as there was no place to stash on the summit )  Traverse right past a bolt for about 30', then up a short bolt ladder to the summit.  Rap and belay anchors to the left.  60', 5.8 C1.\n\nDescent: Rap the route, taking care on overhanging sections.","protection":"Three sets of Cams from Aliens to two #5 Friends and One #6 Friend.Stoppers.
