Work around right on slabby shelves to the start of a short bolt-ladder. Aid up the bolts/drilled angles until you can free up a cleft to a roof with a fistcrack. There was a sizeable bush that was removed directly above this roof on the FA, it will likely be grown back in and need some work again. Wriggle up the flared chimney and OW cracks to a bedding seam ledge below a massive, somewhat spooky detached flake feature. Aid or free out the steep underside of the flake feature and wriggle up some more flared slot to the rad, flat summit.\n\nThere are the typical hollow flakes that accompany most Cedar Mesa sandstone routes, but overall this is pretty straightforward and relatively clean.\n\nRap to the south off of chained anchors, back into the cleft dividing the Butts Plug and the Proctologist's Finger with every bit of a 70m rope. It's a long rap, and you will probably have to rap off the ends and downclimb easy chimney a few feet to the dirt. Just watch the ends, pay attention, and it's fine.","protection":"In BD C4 sizes:\n\n(1X) .75\n\n(2X) #1-#3\n\n(1X) #4-#6\n\n(1X) 70m rope","location":"The route is the obvious crack/chimney feature on the SE side of the tower with bolts leading up to it."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,a31a5328-cc16-5787-bf2b-8379fabc7cdc,9071a597-e42e-5d7d-814f-9ef790cb2320,2ce75d9b-cef0-50c9-b1e0-d379fdde60a5","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Blanding","Arch Canyon","Butts Plug"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.7671,37.62572]},"bbox":[-109.76766774152178,37.62527033981814,-109.76653225847822,37.62616966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118010020","area_id":"LOddm87wUMmx4NN5/d5gpQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:46.327Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:32.573Z"}
