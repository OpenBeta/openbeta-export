I started with two beak placements to a cam and then a bolt(Sorry again for placing the bolt). Climb past the bolt into a sandy stem box.  Continue with free and aid to a notch where you join the original west side route. There was a drilled pin here that fell out as I chimneyed/off width past it. Chimney for 20’ to a ledge.  Place good small cams in a horizontal and mantle off your top steps onto the summit. The 2 bolt anchor is 30’ away on the northern edge.","protection":"Stoppers\n\nDouble .2-4\n\nSingle 5, 6\n\nA couple beaks and a small assortment of pins.\n\nSingle 70m rope","location":"This route is the left most crack on the east side of the tower."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,a31a5328-cc16-5787-bf2b-8379fabc7cdc,9071a597-e42e-5d7d-814f-9ef790cb2320,479193aa-aeff-521d-8ee5-53463240846e","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Blanding","Arch Canyon","Alpha Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.69329,37.55401]},"bbox":[-109.69385719477164,37.553560339818134,-109.69272280522837,37.554459660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117803057","area_id":"R5GTqq7/Uh2O5VNGMkCEbg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:46.327Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:32.181Z"}
