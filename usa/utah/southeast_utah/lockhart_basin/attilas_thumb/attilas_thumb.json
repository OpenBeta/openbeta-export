I did not do the moves free but I would guess more like 5.12ish. This route is not for everyone, Brad thought is sucked, I thought it was awesome.\n\nPitch one:\n\nStart up the loose crack system on the south face of the tower.  Pass a small roof on hand jams about 20' off the ground, continue on broken cracks to a two pin belay at a stance below a big roof.  We broke this pitch up in to two because of bad rope drag. A #6 camalot is very helpful at the top of this pitch. The book calls this 5.8 which it is not.  I would guess 5.10. (150'ish)\n\nPitch two:\n\nClimb out the right side of the roof to super fun climbing above.  Bring a #6 for above the roof to avoid some run out terrain. Climb into a chimney which is protected by a star bolt and a drilled pin.  Continue to a belay on a good ledge with two drilled angles. 5.11-. (just over 100')\n\nPitch three:\n\nClimb a wide crack in a corner for 20'.  Scramble through a wide crack to the other side and climb easy (5.7) unprotected terrain for 40' to a drilled pin.  Take a breather because this is where I think the 5.12 section is.  I aided up and stood on the pin and probably didn't climb anything harder then scary 5.10(if you fell you would back plant on a ledge). Continue up passed very loose blocks to a star bolt and some fun climbing.  Two pin hanging anchor is to your left. (175'ish)\n\nDescent:\n\nRappel the route.  The belays were placed so the rope would pull well and they do.","protection":"One set of stoppers, doubles from .3-4 camalot, one #5 and #6 camalot , runners and draws, two 60 meter ropes.","location":"The route starts on the south side of the tower."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,56be8721-0e15-572d-8fcb-b6f05b23ef01,0faf2761-3d45-5b77-afee-9652fd0fbf0b","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Lockhart Basin","Attila's Thumb"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.71081,38.39574]},"bbox":[-109.71138373668495,38.395290339818146,-109.71023626331502,38.39618966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106596187","area_id":"D68nYT1FW3ev7pZS/Q+/Cw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.71138373668495,38.395290339818146],[-109.71023626331502,38.395290339818146],[-109.71023626331502,38.39618966018187],[-109.71138373668495,38.39618966018187],[-109.71138373668495,38.395290339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:43.964Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:56.375Z"}
