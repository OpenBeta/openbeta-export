You're warned! Please, don't get Piggy Pinched. This route climbs the corner system just left of the obvious laser-cut, lightning bolt splitter crack (already climbed, no further known information; looks phenomenal!).\n\nPitch 1:\n\nBegin up a tight hand crack to a ledge. Then finesse through a short, wide section to another ledge. Turn right and enter a chimney. A fun hand crack in the chimney leads to a nice belay stance at a squarish notch.\n\n5.10, 105 feet.\n\nPitch 2:\n\nStem or climb out of the square notch to a thought-provoking finger sequence. Climb upward through a widening crack. Either OW battle or stem the widest section. Good pods make the length of this pitch barely tolerable. Finish up a smooth, surprisingly tricky wide section into a neat cave. This pitch is a fantastic, long blue-collar pitch.\n\n5.11, 160 feet.\n\nPitch 3:\n\nRamble up the cave and squeeze through a crack in the ceiling of the cave. Super fun! I'm 155 lbs with and it was fairly tight. It MIGHT be possible to continue through the cave latterly and crawl through a ratshit-filled tube and exit in the middle of the mesa. I would venture a person over 200lbs probably wouldn't make that crawl.\n\n5.9, 40 feet.\n\nUse a double rope rappel from the top of the laser-cut crack (2 pins) to a ledge. These pins are located southwest (~50 feet) from the top of Piggy Pincher. A single 70M rope rappel from the ledge (anchored via large block) then reaches the ground.","protection":"Double set from fingers to BD C4 #3.

I am hoping Dave Mealey sees this and has a better memory than me! I also had thought we did the 1st ascent of the Butte, but I believe a route was climbed on the West side in 2002 as well so who knows?\n\nThe 1st pitch starts at a short right facing dihedral that changed corners after 15' to be left facing. The pitch ends at a nice ledge with a single bolt.\n\nThe 2nd pitch follows a nice clean corner. I believe it started a little wide and slowly tapers down in size.\n\n3rd pitch was a little shorter, and the rock quality became weaker. I turned to some aid and probably made it scarier than it was because I believe Dave was able to follow it free without too much trouble.\n\nThis was named after my daughter born earlier in March of 2002.","protection":"Again fuzzy memories 2-3 sets of cams up to #3 BD and maybe one or 2 larger pieces. We left a registry and a 2 bolt anchor on top, but only a single bolt anchor for the 2nd rap station (top of the 1st pitch). The rock was bullet hard and it took us about an hour to place the one bolt with the hand drill.","location":"This route is located about half way across the East Face.
