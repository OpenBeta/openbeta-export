For the most part, this might as well be a solo climb for the lead climber.  Protection is nearly non-existant, especially on the 2nd pitch.  We did this route in 3 pitches, and on the 3rd pitch, we used a large flake about 30 feet into the chimney to place #4 & 5 friends.  The rock is very soft though, and these cams may not have held if we had actually taken a fall.  The solitude of this area along with the depth we progressed into this chimney created a separation from the rest of the world that was unbelievable.  The chimney is anywhere from 12 to 24 inches wide from the start of the 2nd pitch to the top.  It's a chimney lovers dream, or nightmare.  The 5.8 rating is acurate, but the fall potential makes this an extremely serious climb.  I loved this climb, but I have no intention of ever doing it again.

After that, while actually in the chimney, nothing short of a #4 bigbro will work.  Even the #4 will most likely be too short. You will basically be unprotected through most of the chimney.  The book \"Desert Rock: Wall Street to the San Rafael Swell\", shows bolt anchors at each belay; however, I couldn't see them and opted to head further into the chimney on the 2nd pitch to a large flake with a good platform to set my belay.  This is supposed to be a 4 pitch climb, but with 60 meter ropes, we did it in 3 pitches.   Decend from a rappel anchor on Merrymaker, to the right about 50 feet.

It follows the striking offwidth/chimney splitter that starts in a broad, overhanging wide corner.  There is a fixed hanging belay to the left of the crack about 80 feet up.  The first pitch is totally awesome clean wide-crack climbing, and would be great on its own.  The second pitch is easier, but the threat of rattling down the chimney until you've crumpled up into your own chockstone is defintely real.\n\nP1:  Start up a short low-angle finger crack behind a flake to a rapidly widening and steepening crack.  There are 4-5 bolts/drilled angles, but I thought it was nice to augment these with one of each camalot from #3 to #5.  Positive laybacking (spring-loaded for death, though), aesthetic stacking, and some blue-collar armbarring will get you to the first set of anchors.  The crux is passing the last bolt about 6 feet below the anchors. 5.11 OW.\n\nP2.  Continue up the ever-widening crack.  You might be able to get a tipped out #5 camalot or #6 friend for the first 10 feet, but after that, you'll need a saw and some long 4X4's.  There are two drilled angles, one at 20 feet off the belay, and one at 40 feet off the belay, for this 100 foot-long pitch.  I'd recommend just taking a few slings as pro for this pitch, as extra gear definitely gets in the way.  You can't really climb into the chimney until you pass the second pin.  This pitch is relatively secure, but defintely physical and serious.  There are few edges inside the crack.  The guidebook gave it 5.11, but I would call it a shade easier (5.10?).  It's less than vertical.  The 5.11 might just describe the pucker factor.\n\nAt the top, there are no fixed anchors, but I managed to get a pretty solid anchor by slinging a rock next to the crack about 35 feet back to the northwest from the top.\n\nDescent:  Rappel Merrymaker, about 50 feet to the left (180')","protection":"Pitch 1:  1 #2 camalot (optional first piece), 1 #3 camalot, 1 #3.5 camalot, 1 #4 camalot, 1-2 #4.5 camalots, 1 #5 camalot, 4-5 QDs for fixed drilled angles and bolts, all of which looked pretty solid.\n\nPitch 2:  2 QDs\n\nAnchor:  I slung a block next to the crack about 35 feet back from the top to the NW.
