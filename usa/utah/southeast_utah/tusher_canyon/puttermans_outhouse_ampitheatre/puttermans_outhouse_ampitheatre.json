Launch up through super sticky fingers which quickly widen to rattly fingers, then tight hands.  The route surprisingly ends at a small ledge, just as the crack goes locker hands.  It looked like this could probably continue with another 20 feet or so of great climbing.\n\nThe crack is ultra sharp/crisp.  It probably hasn't seen many ascents.  This is about as good as Entrada gets.  Bjornstadt gives it 10a ***** and Kelley gives it 10c ***.","protection":"Doubles of 0.3 camalots to #1 camalots, with extra in the 0.5 and 0.75 (maybe 3 or 4 each).\n\nThe anchor consists of a good 1/2\" bolt, an ~OK 3/8\" bolt, and an old friend.  When I climbed the route, one of the old 3/8\" bolts had fallen out of it's hole and was dangling in tat.  bring spare webbing and/or cord to spruce up the anchor if needed.","location":"Follow the wash South until you can make your way up left on some easy talus to the base of a big, sweet looking pink dihedral.  This will be above and to the right of Putterman's Outhouse, maybe a couple hundred feet.\n\n** Note: High Over Moab generally describes this as being on Neighbor of Putterman, which is one formation West of House of Putterman.  This isn't correct, it is actually approximately 2 formations East of House of Putterman and the driving approach is significantly different."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,7f9f03a9-a75f-530e-94bc-9577c4fa2d0a,f17b47e1-c47c-55ab-9844-99a5194c7384","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Tusher Canyon","Putterman's Outhouse Ampitheatre"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.75921,38.68526]},"bbox":[-109.75978605077177,38.684810339818135,-109.75863394922823,38.68570966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113889207","area_id":"8XtH4cR8VauYRJmlGUxzhA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.586Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:16.694Z"}
