It is named for the sandy hole through which it climbs.  The climbing is not spectacular, but it does gain a summit via a unique route.\n\nThe route actually starts on the big ledge at half-height on the end of the cliff (the west end, facing the House of Putterman formation).  There are two ways to access this ledge.  Either climb Putterman's Big Toe (5.9) or it's sister crack, Glob Gleab (C1), on the south face.  Both of these routes are described on this website.\n\nHowever you reach the ledge, walk back into the obvious cave (the cave is actually a huge chimney).  About 20 feet back into the 'cave', the walls pinch off.  The climb starts here.\n\nChimney through the slot (5.8+).  This is the Poopshoot.  After about 15 feet, the chimney opens up.  If you're facing INTO the deep chimney, the wall on your right continues up to overhanging choss, while the wall on your left continues up to slabby choss.  Slabby choss is easier to climb.\n\nTurn around so you're facing OUT of the chimney system.  Stem between the walls and work your way about 15-20 feet forward, so that you're standing directly above your belayer.  Climb the somewhat loose wall (5.5) to a short slot (5.8) which reaches the plateau of the 'south summit'.\n\nYou can set up a belay in a crack in the summit surface, using 2-4 inch cams.\n\nDescent:  There is no summit anchor.  Simul-rap, using a 60m rope.","protection":"Bring a handful of 1-3 inch pieces, and a few bigger pieces (2-4 inches) for the belay.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"LbL1wkbHVwuTwKnS7U3wAg==","name":"Putterman's Big Toe","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Brian Shelton/Jason Elliott","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.76682,38.68684]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"105717520","mp_crag_id":"105716970","climb_id":"LbL1wkbHVwuTwKnS7U3wAg==","areaRef":"VM7on2i8VjmACMj2i3KG+g=="},"content":{"description":"Route is on the north side of \"Neighbor of Putterman\".

Continue along the base of Neighbor of Putterman, a couple hundred feet past Fearless.  The route is hidden until you are right under it, located around a large right-facing corner.  A beautifully clean flake fills the center of the route, beginning 30 feet up on a huge ledge.  There is a large boulder on the ledge directly at the base of the flake.  It will be very obvious once you see it.\n\nPitch 1: Climb a loose, right-facing dihedral (5.8) to gain Gem Ledge.  The dihedral takes small nuts or micro cams, and is located to the left side of the large boulder.  Once on the ledge, tunnel behind the boulder to reach the base of the flake.\n\nPitch 2:  Climb the flake 100 feet to a 2-bolt anchor at a sloping, blocky ledge.  It starts at 2-3 inches, beautiful 5.8 hands.  Two-thirds of the way up the pitch, the flake widens to a 5.9 offwidth/layback, taking gear in the 4-5 inch range.  A phenomenal pitch.\n\nPitch 3:  From the ledge, ascend a short but steep handcrack (5.10, 10 feet).  Continue another 40 feet up the right-facing corner in a 4-5 inch offwidth that surmounts a couple of fun bulges (5.9).  Bring big gear.  The topout is a mantel!  Belay from a 3-bolt rap station just to the right of the topout.\n\nOnce on top, a short scramble will place you on the summit proper of the Neighbor of Putterman.\n\nDescent:  Rappel 180 feet to the ground with two 60m ropes.  With 50m ropes, do a tricky rappel to the anchor on top of Pitch 2.  Make sure you rappel down the route, not over the overhang.  Otherwise, you won't be able to swing to the anchor.  You could hike out, but it would be long and very, very circuitous.\n\nThis route is phenomenal, and we were amazed to find it!
