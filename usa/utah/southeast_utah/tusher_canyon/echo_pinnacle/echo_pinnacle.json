Climb up some good cracks (5.8) with a couple tricky moves and lots of jamming to the window.  From here, jam out the overhang on good hands that quickly turn to tight bastard hands in the dihedral (5.10+).  Follow this until you get to the bolt ladder protecting the chimney.  You now must climb the weirdest thing in the world (5.10+ squeeze) - you will be horribly confused, but it's some of the best climbing in the desert.  A couple unroped mantels on the summit (avoid the chipped edges on the first one for extra style points) lead to the top, and a gazillion new bolts (?).  One of the best towers in the desert.  Two double-rope raps get you down.","protection":"Bring a standard rack with a few extra #1 Camalots.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,7f9f03a9-a75f-530e-94bc-9577c4fa2d0a,f26da33f-a118-55fc-87a4-413f715c0a9c","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Tusher Canyon","Echo Pinnacle"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.7511,38.68334]},"bbox":[-109.75167603531551,38.682890339818144,-109.75052396468448,38.683789660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105716976","area_id":"8m2jP6EYVfyHpEE/cVwKnA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.75167603531551,38.682890339818144],[-109.75052396468448,38.682890339818144],[-109.75052396468448,38.683789660181866],[-109.75167603531551,38.683789660181866],[-109.75167603531551,38.682890339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.587Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:50.479Z"}
