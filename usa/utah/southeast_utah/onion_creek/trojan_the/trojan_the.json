It follows the ridge or spur (Edge) the entire way and rap anchors are available on all the towers to continue on the route which basically traverses from west to east. We called it \"Everyman's EE\" because we felt neither trickery and special aid gear nor an inordinate amount of courage is obligatory for subsequent climbers doing this route. It represents, due to its traversing nature, perhaps a new wave in the Fisher Tower area, yet never seems very desperate or too scary. We found the rock, for the most part, excellent quality for the area.\n\nPitch #1: Ascend the Chocolate Corners passing three bolts (placed to avoid a large hanging flake in the crack) to a tight squeeze section to a ledge and two bolt belay. 5.8, A0.\n\nPitch #2: Climb the Johnny Rotten Ridge into a gully past two bolts to the two bolt belay. 5.6, A1.\n\nPitch #3: Climb The Pancake Stack passing some funky nailing, two bolts and some dusty scrambling to another two bolt belay. 5.5, A1.\n\nPitch #4: Pass some pockets and bolts to a chimney to a nice ledge and two bolt belay.\n\nPitch #5: Cams and thin pins to a 5 bolt ladder brings the climber to a ledge. Continue around the corner to the left (5.6) and climb the wide OW protected by two bolts to another ledge, then round the tower (The Pancake)to the belay. 5.6, A1+.\n\nPitch #6: Chimney between the two towers and step across from the top of The Pancake to The Land of Joseph (the name of our favorite pancake syrup). Two bolts will assist you in reaching The Land OF Joseph summit and two bolt belay . 5.9+ or A1.\n\nPitch #7: Rappel to the notch and climb through an interesting chimney filled with two chockstones to a two bolt belay. 5.7.\n\nPitch #8: \"The Lightbulb Part Deux\". Mantle up to a big pocket and bolt ladder to some chossy easy climbing through the summit notch to the two bolt belay. 5.6, A1.\n\nPitch #9: An angling airy rap takes you to the notch and the belay...continue right on a nice ledge to a wide chimney. Belay on the ledge above. Potential great bivy. 5.10 or A0.\n\nPitch #10: \"The Hummingbird Perch\". Climb the moderate crack which widens to 3 bolts and a two bolt belay. A hummingbird greeted us on top. 5.8, A1.\n\nPitch #11: 3rd class down and lower off of a piton. The option of two gullies, take the left and much easy scrambling for a full rope length finds a two bolt belay on a slab. 5.4.\n\nPitch #12: Climb slabs to a notch between two towers and belay. 4th class.\n\nPitch #13: Climb on the left to the belay. 4th class.\n\nPitch #14: A crack to a bolt to some easy aid to another \"summit\". Step across and traverse right across the slab and belay. 5.8 or A1.\n\nPitch #15: \"The Trojan Horse Pitch\". Move left up the steepening final Tower passing some awkward steps to a good ledge under an overhang and belay. 5.9.\n\nPitch #16: \"The Reservoir Tip\". Make your way through some steep overlaps passing a bolt and fixed pin. Around the corner and past two more bolts brings one to a ledge and two-bolt belay. Great rock. A1.\n\nPitch #17: Fun and creative nailing protect this pitch up a left facing corner, then move right to a right facing corner and easier climbing to the final summit. 5.9, A0.\n\nDescent: Sign in at the register and rap two 50m raps to the ground. Hike down paralleling the ridge line to near the top of Pitch #11....one long rappel takes one to the top of a scree field which leads back to the gully. This will make sense as you climb the route and see where it would be logical to descend. Cairns mark the way from the scree field back to the gully and to Onion Creek.","protection":"All bolts were left with hangers. One full set of Camalots from micros to #5. A good selection of pitons from beaks to blades and LAs. Long generally better than short. Some pitons were left in place where expected repeated placements and removal would damage the rock. Take some additional slings to replace sun damaged rappel anchors.","location":"West Ridge of the Trojan. After crossing Onion Creek, find the 2-3rd class little canyon that is aimed directly at the south Face of the Titan. The first rock buttress encountered on the right is the start. Look for a right facing dihedral with a bolt visible about 10m up. This was placed to avoid disturbing a huge loose death flake in the crack at the time. This flake/block was trundled afterwards."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,b7466cbb-ab4e-5336-8026-ab75e2913dbd,478b1179-af0e-5641-99ad-63debd6791f1","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Onion Creek","Trojan, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.3137,38.6962]},"bbox":[-109.31427613886835,38.69575033981814,-109.31312386113166,38.69664966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105889160","area_id":"R4sRea8OVkGZrWPevWeR8Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.31427613886835,38.69575033981814],[-109.31312386113166,38.69575033981814],[-109.31312386113166,38.69664966018186],[-109.31427613886835,38.69664966018186],[-109.31427613886835,38.69575033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:43.954Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:55.887Z"}
