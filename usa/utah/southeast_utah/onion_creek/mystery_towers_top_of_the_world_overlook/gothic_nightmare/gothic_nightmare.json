That being said, it is a bit sandbagged and you will want some Fisher's experience unless you have cajones or ovaries of steel/brass.  Here is the breakdown on the pitches.  I will refer to the pitches listed in the Desert Rock III book although on our ascent we deviated a bit.\n\nP1- Broke this honker of a pitch down into two pitches.  P1a- Start in a right facing crack/roof system off the ground.  Make sure to go through the roof and NOT around right.  Follow rivets and beaks up.  We changed leads and back-cleaned about mid-way through the rivet ladder in order to have enough rope to make it to the anchors. P1b- Use some ju-ju to bypass missing section of rivet ladder and then follow mostly clean aid up to a sloping belay ledge with 3 bolts.(210' total)\n\nP2-\"Free Gothic\" pitch.  This pitch will go free with some more cleaning.  Otherwise, big gear \"2\" and up\" takes you up to the next belay ledge(150')\n\nP3-\"A1 pitch\" A bunch of the rivets have ripped on this pitch I believe.  Regardless, bring some small beaks, a bunch of rivet hangers and a good eye for rivets and mantles.(140')\n\nP4-\"Money\" Sweet bolt/rivet clip up wild climbing to the summit ridge(70').\n\nP5- \"The summit walk\" Smear around the loosley attached alien head, aid up two bolts, and perform the doom mantle.  This old 1/4\"er could probably be replaced at some point.(fun time')\n\nRAPS: Do a single rap down from the summit, reclimb past the alien head and then bomb down the route.","protection":"Standard Mud Rack( 1 #5 usefull and small beaks also helpful)","location":"The route is pretty obvious from the ground on the SW side of the tower, there is a little bit of fixed gear in the starting crack too."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,b7466cbb-ab4e-5336-8026-ab75e2913dbd,b7c683a3-09ba-52f5-a179-3ab30662dfb6,9917058b-47fc-55d9-8f91-2b3f158b1b02","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Onion Creek","Mystery Towers & Top of the World Overlook","Gothic Nightmare"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.28347,38.7183]},"bbox":[-109.28404631697943,38.71785033981814,-109.28289368302055,38.718749660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106396286","area_id":"mRcFi0f8VdmPkSs/FYsbAg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.28404631697943,38.71785033981814],[-109.28289368302055,38.71785033981814],[-109.28289368302055,38.718749660181864],[-109.28404631697943,38.718749660181864],[-109.28404631697943,38.71785033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:45.033Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:19.603Z"}
