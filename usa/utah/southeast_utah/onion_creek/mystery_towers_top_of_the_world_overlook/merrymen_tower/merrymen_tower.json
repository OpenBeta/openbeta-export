The chimney turns right and narrows into a squeeze chimney. Continue upwards as the squeeze chimney becomes a stem between two towers.\n\nJust when the route doesn't seem obvious, do a dubious traverse along the west face of the tower and belay at a small ledge with a wide crack.\n\nPitch 2 - 5.8 20 feet.\n\nClimb up the wide crack, only a few moves, to the summit hoodoo. An exciting mantel leads to the summit.  The mantel must be down-climbed.\n\nDescent\n\nRappel 115 feet, webbing slung around a hoodoo for an anchor, down the west side of the tower.
