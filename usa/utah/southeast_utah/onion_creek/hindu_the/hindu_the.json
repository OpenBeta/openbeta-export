This a cool tower with an interesting route up the \"North Face\". Locate the ledge where the route begins...Pitch one starts with some bouldery moves and then goes left on mostly good rock to an anchor (10). Pitch 2 goes up a cool scoop to a sweet arete slapping boulder problem protected by a good bolt (crux, good pro)...Now for the excitement...Traverse right on a horizontal system and unload a bunch of gear. Scratch and claw up a heinous silty bulge with a crack going through it (11- R, arches-scary). Last pitch wraps its way around to the left passing some fixed junk and joins up with the south route near the top (10). In all its an OK route with a cool bouldery crux...But, it IS a nice tower!!","protection":"One set of wires. Double set of cams from .5 - 3.5 Friends. 2 60M ropes (rap).
