Work upwards, with thinner placements on the face to gain a vertical, right-facing flake. Continue up this somewhat hollow flake through the bulge to belay at two bolts.\n\nP2:   A3-  80ft\n\nFrom the belay step right, up a seam to the overhang, work right around the overhang and continue right towards a big flaring butt. Grapple directly with this and gain a two-bolt belay.\n\nP3:  A3  50ft\n\nFrom belay step right into the mud groove. Continue upwards, nailing, stemming and mantling your way towards a thin seam through a bulge (bolt). Just below the saddle, find a path through the gray band of compressed kitty litter to two-bolt belay on saddle.\n\nP4:  A2     60ft\n\nShuffle across the land bridge then tunnel your way left towards a bolt. Traverse a few more feet to a consistent crack that will take you up past a large ledge to two good bolts just below the summit.\n\nP5:    A2   15ft\n\nFrom belay, step right to a crack, follow to the summit. This can be combined with P4; the two bolts were placed on the last bit of solid rock and in the face of an incoming thunderstorm.\n\nDescent:\n\nRappel 15 feet from webbing wrapped around the summit gargoyle to the 2-bolt anchor. Rappel 60 feet from here to the “land bridge” and the 2-bolt anchor atop P3. From here, a single rappel with two 70m ropes reaches the ground.","protection":"Gear:\n\nPitons: I set “Universal” pitons, 2 Spectres, 15 beaks/peckers, selection regular pins from knifeblades, Lost Arrows, a few small/med angles, 1 Warthog.\n\nCams: 2 each: Green Alien to #1 Camalot, 1 each: larger cams to #5 Camalot\n\nSmall selection of nuts/stopperheads","location":"This route takes the southeast face pretty directly.
