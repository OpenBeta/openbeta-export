Work up and into a vertical groove and continue to a 2-bolt anchor (85’ A3).\n\nPitch 3: Step right. Soft rock transitions to hard dirt with embedded cobbles. Once past the slot between the two Mini-Cooper-size boulders, reach easier ground and a 2-bolt belay on the summit block (A2+, “R”, 40’).\n\nScramble 10’ to the summit.\n\nDescent: Downclimb from the summit to the topmost bolts.
