One bolt, followed by thin beaking leads to double bolt anchor on ridgeline(A2). Start almost exactly on the southernmost portion of the ridge.\n\nP2-Follow intermixed bolts and beaks to large offwidth. End at double bolt belay at looking glass on the ridgeline. This pitch follows the original line on the Hydra. (5.8, A2) P2-4 follow original ascent line on Hydra\n\nP3-Go up and right from belay to gain walkway along ridgeline. Follow rivets, beaks, and free climbing to double bolt belay on ridgeline. This pitch follows the original line on the Hydra.  (5.7, A1)\n\nP4-Head straight up from belay on beaks. Perform ice axe toss/lasso. Jug up off ice axe places intermittent beaks for back-up. Arrive at top of hydra fin. Slung horn and bolt for belay. This pitch follows the original line on the Hydra. This pitch separates the men from the boys. (A3-A4 depending on ice axe skills)\n\nP5-Charon's Ride. Mixed free and aid across wild, convoluted ridgeline of hydra. Jumps between hoodos necessary. End pitch by rapping down to lowest notch on ridgeline, where there is a double bolt belay. 2.5 ropes can be fixed from here to the ground.

Continue upwards in trough with solid beaking. Ultimately trend right using a mix of cams, and free and aid to arrive at a Hades Chair, a large 6x12 ledge on the ridgeline. Ropes can be fixed here to the ground using stations. (5.7, A2)\n\nP10-Crossing the Acheron. Continue up ridgeline using mostly bolts and occasional beaks. Enter the gaping maw at the caprock, and free climb out the caprock roof using large cams. Belay on double bolt anchor on nice ledge. (5.8, A1)\n\nP11- Mix free/aid up caprock to double bolt belay on top of pillar, at large ledge.

The climb starts with a bolt ladder. This route will likely go all free after a couple more ascents. While this route doesnt climb a tower, it does put you in a totally awesome place way back in the towers. The exposure on P4 is spectacular and is likely the most overhanging pitch in the Fishers or Mystery Towers, and perhaps the most overhanging pitch on Cutler. Pitches below 4 stay dry in the rain and snow. Subsequent parties will likely be able to do this in a day.\n\nP1- Start at obvious bolt ladder interspersed with easy hooking and occasional #1 beak placements. 23 bolts to the anchor. This pitch will likely go free at hard 5.11 (~140).\n\nP2-Head up the crack above the anchor using occasional beaks and cams. Continue up with additional passing two bolts into another crack on the right. (A2, ~110).\n\nP3  Head up the phenomenal splitter arching up and left. Two #1 beaks were the only iron placed on this pitch. A large smattering of cams and stoppers are needed. Do not hammer this crack, as it will not last. The #1 beaks were used to bypass a loose part of the flake. This pitch would probably go free around 5.11. (A1 (Mostly C1/0) ~110)\n\nP4  Head up in into the roofs.  Wild pitch. Go up the loose flake (DO NOT NAIL) directly above the belay, into the corner leading to the obvious roof splitter. Two bolts protect the arête, and there is one after the roof to move into the second roof. This pitch is worth the climb. (A2, 90)\n\nP5  Head right to a splitter crack that leads up and right to a belay about 10 feet below the summit. This pitch went mostly clean, just 2-#3 beak placements and would likely go free at ~ 5.10 (A1, 100)\n\nDescent: Rap the route.
