Guess again.  We found this climb to NOT be an easy tick. We couldn't find an easy way to get to this tower, and it took a long time to get to the base, because we had to rope up, lead a 5.10 crack section, etc...and we still hadn't even reached the BASE of the climb! The first part of the climb is , yeah,...5.7.....with protection being pitons hammered into mud.  Then you get to this bolt ladder section of pitons hammered into drilled holes;...only the holes weren't drilled deep enough , and the pitons are sticking WAY out;...it was sort of scary. Anyways;...we finally got to the summit, and survived this climb. Even though this climb has it's \"issues\"...we still had a fun adventure, and were glad we did it.  I believe Eric Kohl and Beth Shilliday did another route on this spire; probably on the opposite side....I think it's a bit harder than this one...","protection":"Cams small to large, maybe 10 pins ( LA's to angles)9, some tie-offs.","location":"Located just under the Kingfisher.
