To approach, hike the trail to inbetween Cottontail Tower and the Titan and hike up the hill to the base of the route.\n\nP1- This used to be some free climbing and some tricky moves but unfortunately somebody has drilled a bolt ladder. Climb the bolt ladder to the ledge directly below Run Amok.  Traverse left on the ledge until you come to thin cracks that rise from the left end of the ledge.\n\nP2- Difficult thin nailing on a very steep wall to a hanging belay at bolts.  (A3+)\n\nP3- Moderate nailing in a right leaning corner which progressively gets harder and scarier until you reach another hanging belay at bolts.  (A3)\n\nP4- Climb the steep mud curtain above and into a chimney system with nailing and hooking.  The belay is from bolts on the outside of the chimney on the right side.  (A3)\n\nP5- Climb a bolt ladder to some 5.9 free climbing in a chimney (really good)  When the free climbing runs out, climb another long bolt ladder to a shallow alcove.  Above the alcove some very shallow knifeblade moves will get you to a small diving board formation where you make a mantle.  From there, a difficult move gets you to another short bolt ladder and another hanging belay.  (A3+)\n\nP6- Nail a moderate corner and then more difficult aid to the top of the tower.\n\nTo descend, rappel the opposite side of the tower from the routes final anchors down a deep, wide chimney called the bowels of the tapeworm.  Its 4 or 5 raps to get down.  The descent is clean and hassle free.\n\nJohn Slezak and I did the second ascent of this route in full winter conditions in December of 1994.  We climbed it without fixed ropes and bivied in portaledges for three nights.  It was cold, and for the first three days there were blizzards of snow and slush.  One storm happened while John was leading the chimney on pitch four.  I was at the belay and mud and water poured out of the chimney next to me for a couple hours.  It was like being next to a chocolate waterfall.  The final day of the climb was my 19th birthday.  The summit was a good birthday present.","protection":"Full aid rack- Pins from beaks to big angles, two sets of cams from tiny to #4 Camalot.

This is an obvious natural line - a rarity in the Fisher Towers.  The route has a grand total of two fixed pieces, both of which are on the first pitch, and then the last short bolt ladder on the North Chimney route to gain the summit.  The route gets no sun at all, so its best to do in late spring or even summer.\n\nHike up towards Ancient Art and the Kingfisher.  After scrambling up a 4th class section, look for a climbers trail that contours around the back of the side canyon to the shoulder of Echo Tower furthest from Cottontail Tower.  The route follows the obvious crack systems.\n\nPitch 1 - Scramble up an easy 5.4 chimney for 40 feet to the splitter where the tower gets steep.  Aid up a continuous crack which is sometimes wide and very awkward in places.  Uncomfortable belay at a small stance.  190' 5.4 C2  This can be done as two pitches with a belay on top of the chimney.\n\nPitch 2 - Make some dirty C2 moves into a wide crack, and then into an amazing clean crack which moves right and then back left before going up to a hanging belay.  100', mostly C1.  This is the best pitch on the route.\n\nPitch 3 - Head straight up good C1 cracks above the belay, and trend right when necessary.  A combination of aid moves and tension traversing brings you right into a wide crack.  Tension traverse right to the hanging belay when possible.  100', C2.\n\nPitch 4 - Climb up through roofs above the belay - this is the crux climbing on the route and gets hard right off the belay.  Don't fall - there is a lot to hit, but the hard climbing is pretty short.  Free climb 5.9 offwidth and chimney to a good ledge - much you can french free but the last bit to the ledge is mandatory free.  This is grunty but protects pretty well.  90', 5.9 CC.\n\nPitch 5 - Climb the 8 bolt ladder finish to the North Chimney.  This was formerly really bad bolts and the psychological crux, but now has been rebolted by Sam Lightner - thanks!   45', C0.\n\nFrom here you are on top of the summit ridge.  The actual highpoint is a 30' poorly protected and precarious 5.6 scramble, which must be downclimbed.  The summit ridge is spectacular.\n\nThe route was also freed at 5.12 by Stevie Haston.  Good luck if you want to repeat that!\n\nMake a double rope rap to the top of pitch 3, another to the top of pitch 1(be\n\nvery careful not to go too low before swinging right.  might be a good idea to leave a rope fixed between 1-3 to ease getting into the anchors).  One more double rope rap gets you to the ground.  60 meter ropes are a good idea - you will have to do a bit of downclimbing in the easy chimney without them.\n\nAlternatively, rap down Iron Chef to avoid the swing to the P1 anchors.","protection":"3 sets cams from black alien through 3 camalot, doubles in the 4, 4.5, and 5 camalot size, extra 2.5\" - 3.5 inch cams, 1 set of stoppers, large offset nuts, medium tricams, a few large lowe balls are nice, long slings to prevent rope drag, and all the guidebooks call for a large hook though we didn't use one.
