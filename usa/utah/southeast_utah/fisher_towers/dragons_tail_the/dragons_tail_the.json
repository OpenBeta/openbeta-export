Some C1 placements or free climbing will be required about 3/4 of the way up to the saddle.  100 feet, 5.6 C1.  Word on the street is this pitch frees around 5.10+.\n\nP2 - Walk northeast on the narrow ridge to the base of the southeast face and start clipping bolts (many stubs).  Near the top, mandatory free mud climbing will be required before clipping 3 bolts to the top.  120 feet, 5.6 C0.\n\nRappel the route.  Make sure your rope is 200 feet long as a single 60M rope barely reaches the saddle from the top.  A 70M rope is recommended.\n\nRap 1 (2 bolts) - 100 feet\n\nRap 2 (2 bolts) - 95 feet","protection":"Single rack BD 0.4-3.  12-15 rivet hangers OR 2 sets of smaller nuts.
