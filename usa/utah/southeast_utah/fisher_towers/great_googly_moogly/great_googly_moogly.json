Start up a fisty, awkward thrutch up to a scary, right-angling dirt ramp. Work up to the overhanging OW to a ledge/rest. The offwidth is steep but offers good friction on the Carhartts and some good cobbles on the inside to help out with the thrutchery. After the rest, a few more squeezy moves get you to the anchors. A short, easy scramble gets you to the summit.","protection":"Medium and large stoppers, set of TCUs/Aliens, hand and fist sized cams, #5 Friend or similar.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,6d2dca56-4ef3-5eca-82de-19ef638461db,b57f620f-8169-55ff-9ad4-ed0993671bcb","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Fisher Towers","Great Googly Moogly"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.30612,38.7239]},"bbox":[-109.30669636214279,38.723450339818136,-109.3055436378572,38.724349660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105823643","area_id":"tX9iD4FpVf+a1O0Jk2cbyw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.30669636214279,38.723450339818136],[-109.3055436378572,38.723450339818136],[-109.3055436378572,38.724349660181865],[-109.30669636214279,38.724349660181865],[-109.30669636214279,38.723450339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:46.329Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:00.343Z"}
