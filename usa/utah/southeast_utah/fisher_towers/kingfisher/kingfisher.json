This route is nearly entirely new ground - with the exception of 1.5 pitches of the Minatour route put up by Duane Raleigh. We were able to avoid Jagged Edge by heading onto the southwest face. All bolts are 3/8th inch, most are 3 or 4 inches. Route lengths are approximate---it was raging hot so we may have been delirious.\n\nP1- 150' A1 (no bolts, bolted anchor). Up cracks toward notch.\n\nP2 - 110' A1 (no bolts, bolted anchor). More of the same.\n\nP3-  50'  5.6 C1 (no bolts, gear belay). Up small offwidth to dwarf crawl around right.\n\nP4- 180' 5.9+ A1+ (no new bolts, gear belay). This route has one bolt that was part of the Duane Raleigh Minotaur route. Long sweet pitch. It is 2 ropes to the ground from here on the southwest side using the P4 and P3 anchors.\n\nP5- 100' 5.7 A1 (2 bolts, bolted anchors). Traverses under the head of the Minotaur. Requires some lower off shenanigans.\n\nP6- 40' rap onto SW face onto dirt ledge. 5.3 walk east on dirt ledge (bolted anchor).\n\nP7- 90' 5.6 A1. Cool hole going into the heart of the Kingfisher.....horrible roof to surmount. (1 bolt, bolted anchor).\n\nP8- 30' 5.5. Dangerous jump between hoodoos (1 bolt, bolted anchor, 1 rope to ground on the southwest side).\n\nP9- 130' 5.6 A2 (7 bolts, bolted anchor). Traverse straight right into a beak seam, then up and right with intermittent free/aid climbing onto southwest face.\n\nP10-100' A2 (2 bolts, bolted anchor). Continue to head up and right.\n\nP11- 130' A2+ (10 bolts, bolted anchor). Straight up the beak seam until it bottoms out. Big loose flake midway up pitch directly above your belayer - tread lightly choss ninja.\n\nP12 - 75' 5.8 A1 (2 bolts, bolted anchor). Go through Moenkopi caprock roof, then left to obvious corner.\n\nP13- 35' 5.6 C1 (no bolts, bolted anchor). Go right from belay up cracks to dirt scramble.\n\nScramble to summit, then scramble back down. Single rope raps to the belay at P11. Then it is 3 double rope raps to ground. There is an anchor out on the face (not part of the route) about 150' below P10 anchors.","protection":"Doubles set of cams from 0.3-#4 BD cam.

Pitch one has some thin nailing and heading right off the ground passing a couple of bolts, and then nails a good leftward arching corner.  Pitch two climbs left then up into a nice right facing corner.  After the corner climb up a scary mud curtain to a bad bolt and then into a tricky wide crack to the belay.  The third pitch climbs 5.10 and some nailing up to a pendulum point.  Pendulum right to a ledge and then nail a thin crack to the belay.  There is ledge fall potential on this pitch.  Pitch four climbs difficult thin cracks with thin pins and heads up to a roof which is steep and awkward.  Climb the caprock for about 30 feet to a ledge.  The last pitch is 5.9 wide crack climbing to the top.   This route is a great, hard nailing route on one of the best lines in the Fishers.  To descend, rappel the Colorado Northeast ridge route.   Jim Beyer did the first ascent, solo in the late '80s.","protection":"Heavy nailing rack including aluminum heads.

The climbing is relatively clean, quick and easy.  The exposure is fantastic.  This route climbs the left hand arete of King Fisher as viewed from the parkinglot.  To reach the route, hike out to the Cobra (just past Ancient Art).  From there, hike up the hill past Death of American Democracy, and just below the northeast arete, you'll see the first pitch bolt ladder.\n\nP1- Climb a bolt ladder which used to be very scary, but now has a couple good bolts on it to a hanging belay. P2- Climb a fun 5.8 chimney with lots of holds and good gear.  Pitch 1 and 2 can easily be combined. P3- This is the crux pitch and has fun aid moves with a few mantle moves onto dirty, sloping ledges.  The last 20 feet before the belay is the crux and climbs some scary, old fixed gear.   P4- Climb the bolt ladder, with one hook move up to the roof where the rock changes from Cutler to Moenkopi Sandstone.  Climb up and left over the roof and onto the caprock.  Above the roof there is a short bolt ladder to a huge belay ledge. P5- The last pitch free climbs a short hand crack to a short 5.8 chimney to the summit.\n\nTo descend, rappel the route","protection":"Two sets of cams from tiny to #4 camalot, Micro Nuts and stoppers.
