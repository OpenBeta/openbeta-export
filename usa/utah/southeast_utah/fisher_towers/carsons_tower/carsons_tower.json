Then comes the one and only aid move. Stick a lousy cam into a flaring crack (maybe offset cams would work a lot better!), pray that it won't pull, and step up on it. Hope the piece holds, and don't slip, because a fall will land you unpleasantly on the ledge. Once past that move, sling the funky horn with a cordalette, make a couple moves and sling another horn with a regular-length sling. Then comes the free climbing crux. It involves a slopey, sandy 5.8 mantle. If you fall, you'll pendulum down and left... After the mantle you can clip the anchors.\n\nSee topo pic for more beta.\n\nAs far as I know, this is a new route. If not, let me know and I'll fix it. Not that it means much in the Fishers, but the cracks were very dirty and muddy before I cleaned them out a bit, making me think that it probably hasn't been climbed before. The aid move could perhaps be freed without too much difficulty, but it sure would be scary above that ledge...","protection":"A set of cams, one large nut.
