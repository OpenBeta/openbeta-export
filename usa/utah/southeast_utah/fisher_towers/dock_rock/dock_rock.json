The route wanders and is mostly not very exposed, so it is a good route to solo.  Climb broken rock up to a large ledge system.  Traverse right and up past a two bolt anchor - I have no idea what that is for.  Wind around the back side of the formation and up to the summit ridge.  There are several sets of rap anchors on top, and you can just barely make it down with one 60 meter rope from the rightmost anchors.","protection":"Light rack of cams should protect it.  Bring lots of slings or you may have terrible rope drag.
