Its size and position is unrivaled and it is truly the monarch of arches in the region. It is composed of very good Cedar Mesa Sandstone and can now be done entirely hammerless and much of it goes free. At the time of its first ascent it was the largest unclimbed arch on the planet.\n\nThe first ascent of Angel Arch in 1991 followed the obvious wide crack on the east side of the formation.  A rope was fixed over the hump to the north so that they could climb over the hump on the descent.  There is a large flat ledge above the center of the arch. The fourth pitch followed a drilled pin ladder to the summit. The descent follows the route.  All anchors are hidden from view.\n\nIt must be noted that the NPS looks down on climbing named features in these particular national parks. \"Named features\" translates in NPS speak to \"arches.\" They don't seem to mind people climbing the towers and various formations, but for whatever reason they do not like climbers on the arches. If you are caught climbing Angel, Castle, or Druid arch, you will likely be issued a compulsory \"arch climbing permit\", which cost $25 in 1993.  As always, practice sound and environmentally-minded judgement in the desert. It is particularly important that the \"leave no visible trace\" philosophy be exercised here.","protection":"Some wide stuff for the first pitch.  Some nerve for the second.  An extra rope for the third. Drilled anchors are where you need them.","location":"Once upon a time you could drive a 4wd high clearance vehicle down Salt Creek to within a mile of the arch.  The environmental groups sued the NPS and closed the road.  The battles have been in and out of court, and the road has been closed, reopened, and closed again over the years.  Currently the road down Salt Creek is closed to mechanized vehicles.  One can park at the Peekaboo  campsite and backpack the 10 miles in to the arch down Salt Creek.  The approach is easy hiking along the old road, and there is \"at large\" camping allowed in this section of the canyon.  A permit is required. This is a fantastic hike and comes extremely well recommended. Plan on three days for this adventure. A day for the hike in, a day for exploring and bouldering, and a day for the hike out."},"__v":0},{"_id":"AagktaTBXg2VTfuNCm4i1A==","name":"Druid Arch","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Midkiff, solo, February, 1987","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.8173,38.1759]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105966400","mp_crag_id":"105849593","climb_id":"AagktaTBXg2VTfuNCm4i1A==","areaRef":"E1dmTJNKV8abpvbiVtrsjQ=="},"content":{"description":"Closed to climbing:\n\nThis route is illegal to climb and has been left on Mountain Project for historical purposes\n\nonly\n\n.

It is a majestic arch with a commanding view from the summit.\n\nThe route follows the obvious crack system on the left hand side of the arch when viewed from the trail. The first pitch followed a very nice crack  to a nice ledge. Pitch 2 climbed up the face and to the right to another nice ledge. The third pitch followed the slightly overhanging dihedral through a short roof and diagonals up and to the right. The crack ends and one traversed on huecos and face holds to just below the summit saddle.  Anchors were up there that allowed a return to the nice ledge.","protection":"Standard.\n\nIt's interesting to note that when Midkiff soloed this on the FA, he removed the springs from his Gibbs ascenders so that they would slide on the rope both ways.  This resulted in a big whipper at one point.  Kicking off the wall as he fell engaged the cam and halted the plummet. Yikes.","location":"It is relatively easy to reach compared to the other Needles District arches, and this means that the potential for tourist traffic is substantially increased. It is a popular day-hike destination and rightly so for it is the most striking landmark for miles. It is reached by driving to the base of Elephant Hill and finding the trailhead there leading to Chessler Park and Elephant Canyon. Druid Arch is located at the southern end of Elephant Canyon. It is about a 5.4 mile (9 km) hike to the arch over slickrock, sand flats and a dry creek bed; follow the cairns. There are a couple of backcountry campsites lower in the canyon (with permit); the NPS does not allow camping in the Druid Arch corridor. The route is located on the east side of the arch's south leg."},"__v":0},{"_id":"QSyauJ58V4q75D5DU8cBDg==","name":"Castle Arch","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"Anderton, Duncan, Kohlhaas, Peddy","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"X","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.8173,38.1759]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105966573","mp_crag_id":"105849593","climb_id":"QSyauJ58V4q75D5DU8cBDg==","areaRef":"E1dmTJNKV8abpvbiVtrsjQ=="},"content":{"description":"Closed to climbing:\n\nThis route is illegal to climb and has been left on Mountain Project for historical purposes\n\nonly\n\n.

It is perched on a very thin fin of rock which is not apparent until you stand at the very base of the arch itself. From here you realize that it is possible to see light through three places in the arch. The base of the arch is also extremely narrow on the west side and it is offset, so that when you peer through any of the holes on the summit all that you can see is space. It is a very exhilarating experience to stand on this arch! It is also an adventure to climb. The route never exceeds about 5.5 in difficulty, but the climbing is airy in nature and there is little protection.\n\nThe route on Castle Arch ascended the south face and then the east buttress of the arch. From the western side of the south face, one traversed right on a bedding seam for roughly 15-20 feet (4.5-6 m), and then climbed up to the next bedding seam. The FA party continued to traverse on this seam until they attained the next bedding seam up. They followed the path of least resistance (up and right) until they gained the ledge at the base of the arch. You can see how narrow the base of the arch is in the photo below. From this ledge, they followed the low-angle chimney to the east to gain the buttress next to the arch. They fixed a line from the tree so they could lower themselves down into the notch between the buttress and the arch. It is only 10-12 feet (3 m) or so down to the arch.","protection":"X means X, but some big bros and large cams were useful, at least for psychological protection.","location":"Castle Arch is located in a branch of Horse Canyon in the Needles District. Fortunately, the environmental group that sued to have Salt Creek Canyon closed to vehicles, failed in their efforts to close Horse Canyon. This is an unusual stroke of luck for us because Horse Canyon is the adjacent drainage to the east from Salt Creek. It is strange that it remains open while Salt Creek is closed, but the courts are often inconsistent in their logic.  To find Castle Arch, take a four wheel drive high clearance vehicle down Horse Canyon almost to its end (after you secure a backcountry permit from the NPS). There should be a small sign pointing to the drainage and trail leading to the arch. Follow this trail for ½ mile (1 km) to reach the arch; some scrambling will be involved.\n\nThe descent was done by downclimbing to the base of the arch and using large cams to anchor the rappel line. Rappel to the north. One individual down climbed the route after everyone else rappelled.  Hats off to Mr. Peddy."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,1357664c-934a-57c6-9ba6-f6e256daec8d","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Needles District, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":2,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":2,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.8173,38.1759]},"bbox":[-109.81787200164283,38.17545033981814,-109.81672799835718,38.176349660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105849593","area_id":"E1dmTJNKV8abpvbiVtrsjQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:43.947Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:28.219Z"}
