Follow the splitter up as it gets thinner.  Get as high as possible and stick clip a drilled pin above.  This section maybe could be passed without the stick clip with multiple of the smallest Lowe balls but maybe not.  Continue up easier aiding to a steep section and head left.  There is an old empty drilled pin hole here that I didn’t use but might work for bat hooking or a hand placed baby angle. Tiny cams led to a dead end for me so I used a stick clip to place a #5 in a flare above then free climbed off that placement to a stance and more easy free to a big ledge. 5.10 C3 120’ (I found climbing shoes helpful on this pitch since I climbed out of my aiders multiple times.)\n\nPitch 4-\n\nDR1 says head up and right. After looking that way I opted to head up and left.  Aid off the ledge and around the corner free climbing in spots.  Pass a  fixed pin and continue to another ledge.  Anchor was a combo of fixed pins and #4 cams.  5.9 C2 80’\n\nPitch 5-\n\nA drilled angle leads to ledge, two more fixed angles leads to another. I stick clipped a final drilled angle but you could probably free climb to it. The summit anchor is a 10’ scramble below the true summit. 5.8 C1 80’\n\nDescent-\n\nA single rope rappel got us to the top of pitch 4, where there was a rappel anchor on the prow that wasn’t mentioned in DR1. Then another single rope rap to the top of pitch 3. Then a double rope rap to the top of pitch 2. We skipped the P1 anchor and did one more double rope rap to the ground.","protection":"Single #5\n\nDoubles from .75-#4\n\nTriples from 000-.5\n\nHybrid aliens\n\nLowe balls\n\nSelection of offset stoppers\n\nTwo ropes\n\nTat","location":"Route starts on the left side of the northeast face.  Anchor on pitch one is visible from the ground."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,2dfdb657-4194-5c35-8d71-416488c6bbf9,c0908801-c00e-560c-9bcc-339f4eff1964","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Island In The Sky","Sandcastle"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.8395,38.39127]},"bbox":[-109.84007370121738,38.390820339818134,-109.83892629878261,38.391719660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120547112","area_id":"wJCIAcAOVgybzDOfTv8ZZA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.84007370121738,38.390820339818134],[-109.83892629878261,38.390820339818134],[-109.83892629878261,38.391719660181856],[-109.84007370121738,38.391719660181856],[-109.84007370121738,38.390820339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.387Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:24.210Z"}
