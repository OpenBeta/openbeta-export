Up and right to a shallow slot 15 feet up (5.10). Continue straight up, then slightly left through a finger crack in a small roof. Face climb left of the blocky crack above to a ledge below the higher mud band. Traverse 15 feet right, then up through another bulging finger crack. Belay on a cramped ledge (5.10b, 60 feet).\n\n2. Up the short chimney above, past stacked blocks, to a slabby ledge (you'll be below another chimney). Traverse thirty feet left on the wild hanging slab to gain the base of the nice crack. Up ten feet and belay on a ledge (5.9, 60 feet).\n\n3. Romp up the crack. Belay on a ledge on the right (5.9, 30 feet).\n\n4. Angle up and left, straight up over a small bulge, then left again to gain the east arete and the summit (5.8, 40 feet).","protection":"Many wires, especially medium/large. 2-3 sets Aliens, 2-3 sets Friends/Camalots up to 4-inch. QDs, runners. Double ropes.","location":"Start on the north side, ten feet right of the high spot in the talus. After a steep muddy start the route accesses the prominent clean crack in the upper middle of the face.\n\nDescent: There is no fixed gear on the climb. To descend, use two ropes tied together and draped over the top, one hanging down each face. We used a 70m on the longer south face and a 60m, and these reached OK. Take care setting this up. It may be better to go one person at a time rather than both at once, to help communication. Once the party is down, the ropes can be pulled."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,2dfdb657-4194-5c35-8d71-416488c6bbf9,322f03bc-1ab8-582b-99e0-2a8cd5fc0322,6e3f11ab-e766-5d90-8079-12de3d94d375","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Island In The Sky","Monument Basin","Captain Collywobble"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b/c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.83247,38.28334]},"bbox":[-109.83304284722436,38.282890339818145,-109.83189715277564,38.28378966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109236187","area_id":"bj8Rq+dmXZCAeRLePZTTdQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.83304284722436,38.282890339818145],[-109.83189715277564,38.282890339818145],[-109.83189715277564,38.28378966018187],[-109.83304284722436,38.28378966018187],[-109.83304284722436,38.282890339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.394Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:24.953Z"}
