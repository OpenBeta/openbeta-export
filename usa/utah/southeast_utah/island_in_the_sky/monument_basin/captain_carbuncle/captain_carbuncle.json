Climb up the left of two right-facing dihedrals up to below the Shark's Head, an obvious right-pointing flake 30 feet up.

Struggle over the roof (5.10c/d) then continue more easily up through a 5.8 slot. Angle up and slightly left towards the top, over a couple more 5.10a bulges, to gain a ledge under a right-facing 'V' slot in the final rock band. Hand traverse 15 feet right, then squeeze through the Warm Compress (5.9++) to the summit.\n\nNOTE: on FA, pitch 1 was led (and cleaned of much dirt) with a point of clean aid, freed by second.","protection":"Wires, two or three sets of cams from 1/2 inch to 6 inch.
