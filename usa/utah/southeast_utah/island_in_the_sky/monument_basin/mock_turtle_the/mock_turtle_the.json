The worst mud is on the 1st pitch as is the case generally in Monument Basin. We took belays as the rock dictated (is it sound? and will the belayer be out of the mud fall line?) and wound up using three pitches to make it to the 1st rap anchors instead of 2. After that you get 3 more anchors up to the white sugar capstone.","protection":"We brought a double rack from fingers through 6\" (#6 Camalot). We had to bump #4 and #5 Camalots a bit. A set of nuts is good to have along as well as a nutpick - probably more useful for the leader cleaning mud out from placement slots. We did the 1st 3 raps with a 70m and the last with a 60m+70m. Double 60m would certainly work. Webbing might be good to bring along. We backed up the 1st 3 raps with the last summit register ascent 7 years earlier in 2014.","location":"Look for the obvious wide crack and chimney system on the NW face of the Mock Turtle.
