The rock is much more weathered than Moses, and there are some looser sections.\n\nPitch 1: Climb up ledges to dihedral facing rimrock then climb the offwidth past a bolt to a bolted belay ledge.\n\nVariation: We climbed a difficult offwidth crack to the left leading to the same belay.  Erica pulled a TV-sized block off getting to this offwidth.\n\nPitch 2: Face climb up the ridge past some drilled angles to a belay ledge with bolts.  If you climb the 1st pitch variation you skip this pitch.\n\nPitch 3: A 5.10c move puts you on the ridge which leads up on easier rock past a drilled angle to the \"plank ledge\".\n\nPitch 4: Follow Ridge at 5.6 to the summit.\n\nVariation: From anchors a little below the plank ledge belay, we traversed right and went across a very loose and sandy ramp up to the plank ledge. (not recommended)\n\nDescent: Rappel the route. Note: According to the register, we were the 20th ascent of the tower on Jan 27th 2004.","protection":"1 set of cams, some stoppers, 1 #4.5 Camalot.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,2dfdb657-4194-5c35-8d71-416488c6bbf9,5c6d8ee0-346b-5131-85b0-3ec18ae916a2,d6548e63-84ed-5d53-97e4-3083ac5bb8ee","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Island In The Sky","Taylor Canyon","Aphrodite"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.866,38.305]},"bbox":[-109.8665730182415,38.30455033981814,-109.86542698175853,38.30544966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717268","area_id":"1lSOY4TtXVOX5DCDrFu47g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.8665730182415,38.30455033981814],[-109.86542698175853,38.30455033981814],[-109.86542698175853,38.30544966018186],[-109.8665730182415,38.30544966018186],[-109.8665730182415,38.30455033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.391Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:24.616Z"}
