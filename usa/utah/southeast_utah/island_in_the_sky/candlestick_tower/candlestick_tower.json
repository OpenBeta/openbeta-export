An awkward but brief overhang, and then up a long chimney system to another large ledge. The rock above transitions from Wingate sandstone to the Kayenta, which looks darker and chossier and does not form clean cracks.(5.10)\n\n3. There are (or were, 3 decades ago) a couple of protruding, wedged flake vertical in orientation, maybe 50 feet up. Start just right of this.

Our goal was to find a route that avoided all the loose ledges on the route up.  My old, stretched, double 9mm X 50m ropes didn't really make it to the last ledge on a blank slab.  In the attached sketch, the final two bolt anchor I drilled is out left and up from the fist belay.  I did not mark it because of uncertainty about where it is.","location":"The northeast ridge of Candlestick has a notch formed by a rough spire.
