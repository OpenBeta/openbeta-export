My partner and I were planning on climbing Yesterday's News but started up the wrong route, the climbing was so good that we decided to just continue up it and ended up at the summit having climbed two great tower pitches.\n\nStart with hands in the corner climbing 20 ft to a splitter hand crack, follow this crack system which stays pretty moderate, climbing mostly hands but with interesting features thrown in. You'll reach a section that climbs through a slot, start looking out right for a nice ledge with a drilled-angle anchors. The rock on this pitch is great and climbs really well.\n\nThe second pitch climbs left back into the slot which pinches shut eventually forcing a slight runout to a star drive and fun face climbing at 5.10. The grade eases off and there are several gear placements until reaching a short corner with a finger crack. Pull the corner and you're at the summit.\n\nFeel free to add info if you've got any on this great route.","protection":"A standard rack with a couple extra hand-sized pieces plus a handful of runners should suffice.","location":"Walk to the SW corner of the tower and look for a corner crack with a bolt up and left of it.
