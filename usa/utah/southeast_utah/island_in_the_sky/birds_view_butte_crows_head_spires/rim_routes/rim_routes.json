Some very soft rock exists above the bolt,,, choose the holds wisely. Traverse leftward 15' on an edgy slab to gain good gear. Step up and left to some thin ramping corners then up to a no-hands stance below the STING-IN-THE-TAIL finishing corner above. Arching yellow #2 camalots quickly turn wide in the finishing corner above. Some gracious face holds help here!
