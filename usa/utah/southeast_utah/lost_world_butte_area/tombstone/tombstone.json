Gotto use a lot of different stuff here, including a rotten hook move (reachy spot). Use a big hook. Need lots of slings to lower rope drag. Belay on the summit.This climb was on some of the softest rock we have climbed on in the desert. We drilled a few holes for bolts to catch us if a whole line of thin pins pulled. Unfortuneately the holes collapsed! This left them as dowel holes. Half inch removeable bolts might work in them, but other wise, you need to carry a few 3/8 inch by 2 inch machine bolts to hand place in the holes. Don't pull out! The route could be A2, or it could be A4.
