There is no gear on this pitch and it is very loose. I thought it was about 5.7... though if you had bolts in front of you it might be easier. Watch out for the huge blocks up. There is a good half inch bolt next to a 3/4 inch crack to build an anchor from on the ledge.\n\n60 feet.\n\nPitch 2 = Go up the obvious crack, clipping two fixed pieces at the start to reach the  \"A\"frame. This is actually C1 plugging, but I gave it the \"C2\" cus if the flake shifts you are gonna get an entrada enema. Once through the crux coninue on wider pieces, mostly large hands. This would be good free climbing as the pitch is very solid (above the crux). There is the obligatory wide stuff in the middle and at the end. A good anchor exists at the saddle. 110 feet.\n\nPitch 3 = free climb on very rotten rock to a half inch bolt, then aid/free the remaining 20 feet to the summit on bolts.\n\n40 feet.\n\nRap to the saddle and then to the ground.","protection":"two 60's, doubles on .5 friends to 2.5, then 3 #3, 6 #3.5, 4 #4, 3 #5, 2 #6","location":"Northwest facing corner of the spire."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9c84a21a-9c86-53ad-b063-9b2ddf8eff46,5b13e75c-52dd-54c7-8034-39302fb9bb8f","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Lost World  Butte Area","Grim Reaper, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.9311,38.7052]},"bbox":[-109.93167621137866,38.70475033981813,-109.93052378862136,38.70564966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106191627","area_id":"WxPnXFLdVMeANDkwL7m7jw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:44.361Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:28.740Z"}
