I was amazed to find it unclimbed. I attempted it once, on-sight from the ground, and was able to pull it off my 2nd try a few weeks later, also ground-up. For strong finger crack climbers it would certainly make a reasonable on-sight. I made a plaque, but left off the \"+\" just in case I was super-psyched and it turns out that others think it's easier.","protection":"I used, in order, .75, #4 in an obvious box, 000c3, 00c3, 0c3, green Alien, .3, 3 or 4 .4s in a row, another .3, and a red Alien. There is no anchor. There is an easy scramble to the top, from the left, which can be used to pre-set an anchor if you like. I lowered a loop once on top and hauled up an old #4, new #5, a 1 and a 2. Please do not add bolts for an anchor, and do not top-rope this route with the rope running over the edge. The rock is soft and won't tolerate much wear.","location":"On the West Face, only about 100 yards away from the Tombstone.
