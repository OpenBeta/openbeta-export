First pitch starts on top of two obvious boulders and follows some sandy pockets to the ridge. from here walk along the ridge to gain the start of the Sphinx.","protection":"First pitch is protected by one bolt on the face and one bolt at the top (current as of 11/25/17) use a couple cams to build a three piece anchor just above the single bolt. For some reason these bolts keep getting chopped. from there 5 quick draws will do for the remaining climb","location":"From the parking area head north to find two large boulders in the middle of the ridge. At the start of the third pitch climb the chimney to the east side until you can step back across to the formation proper then continue to the top. From the top head back down to the third pitch belay station and do a 80' rappel back to the ground (twin 60M ropes will get you all the way back down to the parking area without scrambling through the rock bands and sand dunes)"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9c84a21a-9c86-53ad-b063-9b2ddf8eff46,59a66ce7-a74e-5b73-ae10-c7afeb571f99","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Lost World  Butte Area","Sphinx, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.91696,38.68691]},"bbox":[-109.91753606405565,38.68646033981815,-109.91638393594434,38.68735966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113887512","area_id":"WaZs56dOW3OuEMev61cfmQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:43.965Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:38.073Z"}
