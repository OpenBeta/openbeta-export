Walk along a third class ramp, and then enter a heinous bulging 5.8 squeeze chimney.  This thing is not protectable for 20 feet or so without really wide gear of some kind - i left a tipped out 5 camalot at the start of the chimney, though it gets easier towards the top.  Natural belay on a good rubble covered ledge above this.  80' 5.8R C1\n\nP2: Climb up and then straight left with a little downclimbing to a bulging sandy crack.  Pull one hard move and then easy to the anchor.  Route finding is tricky and the rocks sucks on this pitch.  I took a big fall getting off route going up too high too early - don't be suckered by the stopper I left to get off that part after the fall.  100' 5.8R\n\nP3: Really cool pitch.  Climb up to a 4 bolt ladder, and then left up 5.7 munge to the notch.  Mantle onto the ledge and then aid up and right on bolts past an optional intermediate 2 bolt belay to a GORGEOUS splitter on the opposite face of the summit tower.  Climb the incredible thin splitter on small aliens and tcus to a three bolt ladder and then a mantle to the summit.  This pitch is three stars, and makes the first two pitches worth suffering through.  The rope drag can be very bad - if you have any at all at the intermediate belay stop there or prepare to suffer on the topout mantle.  140' 5.7 C1\n\nTo descend, make a double rope rap to the top of the second pitch, and another straight to the ground.  Bring webbing to replace the rap slings, and a register would be nice too.","protection":"10 rivet hangers or wired stoppers, 1 set of stoppers, 3 sets of cams from micro to 2\", 2 sets 2-3\", 1 set 3-12\".  Many 24-48\" slings are very useful for reducing rope drag.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,9c84a21a-9c86-53ad-b063-9b2ddf8eff46,3371e971-acb6-5369-b2e7-2837a2ce63c2","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Lost World  Butte Area","Cenotaph Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.9198,38.6895]},"bbox":[-109.92037608490952,38.689050339818145,-109.91922391509044,38.68994966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717140","area_id":"M3Hpcay2U2my5yg3os5jwg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:44.363Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:28.753Z"}
