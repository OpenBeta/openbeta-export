The remainder of the route is on excellent chocolate varnish. Once past the initial slot follow hands and cups in a left-facing corner to a 15' #5 camalot section immediately followed by a short hands roof. Continue up to the upper slot bulge where the corners change. This is passed via strenuous hands in the back and knee-locks into fists and cups.
