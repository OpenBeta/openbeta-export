Well, this Spring I went through Moab and thought it fitting to try and organize the classic Nate Dogg crew manifestation, choosing this crag as the day's fare. I've always loved getting the gang together, and this was definitely an all-time group. Seeing as how I knew there weren't going to be too many more days when I could do this, I was so psyched to see it pan out.\n\nSam and Carl were there, along with the legendary duo of Charley Graham and Herb Crimp, and two of my other favorites; Joe, and the always-entertaining Trevor. We had PBRs and an awesome day.\n\nThe crack is a typical find that I like; thin fingers and bullet stone. I aided it pretty quickly, was relieved that the banana-shaped block was solid, and drilled the anchor. Being a little out of shape, I didn't even bother TR-ing it. I just kicked back and watched the crew go at it. Of course Herb flashed it on TR so I suggested that he lead it post haste, which he did, dispatching the FFA and rounding out the quick establishment of yet another classic.\n\nI chose the name because this was one of my final days at Indian Creek for what may be some time. Giving this route to Herb was both a testament to our friendship, and an embodiment of all the qualities I love about climbing and the amazing friends I've gotten to share this pursuit with. Oh, and there's also a double entendre regarding the giant block just within reach at the start. ;)","protection":"If I recall correctly it's blue TCUs, BD .3s and .4s, and maybe one piece bigger than that?","location":"Just to the right of Pow Hana"},"__v":0},{"_id":"2WPT0nimVtyzThCqT4ZLxA==","name":"No Ka Oi","yds":"5.11-","grades":{"yds":"5.11-","french":"6c"},"fa":"Jill Barr, Matt Laggis, Jill Barr","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.54931,38.09271]},"left_right_index":8,"mp_id":"121498600","mp_crag_id":"107074434","climb_id":"2WPT0nimVtyzThCqT4ZLxA==","areaRef":"iBjdSC9DVG6lxjJtIKblvA=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the twin cracks with good gear to the next section with very tricky to bad gear, this section is sporty and fun.\n\ncontinue to a thin hands crack to anchor.","protection":".3 to 2  maybe some chocks.","location":"Around the right side of the crag, on top of a ledge that must be scrambled to.
