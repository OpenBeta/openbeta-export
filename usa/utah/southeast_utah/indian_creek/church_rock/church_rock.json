From there, the crack goes through the size range. More of an endurance route than a cruxy one, but the .75 Camalot section is where I was feeling it the most (someone else needs to verify the grade). And just remember, this ain't granite (or Wingate for that matter): sew it up!","protection":"One bolt protects the ramp at the bottom. Triple rack of cams from tips to hands, with one cupped hand and one fist-sized piece. Keep a few small pieces to belay your pard up to the ledge as there are no anchors. We used the rappel \"turtle\" on the north end of the formation to get off (hmmm, interesting indeed), after summiting via the Regular Route.","location":"This is the new route located on the east side of Church Rock. And by new, I mean in the geological sense, as in recent massive rock fall left a clean beautiful dihedral that can't be missed by any circumambulist.

We climbed up the face facing the road, and on the left side.  After a bit of scrambling, you come to a very hueco-covered wall;...ascend this up the the shoulder of the formation.....Scramble around a bit, and find steep crack system (short ) to the summit. The climbing is funky and a bit wierd, and the anchor from the shouder is odd too;....a bunch of tied off dirt mushrooms and one pin in a hole.  It's a novel experience.  I had fun.  I did this climb with Tony Sartin in March of 1993.  Eric's Guidebook doesn't say too much of the climb; everyone sure has seen the formation, but how many have been to the summit?  Take a day off from the punishing splitters and bag a summit....just for kicks.","protection":"A rack of cams should do.  I believe you place cams in heucos at one point?","location":"Intersection of U.S. 191 and State Highway 211."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,f166e672-4a52-56d3-94f1-14c876feb670,613995ed-d911-526d-ad3a-ee9e94837315","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Indian Creek","Church Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.3454,38.0736]},"bbox":[-109.34597120069527,38.07315033981814,-109.34482879930476,38.07404966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105966895","area_id":"YTmV7dkRUm2tOu6elINzFQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:46.976Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:33.450Z"}
