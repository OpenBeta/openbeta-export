Ascend an easy left-facing corner, then tackle a roof on fingers with helpful feet. Continue up the incredible finger crack using face features when available. Eventually the finger crack intersects a wide crack on the right--transition to the wide crack as it pinches down 4'' to 0.5''. The final moves before the anchor may require some off width.","protection":"single rack .4-4, heavy on the .4 with extra .5","location":"This route is located in \"The Cove\" section of the Beach, just left of Rip Curl."},"__v":0},{"_id":"vQaoPbC4WZibdQf5S9sLKA==","name":"AKA Beach Surprise","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.58228,38.16148]},"left_right_index":18,"mp_id":"120532528","mp_crag_id":"116094109","climb_id":"vQaoPbC4WZibdQf5S9sLKA==","areaRef":"cucHdgOkXG+2An3YilbsnA=="},"content":{"description":"I think this would clean up to be a splitter route, but I would describe the current state as a bit 'Desert AF.' I hope more folks climb it which will make it better. There is some loose and low-quality rock, mostly to the left of the splitter, and (as of spring 2021), no chalk but plenty of sand on the route. Belayer needs a helmet, and best not to stand directly under the climber. This route is an enjoyable journey through face climbing, #3 splitter, pods, and a short handcrack to end the saga! Protects well throughout. It's fun and full-value. Do it!!\n\nIt's hard to see the anchors from the ground, but they are right above and to the right of the second pod. Metolius rap bolts.
