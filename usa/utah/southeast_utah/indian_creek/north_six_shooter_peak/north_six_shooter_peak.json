There was no vibram (till we added some ;-) and no other signs, so to the best of our knowledge that was the first ascent  (unless someone climbed it barefoot and without chalk, haha).  So I thought I would go ahead and add a \"new\" route just for fun.  :-)\n\nThe crux is obvious and about 15-20 feet up.  It used to be quite a bit harder.  It was somewhere in the 5.12+ range.  Someone pulled some chockstones out of the crack for footholds.  When first done there was basically nothing for your feet.  Also someone broke a big flake that is a crucial handhold on the left near the crux and it lowered that hold about a foot.  You used to have to more or less \"statically\" dyno to that flake and be careful you didn't break it, haha.\n\nWe watched the guy who broke it (we were above him on our 2nd ascent) and he fell to the ground right in front of his GF, but he was luckily ok.  He didn't have all the super small high tech (read strange) gear we had....not that we tested it out...LOL  It probably would have come out, frankly.\n\nI didn't add pics because that was when we only had film, haha, and I haven't scanned any climbing pics.  I also have camcorder footage, but I have no way to play those old tapes.\n\nIt starts out super duper thin/non-existent and slowly opens up to perfect hands out a roof/overhang then goes to sort of a combination of offwidth/chimney-ish moves with fists in the crack ending in very large fists.  I had to stack my thumb on the end of my fist and do some face moves to get to the ledge.  If you know Rick Westbay and have seen his meathooks, his fists fit perfectly, haha.\n\nIt's an awesome pitch.  It ends on a nice ledge. You can continue to summit by merging with another route right there and go left out those roofs where you can experience big air.","protection":"The bottom isn't protected easily, if at all, and requires the smallest cams or other small high tech gear.

It looks like dirt from far away, but it's actually like a shale, and can be very dangerous.  Rick and I found out the hard way, haha.  We had to do some running dyno jumps to get over/up it.\n\nApproach from the east unless you want to $hit ur pants...haha.

Lightning Bolt Cracks is one of the undisputed must-do ultra-classic desert towers and would be worth doing for the summit alone even if the climbing was total crap. The position rivals the final pitch of the Naked Edge.\n\nThe route can be done in 3 or 4 pitches--many different belays are possible. The various guidebooks (with the exception of Rock Climbing Utah) all have strangely inaccurate route descriptions.\n\nP1-start on the right side of the east face in the beautiful splitter crack (fingers to chimney). The left crack is 5.11+ and also very pretty. I thought the real crux of this pitch was not at the beginning (rated 5.11a), but the overhanging, somewhat difficult to protect moves into the awkward leaning slot (rated variously 5.9 or 5.10) above. There is a questionable small wire left of the slot if you don't have a big cam.\n\nOne can belay directly above the slot (big cam, chockstone) or traverse left at 5.9+ and belay in a V-slot with mediocre rock but a decent stance.\n\nP2-two options-thin 5.11 fingers widening to splitter off-hands over a roof on the right, or 5.9 flared chimney widening to off-fists over a roof on the left. I took the left, which is rated 5.10, although fairly burly by Creek 5.10 standards. You can also start up the left slot and traverse right to the splitter off-hands which apparently is the easiest way to do the pitch.\n\nBelay above the roof if desired (medium-large friends and/or more fixed delectables), or continue up and left (5.10-) in the acute corner to a spectacular belay just under the bombay chimney/roof.\n\nP3-An unnerving spectacle: turn the huge roof (amazingly, only 5.10) into good hand jams; follow the cracks through progressively worse rock to the base of the final chimney. Belay here (small cams needed) or continue into the final squeeze chimney to the summit (rope drag shouldn't be an issue here as you'll be inching your way up anyway). Enjoy one of the best views of your life, then rappel.","protection":"Bring a double set of camming devices from tcus/small aliens to a number four friend. A number four camalot can be useful, and a number five camalot [edit: old size - so now, a number 6] helps in protecting the first pitch slot but plenty of people do the route without it.\n\nThe final squeeze chimney is secure if you can slip deep inside. I've heard that a number four big bro would fit here. Big people will find it easier to climb as an off-width on the outside, but that would be a damn scary way to lead it! There used to be a bolt but it has been pulled.\n\nPlan on setting your own belay anchors or at least backing up the dubious fixed anchors that do exist.
