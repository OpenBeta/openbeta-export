This is one of 8 additions we collectively put up in January. Many thanks to all those involved.\n\nThe route is amazing, and I feel very fortunate to have stumbled upon it. I think it is comparable to Burl Dog in style, quality and difficulty. I would love for some folks to go repeat it, as I think it is one of the better routes I've found and I think it measures up nicely on the tiny crack test-piece circuit.\n\nThe climbing is mostly very thin and the crux is technical lie-backing reminiscent of Burl Dog but just a tad easier I think. I'll let others help level out the grade. There is a good ol' fashioned off-width section after the crux as well that adds to the character, but it has a finger crack barely within reach in the back so big gear is not necessary. One can simply run it out or plug in a finger-sized cam deep in there. Imagine carrying a BD #6 through the crux of Burl Dog and you'll see what I mean about foregoing gear of that size.\n\nAnother note; In the crux it would be difficult to stop and place gear, as you're lie-backing for all you're worth and the crack tapers to next to nothing. Therefor I think it should be said that this route could be considered a little PG-13 for Indian Creek when truly giving it hell. If you blow it making the final moves of the crux you're taking a ride onto some small gear. Proceed accordingly. Someone stronger could likely stop and fiddle in a purple or grey c3, but I think it's wiser to just make a run for the tips crack after placing your last sensibly-sized cams.","protection":"A healthy serving of tiny cams from purple to red c3/green Alien, along with likely three or four pieces in the BD .3 /yellow Alien/.4 range.
