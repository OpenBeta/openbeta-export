From the left, you have Thumbelina, Sparkling Touch, and then Easter Island.  From the road, a careful eye will disern the summit cairn.\n\nBegin right off the trail at an obvious dihedral with a wide crack, and a wide hands crack just to the right.  Climb the wide hands up to a ledge, and make a few exciting and improbable moves right and up to the next ledge system.  Make your way up to the notch, and work out a belay by the unique chockstone bridging the gap.  This pitch is 5.8.\n\nFor P2, get on top of the chockstone and head up the face, following the holds to the right.  You might want a couple finger sized cams to protect getting to the first bolt (which is around the corner), but be careful as some of the blocks on the face are loose.  Follow the five or so bolts to the summit on exciting and slightly sandy face climbing.  Fun route.\n\nFrom the summit, make one double rope rappel, or two single rope rappels to the ground.","protection":"1 set cams, a few extra #3 Camalots for P1.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,f166e672-4a52-56d3-94f1-14c876feb670,47b27797-f7c9-5f85-9a74-688df6b560a6,c8e3c62f-ea89-52b9-8f16-fa234a0318e6","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Indian Creek","Bridger Jacks, The","Easter island"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.60041,38.08824]},"bbox":[-109.60098131506847,38.087790339818135,-109.59983868493153,38.088689660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120540092","area_id":"yOPGL+qJUrmPFvojSgMY5g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.390Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:43.830Z"}
