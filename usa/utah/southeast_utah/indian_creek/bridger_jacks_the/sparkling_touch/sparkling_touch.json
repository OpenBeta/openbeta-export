Look for a thin hand to a zig-zag offwidth.  The first pitch goes up a hand to an offwidth crack, over a bulge with cool liebacks using two cracks to a bolted belay. The second pitch goes up a short, thin crack to easier climbing to another bolted belay.  Both pitches are 5.10.  The last pitch goes past a bolt above the belay through some hard, bouldery 5.11 moves to a subsidary summit and another bolt.  Lean across the gap between this summit and the true summit to a crack, then left to the belay and the top.  Don't forget to sign the summit register.  One single rap down this pitch, then it is possible to make a double rope rap with 200 foot ropes to the ground.","protection":"Cams of all sizes.  It is easy to string the first two pitches together.  I used up to a #4 Camalot on the first pitch, and a #3.5 Camalot is also helpful.  Also bring some small cams and at least doubles of hand sized pieces.  Bring two #2 and a #3 Camalots for the last pitch an a couple quickdraws.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,f166e672-4a52-56d3-94f1-14c876feb670,47b27797-f7c9-5f85-9a74-688df6b560a6,b7aee796-a5c6-565f-988e-b0927812a4ef","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Indian Creek","Bridger Jacks, The","Sparkling Touch"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.60041,38.08824]},"bbox":[-109.60098131506847,38.087790339818135,-109.59983868493153,38.088689660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120540076","area_id":"t67nlqXGVl+YjrCSeBKk7w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.60098131506847,38.087790339818135],[-109.59983868493153,38.087790339818135],[-109.59983868493153,38.088689660181856],[-109.60098131506847,38.088689660181856],[-109.60098131506847,38.087790339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:47.388Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:25.235Z"}
