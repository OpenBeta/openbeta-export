Creek is a crack climbing mecca in the southeastern region of Utah, USA. Located within the [Bears Ears National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bears_Ears_National_Monument) this place is widely recognized for its stunning orange sandstone cliffs, splitter crack climbing routes, and beautiful desert scenery.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of rock climbing in Indian Creek is that the difficulty level can be highly subjective and varies from person to person depending your hand and finger size.  Some climbers can casually cruise up a 1-inch (2.5cm) crack, while others struggle like a cat in a bathtub.\n\nAs one of the most popular rock climbing destinations in the world, Indian Creek is a fragile land that requires careful stewardship from climbers to ensure its preservation for future generations.\n\nClimbers who visit Indian Creek are encouraged to practice Leave No Trace principles, which include packing out all trash and only use designated toilets.\n\nAdditionally, climbers are encouraged to follow established trails and avoid creating new ones to protect the delicate desert vegetation and [cryptobiotic soil](https://www.nps.gov/glca/learn/nature/soils.htm).\n\n## Guidebooks:\n\n- Indian Creek: A Climbing Guide by David Bloom"},"density":2.106168061671424,"totalClimbs":1501,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:45.457Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:47:11.007Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"641b1fbbf0687d6d493b8818","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"updatedBy":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw=="}
