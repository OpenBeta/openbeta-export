However, if one were to stay left as indicated on Green's topo, it turns into a chimney with an overhung block at the top.  That chimney might take a #6 cam for the first 12 feet or so, but then it appears unprotectable for another ~25 feet to the underside of the block.  Conversely, Green's narrative describes pitch 1 as \"Jam flare with hand crack in it to ledge below notch.\"  Has the route changed; it could be possible that the giant block shifted and the hand crack disappeared?  Is the original topo wrong?  Did I miss something?\n\nRegardless, the start of this route, up the left side, presents a superb alternate start to the South Face Right by avoiding that route's loose flakes on the right.
