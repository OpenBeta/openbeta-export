Gear belay on a ledge to the left of a bolted anchor (rap anchor) because it is more comfy and convenient. 5.11\n\n3rd class and hiking to the top. We belayed the first bit on the way up and down because it is that creepy ball-bearing mossback shit like on the approach to Castleton. It feels like it could zip you right over the edge!\n\nThree double roped raps get you down. Two of the anchors have webbing (something I regret) so you may want to bring some replacement webbing (or better yet, chains!)\n\nAs far as tower routes go, this one is pretty good. Maybe a small notch below Rimshot on Bridger Jack in quality. But keep in mind, it has only been done once and IS a tower route, so be ready for a little junk. The setting is pristine, however.","protection":"Pretty standard tower rack to #4 Camalot, plus we used an old #5 Camalot.","location":"This route is on the north face (facing Davis Canyon) just right of the center of the wall. There are two larger corners that face opposite directions and form sort of a wide buttress at the tallest part of the wall--pretty clearly visible from the road. The route is just right of the right corner. Look for the first anchor about 80 feet up. I can't remember if we made a plaque, but I don't think so. Just approach from the Davis Canyon road, whichever way looks expedient. There is actually a USGS marker at the base of the wall.
