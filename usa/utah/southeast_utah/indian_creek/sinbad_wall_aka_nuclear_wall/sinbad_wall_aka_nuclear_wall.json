Its awkward, its dirty, you wiggle and squirm, its soft, but now you're on top. You feel empty, you wish there was more, you wish it was better, but this is the end, and you're never going back. It's time to part ways but there's no bolts, there's no easy way down, the climb is keeping you and it's ruining the experience.","protection":"Big Cam -> Small cam in the horizontal -> Deathblocks -> bd .75 in choss\n\nLotta soft rock, bd 6 aint gonna cut it, traverse to different anchors.","location":"Right of Hot Sex"},"__v":0},{"_id":"6R0i2rkfVTqPliTVrPeMLQ==","name":"The Big \"O\"","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Kat Whipple","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.55072,38.04694]},"left_right_index":18,"mp_id":"107619499","mp_crag_id":"106950427","climb_id":"6R0i2rkfVTqPliTVrPeMLQ==","areaRef":"rsP4Mfe1Uw+P+liaALhQtA=="},"content":{"description":"Squeeze your way past a bolt at 3/4 height to the anchors on top of the pillar.","protection":"Green C3, #1 C4, Red C3, 2 Blue big bros and bolt.

I could make out something like: Actor Reactor or Act or React..\n\nExcellent hand crack with powerful and steep start. Difficulties drop considerably afterwards with cruiser hands, big feet holds, and a couple of pods. Decent warm-up after the initial bulge. Anchors are set a bit far back on the ledge. Easy enough to hang a TR on Violater to the right from this ledge.\n\nBeware of how/where you place cams after the bulge. There is a stuck #2 like 4 ft back in the crack that most likely got pushed back by the rope due to the angle change.
