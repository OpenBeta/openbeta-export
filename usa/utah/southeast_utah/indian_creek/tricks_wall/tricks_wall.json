Run 4 laps back to back on Slice and Dice and you'll probably be ready...\n\nBring all your green Camalots, and probably all your buddies too.\n\nTricks starts in a right facing corner with thin fingers opening to thin hands at a little ledge where you can milk a little rest before the business. From here set sail into a semmingly endless section of ring locks thru 2 overlaps until it drops to rattly fingers towards the top. Hold your shit together and juice your way to the anchors. Placing gear definitely adds difficulty so trim down that rack and stretch it out!\n\nAn extension continues another 50(?) feet at a similar size. Not sure what this would do to the grade.","protection":"My rack was: (BD sizes)\n\nBlue metolius\n\n0.3\n\n2x 0.4\n\n4x 0.5\n\n1 red metolius\n\n#1\n\n2x #2\n\n7x 0.75\n\nYou may want more 0.75 and 0.5 for a first burn.\n\nRopes:\n\n2 60M\n\nWe did stretch an 80M but both ends were about 6' off the ground so watch out!","location":"Cant miss it.
