Be warned: the only bolts you'll be clipping are star drives.\n\nP1: A short 5.6 flake. No anchor\n\nP2: run-out face past bolts+thin wires. 5.10\n\nP3: More slab.\n\nWith traffic and brushing, this could be a decent route and a pleasant alternative to single-pitch splitters. But the ASCA could put this route on the short-list for achor replacement. I'm adding the route to this database more to dissuade climbers until the bolts are replaced. Be solid at the grade!\n\n(editor's note: there were two submittals for this route.  here is the following description from the later entry for this route, by Luke Mehall on 8/2/15)\n\n\"The Bow\" is one of the most anti-Indian Creek style routes in Indian Creek. Located between Blue Gramma and the Super Crack Buttress it's a two pitch slab route, established by Ed Webster and company (I believe).\n\nThe route is in the process of being re-equipped, the first four bolts are new bomber 1/2 inchers, provided by the ASCA, and the rest of the route has old 1/4 inch bolts. We got scared and ran out of time in the spring, so we're waiting until the fall to finish the job.\n\nEven when the bolts are bomber this is going to be a heady ride. The climbing feels like 5.11 slab and it really makes you ponder that this thing was probably put up before sticky rubber existed!","protection":"some small - medium sized pieces for the initial crack. Plus quickdraws.","location":"Starts up a slabby, dirty crack to a line up bolts up the slab. At the moment the route is very unsafe, and a re-bolting effort is in progress."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,f166e672-4a52-56d3-94f1-14c876feb670,80f6ee58-c5d6-5da6-a246-57f8cdd15b19","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Indian Creek","Orion's Bow"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.54,38.0258]},"bbox":[-109.5405708278416,38.02535033981813,-109.53942917215842,38.02624966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110835100","area_id":"gPbuWMXWXaaiRlf4zdFbGQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.5405708278416,38.02535033981813],[-109.53942917215842,38.02535033981813],[-109.53942917215842,38.02624966018186],[-109.5405708278416,38.02624966018186],[-109.5405708278416,38.02535033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:46.969Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:41:00.896Z"}
