We all agreed on mid 5.10, but never thought to name it; the name I have assigned it here is our last initials. We believed this to be an FA at the time mostly because of the amount of loose rock that was cleared in the process, and the fact that the rope left an unavoidable groove where the climb changed direction, which had not been evident before.  The base area also required a fair amount of 'tidying' to allow for any kind of rope management.\n\nThis is being reported only now, some 36 years later, (guess I've been busy) because I just rediscovered these old crappy scans from slides.","protection":"Thin to med cams.","location":"From the large boulder in the middle of Fringe of Death Canyon, this climb was uphill to the left as you face into the canyon.
