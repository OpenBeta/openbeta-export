There is a little ledge here deep in a cleft that is at the base of a short OW that is the saddle between the tower and the main wall behind. There is a direct line that might be the better option to this point. Matt thought it would go at 5.9. From here continue up the flared OW into the chimney and continue placing some random cams along the way (.5, .4, .75). Stem up until you can reach the first of two bolts. 5.5 takes you from the bolts to the top. The anchor is on the NW side of the tower.  Divide the route into pitches as you see fit.
