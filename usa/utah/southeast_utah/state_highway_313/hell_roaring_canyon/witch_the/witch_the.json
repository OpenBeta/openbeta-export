All four pitches are engaging.  The crux is hard and spooky but can be aided.\n\nPitch One   Climb the obvious crack up a shallow right facing corner to a few moves on dubious rock through a horizontal band and a two piton anchor. 5.10\n\nPitch Two  Ascend the beautiful corner above the belay. 5.11 R\n\nPitch Three  Climb past a couple angles to a corner and then make some awkward moves left under a large flake. The RC Utah book says to avoid this way as there is a death flake but I didnt find it that scary so perhaps there was another flake that has fallen. To avoid the flake the book says to face climb left at 5.9+ to a corner that is followed to the anchor. 5.10\n\nPitch Four  Face climb past several angles to the summit. 5.9\n\nRappel from the summit to the top of the third pitch and then to the top of the first pitch.","protection":"A double set of cams to #3 Camalot with many extras from Black Alien to .4 Camalot.
