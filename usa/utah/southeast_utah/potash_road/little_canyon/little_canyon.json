The route is undoubtedly very sandy and flaky, but the shape of the features are so unique that it really doesn't matter. The second pitch is so out of this world weird, you gotta do it.\n\nP1. 5.8\n\nScramble up a ramp and pull one move to a belay. This pitch was fine as a solo, just be attentive of the fluffy rock.\n\nP2. 5.11?\n\nFreakin cool pitch. Very WTF. Pull into a 25' horizontal half-pipe tunnel traverse with a crack in the bottom. Are you climbing, or are you spelunking? Is it 5.7 or 5.12? who knows... Once you emerge, continue up a flared chimney with some micros or ball-nuts for pro in a calcite crack. Gear to 4\"\n\nP3. 5.11-\n\nFace climb up some crumbling sandstone past a few bolts to reach the chimney. Climb gently! I used a Kong Panic to help clip the first bolt off the belay. Continue up the solid, yet runnout chimney to a natural thread and some gear as the chimney pinches you out into standard offwidth.","protection":"Gear .1-9\"","location":"Cross under the road in the culvert to prevent some bushwacking.
