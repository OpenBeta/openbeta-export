Then climb the first tier of the roof through a thin hands slot to some huge jugs.  Then climb the next 10 foot roof with fists to a 5.10 offwidth above. The belay is bolted.  5.11\n\nP2- Climb a 5.10 offwidth/squeeze through a weird loose flake.  After the flake the crack splits.  Go left to a small ledge.  Climb up and left from there through some very scary loose rock to an unprotected 5.8 corner above to a two bolt belay on a big ledge just below the summit.\n\nScramble to the summit and downclimb (one hard move off the ledge.\n\nDescent- Rappel the route in one 60 meter rappel or two shorter ones.\n\nThis route has a few sections of really bad rock, but for the most part is excellent.
