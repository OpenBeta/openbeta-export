Start up the WIDE crack, using a couple delicate face holds, transferring left into the cupped hands crack after several moves. This is preferred over the direct start due to rock quality issues in the first 10 feet. Climb the continually widening crack until the crack ends, and make a couple of stemming moves to move past this crackless section, into the right facing dihedral above. Continue up the dihedral until reaching the anchors above.","protection":"A double rack from Yellow Metolius to #4, with a couple extra pieces in the #0.75 to #1 range.
