Stopping at the anchor below the roof keeps the first pitch at 5.11 or avoid the hanging belay and traverse out left fighting around the lip of the roof (crux), then up easier terrain to another bolted anchor.

This anchor is shared with the second pitch of Quantum of Solace. (11-)\n\nPitch three starts with steep thin hands in a corner to an anchor out left.  Pass the anchor and continue left through some hard underclings to a big move that gets you into a corner with a bolt.  Blindly move out of the corner and around the arÃªte to your left to get to the belay.
