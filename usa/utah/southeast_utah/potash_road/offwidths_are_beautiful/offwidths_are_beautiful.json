Fun and varied right facing offwidth. Stack, chicken wing & squeeze if you can up to a fixed pin then launch into a squeeze chimney that will squeeze you back and eventually force you to crush some more offwidth (blue big bros or a #9 valley giant helps make this less of a religious experience) #6 Camalots are good to have but useless up high. This has been called 5.10 but I would add a few +'s unless you are a 7 year old or Craig Luebben. 2 bolt belay with rap rings in chimney. 5.10\n\nPitch 2. Chimney between the pillar and the main wall. The Karl Kelly book says that there is \"no worthwhile pro\" and I would agree.
