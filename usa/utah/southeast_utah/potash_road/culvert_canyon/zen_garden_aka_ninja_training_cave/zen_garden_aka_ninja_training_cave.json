Zach Smith, who developed the area, found a gem with this line.\n\nIf you're looking into the cave this line starts matched on a  crimp rail about 15' right of Zen Garden.  Easier yet, look for the obvious three finger pocket and follow it back to its obvious starting point.\n\nClimb perfect horizontal edges to a long move to the pocket, and don't let the feet cut as you go for a jug (crux).  Follow jugs to crimps on the headwall and committing moves on slopers for the top out (brush them first).  The exit moves are made extra exciting as you find yourself higher and higher off the ground and above a tree.  Lots of pads and spotters recommended for the top out.","protection":"If you're doin the OG top out you'll be doing some dynamic moves right above a tree so watch out.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"kb2QRICVVom0ApiP/PuGYg==","name":"China Buffet","yds":"V6","grades":{"yds":"V6","font":"7A","vscale":"V6"},"fa":"Zach","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.63587,38.58167]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"117994098","mp_crag_id":"110118471","climb_id":"kb2QRICVVom0ApiP/PuGYg==","areaRef":"VE7LD1YxWDeUS3NCXtVwZw=="},"content":{"description":"Squat start on a jug, then go up and left out the cave (perfect crimps!), eventually traversing the lip of the roof to a jug, then up the face on slooopey pockets (crux).","protection":"At least a couple of pads","location":"Far right side of the cave"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,27051d4b-092e-56bb-9bb4-9aea5cdf319c,f17953a3-08e0-5c8d-a174-5bcf98fbaa16,544ecb0f-5631-5837-944b-73425ed57067","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Potash Road","Culvert Canyon","Zen Garden aka Ninja Training Cave"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V10"},{"count":1,"label":"V8"},{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":3}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":3}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.63587,38.58167]},"bbox":[-109.63644521896394,38.581220339818145,-109.6352947810361,38.582119660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110118471","area_id":"VE7LD1YxWDeUS3NCXtVwZw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.63644521896394,38.581220339818145],[-109.6352947810361,38.581220339818145],[-109.6352947810361,38.582119660181874],[-109.63644521896394,38.582119660181874],[-109.63644521896394,38.581220339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:44.380Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:57.292Z"}
