I doubt this splitter has eva peeped an ascent wit tha amount of sand n' loose shiznit I was able to clean out. The bottom is poor rock quality but the upper varnished section is better, I cleaned most of what I could on lead and then rapping back off so it's ready to go, rip a lap, fun one.","protection":"A blue and/or orange TCU will protect moves up to the roof.\n\nA medium chock for the roof, I brought a #2 UFO (OG Czech gear for that soft rock you know?)\n\nOff fingers - big hands.
