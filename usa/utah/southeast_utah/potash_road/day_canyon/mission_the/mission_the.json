A bit awkward but fun. Belay at the fixed anchors on the ledge.\n\nP2 is the business. Do some face moves with a bolt protecting you (5.11) to the splitter. The crack starts as a good hands, then goes to cupped hands, then fists, and then at the dogleg it turns to 5 inches of OW that holds steady for 80 feet. The crux is getting out of the bombay chimney/pod and back into the offwidth. (You might want a #2 bigbro for this. The #5 friend fits perfect, but if you leave it there it will get pulled deep into the crack.) I fell on this move, but got it. Josh fired it. Its a lot easier if you can take off your helmet and don't have a huge rack of superfluous pieces (like 5 of each under 2.5... which got no use on this climb!) Continue on 5.10 ow for another 50 feet or so to the large ledge. An anchor here can take hand size pieces and a couple of 1.5's if you have them.\n\nP3 follow the obvious 5.8 chimney and face holds to the summit. There are two summits... the north one being higher but the south one having the rappel.\n\nRap the route in two legs","protection":"Hands to #6 friends. I'd recommend triple 2.5-4 friends, then 4 or 5 #5 friends and a #2 bigbro. A #6 is not neccessary if you have that and is really slightly too big. A few slings, and one quickdraw for the bolt. A 1.5 is handy at the second ledge.\n\nYou need two sixties to get down.","location":"The Mission is at the very top of Day Canyon. \"Stick to the Mission\" is on the southwest face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,27051d4b-092e-56bb-9bb4-9aea5cdf319c,bde64a1b-a5d2-5edf-b32a-d5430b09868b,82051df8-5035-5f55-9a50-85da9161275f","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Potash Road","Day Canyon","Mission, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.66167,38.56973]},"bbox":[-109.66224512336314,38.56928033981815,-109.66109487663685,38.570179660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105884167","area_id":"ggUd+FA1X1WaUIXakWEnXw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.66224512336314,38.56928033981815],[-109.66109487663685,38.56928033981815],[-109.66109487663685,38.570179660181864],[-109.66224512336314,38.570179660181864],[-109.66224512336314,38.56928033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:45.026Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:18.866Z"}
