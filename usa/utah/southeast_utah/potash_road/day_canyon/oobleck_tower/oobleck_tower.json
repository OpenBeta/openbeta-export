Do a boulder problem to get into the crack then ascend, using hand jams and wrestling moves, for 180 feet to a ledge.. Its pretty soft.\n\nP2 climb a little ways down a slab so that you can reach the left crack, then go up the crack (even softer) on some manky pro. If you maxed out on 5.10, you don't want this pitch, but its no harder than that... you just need to have a little extra power In case something important fails and your suddenly on your arms.\n\nIts over pretty quick and your on the summit.\n\nRap the route... and watch for inexplicable sharp edges. We ruined a rope on the big rap and have no idea how as its a very innocuous looking descent.","protection":"Lots of hand and wide hand gear. I'd take triples or quadruples on 2.5-3.5, then a couple 4's and maybe a 5. Really small aliens, or a pin (L.A.), will help with the boulder problem start. The long pitch is really long, so plan on hand pieces at your own spacing.\n\nThe rap anchors double 1/2 inch bolts.","location":"The route is on the northeast side of Oobleck Tower."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,27051d4b-092e-56bb-9bb4-9aea5cdf319c,bde64a1b-a5d2-5edf-b32a-d5430b09868b,33e1e2dc-70a5-59c3-bc11-355d20bd70ac","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Potash Road","Day Canyon","Oobleck Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.66167,38.56973]},"bbox":[-109.66224512336314,38.56928033981815,-109.66109487663685,38.570179660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105885864","area_id":"M+Hi3HClWcO8ETVdIL1wrA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:45.026Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:29.694Z"}
