SIC FUN!   Note: there's a nice crack in the back of the chimney (on raptor) that, as of now, is up for grabs. Note #2. a word on the rating. were gona need a consensus. in the end we went with 10-. i'd rather it be an easy 10- than a sandbag 5.9. we don't think the moves are harder than 5.9, but there's a bunch of em and we were tired. also; technically the FFA is still up for grabs.  cleanest ascent we got was on the follow (ie; TR). in any case; this is an excellent chimney!!!","protection":"15 quickdraws and one #3 1/2 friend","location":"easy to find. raptor is the very obvious large tower on the left side, about 20 minutes up the canyon.
