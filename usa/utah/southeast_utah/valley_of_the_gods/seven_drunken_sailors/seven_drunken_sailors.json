The rock isn't bad.  The second pitch is the hoot!  The stronger (arms) climber must mount the shoulders of the second in order to gain purchase above a loose overhang.  Two moves and it's over, no protection required, just balls (sorry ladies, I should have used the term \"nads\" which is an abbreviation for gonads which you ladies do have)! Then the leader must hoist a bit to get the second over the hump enough to gain purchase and make those two moves.  Different, but fun!
