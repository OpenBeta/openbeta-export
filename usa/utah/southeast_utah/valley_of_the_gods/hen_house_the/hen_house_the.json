This is the first recorded route on the butte.\n\nP1-Traverse in from the right on a ledge to the base of a splitter. Start with a bouldery crux, up a steep, splitter baggy fingercrack on good rock (has calcite in the crack, the only time I've seen this in the VOG); make wide stems to a corner to the left, until you are forced to bust a couple of splitter moves into an acute flare where the crack widens to thin hands. A small pedestal ledge sits below the easier final corner/flare which has a large, hollow flake that facilitates progress and affords plenty of slightly skeptical gear. A softer finish with some loose plates gets you to a huge midway ledge and a pair of cold shuts. (5.11-, 80)\n\nP2-Scramble from the anchor up a couple of steps to the base of a left facing corner that switches to a right-facing corner after about 15'; this corner sits about 10' left of a major chimney/cleft. The corner starts with a short stretch of steep, tight hands before ramping out and widening through cups to a stance. It would be possible to bail right into the main chimney here and make the pitch easier, but we continued straight up. From the stance, a very tight squeeze widens into a better size, before pinching down and forcing a crux exit into a steep handcrack. Step right into the major chimney system on a convenient chockstone, and finish up this very fun, moderate chimney with featured rock and a good crack on the interior. Belay off of a chain/cold shut anchor on a ledge just below the summit plateau. (5.10+, 110')\n\nScramble up slots and a 40' easy fifth class pitch to the summit. There are several summits, all nearly the same height. We scrambled up a couple of those closest to the topout of the route, and left a cairn with a register on the one we thought might be the highest.\n\nRap the route with one rope (60m fine).","protection":"(1x) .2-.4 (2x).5-2 (1x) 3-6 BD C4 sizes.
