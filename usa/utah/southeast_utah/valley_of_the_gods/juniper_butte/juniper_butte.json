This was the first known route on the butte.\n\nP1-Start up a short band of loose rock, enter the clean, slabby corner that starts off-finger and widens through fists, end on a large ledge. Make a gear belay from good cracks with finger-hand sizes. (5.9, 70')\n\nP2-Move right 15' and head up a short handcrack in a corner with unique pockets on the left wall. This ends in a short loose bit immediately below the expansive summit plateau. Rig a gear belay. There are twin cold shuts for a rappel anchor just left (southwest) of where the pitch tops out. (5.8, 30')\n\nHike west a ways over slabs and slots to the high point (hard to really discern). We left a register in a cairn at what we figured was the highest spot. The summit plateau is a cool spot to ramble around a bit.","protection":"(1x) .2-.4 (2x) .5-3 (1x) 4 BD C4 sizes, cold shut rap anchor on summit. 1 60m rope adequate.","location":"A clean corner just a bit right (northeast) of the center of the southeast (roadside) face.
