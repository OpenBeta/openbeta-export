The bolts with rivet hangers on them will be obvious on the summit block.\n\nP2: Climb up to the base of the 3 bolt, bolt ladder.  Do a couple free moves up and right off the last bolt to a 3 bolt anchor on the summit.\n\nOne long rappel down the west side will get you to the ground.","protection":"If you climb the first pitch we did I would take a single set from .3-3 camalot plus two #4 and a #5.
