It consists of two short pitches separated by a massive ledge system.\n\nP1--Start up a short OW to squeeze to a stance, follow an OW to hand crack in a dihedral to an awkward mantle onto the large, rubble-strewn ledge. The rock is decent, but there are some hollow chunks to beware of. There are two drilled pins on a boulder about 20' back on the ledge for an anchor. (5.8, 70')\n\nP2--Scramble up to the ledge beneath the steep headwall. Start up an overhanging, clean crack in a shallow, right-facing corner that starts as .75 and widens as it rolls over onto the vertical face. Exit the crack after about 25' and diagonal left on a ladder of closely spaced, good drilled pins and bolts to a belay ledge. There are around 10-12 bolts/pins. The anchor situation on the ledge is bizarre, consisting of 3-4 widely spaced bolts on the horizontal surface. (C1, 80')\n\nTraverse the ledge left (east) for about 25' and up a short, easy corner to the summit plateau. This final bit is exposed easy 5th class, and probably best to rope up even though pro is sparse, and there is little for an anchor at the topout.\n\nThe summit rappel anchor is on the far west end, and has good bolts with webbing. Rap the route twice with a single 60m rope.","protection":"(1x) .3-.5 (2x) .75-3 (1x) 4-5 BD C4 sizes, jumars, etriers, replacement webbing for fixed anchors.","location":"Ascends the NW prow.
