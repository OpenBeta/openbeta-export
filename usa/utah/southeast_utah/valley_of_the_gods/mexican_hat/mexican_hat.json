One is a bolt ladder, but the original route is natural without bolts.   Scramble up to the base of the hat and aid out the roof.  It is a short 30-40 foot pitch.  The nailing is quite scary though as you are hanging straight down on knifeblades nailed in thin flakes.  Near the lip of the roof the crack is very flaring and continues to be difficult until you reach the lip and are able to free climb the last few feet onto the flat summit.   Super fun, short and just something to do if you are travelling through that area.","protection":"Pins, cams and stoppers","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,da1bddad-c41e-5788-a197-afb2b978d20a,de28e406-2d80-590c-b82f-a43b0ccef88a","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Valley of the Gods","Mexican Hat"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.84891,37.17362]},"bbox":[-109.8494743267487,37.17317033981814,-109.84834567325132,37.174069660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105716934","area_id":"3ijkBi2AWQy4L6Q7DM74ig==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.8494743267487,37.17317033981814],[-109.84834567325132,37.17317033981814],[-109.84834567325132,37.174069660181864],[-109.8494743267487,37.174069660181864],[-109.8494743267487,37.17317033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:22.590Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:26.888Z"}
