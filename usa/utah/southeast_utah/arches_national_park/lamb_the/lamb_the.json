Climb up the slabby sandy loose corner until you can cut right on a ledge to access the crack system on The Lamb.  Place some small cams and start up the crack that quickly widens to hands, pass a small roof and a OW pod.  Above the pod is some less straight forward climbing and a traverse left over a solid block to the belay.\n\nFrom the belay climb 15' up the obvious OW/chimney and scramble to the summit.  Down climb to the anchor.  A spotter is nice.","protection":"Everything from tiny to a new #5 camalot. A few extra #2 and #3 camalots might be useful.  One 60 meter rope is enough to get down. Anchor consists of 2 bomber drilled pins.
