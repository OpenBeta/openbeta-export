Don't know what the current choss factor is like, but be careful.\n\nThis route is fun and often windy. Fresh snow can make topping out the final moves a little scary, so avoid that situation of possible, but I guess that goes for many routes!\n\nThe climbing is fairly easy (at A0) and fairly well protected to a chimney. Climb the chimney and belay here or keep climbing to the summit with extra rope drag.\n\nSummit moves: Climb a fairly well spaced bolt ladder to top by aid or free climbing at 5.11.  Slightly heady above bolts.\n\nSummary: Go out and have some fun, mostly easy climbing, easy summit, good view.","protection":"One set of friends and stoppers.
