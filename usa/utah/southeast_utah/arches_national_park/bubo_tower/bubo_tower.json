Much to my surprise, my partner followed at great speed as he got to the top- with hands on one side and feet on the other- walking up that way.  Of course, placing gear like this would be no fun.\n\nThe route was originally 3 pitches.  Given the little amount of gear and shortness of the climb, doing it in a single pitch as we did seemed much better.\n\nRap from anchors on the top via 2 ropes (50M will do). A single 70M might get you down. The condition of the webbing on the anchors up top is unknown. It was total crap when I did the climb and I replaced them, but that has been 7 years of desert sun and wind atop a tower.\n\nAs always when doing towers, take some new red/brown webbing just in case.","protection":"Not much for pro.  You can get a few large cams here and there, and a few smaller pieces in cracks in the side walls.  The best plan is to take a light rack + a few big pieces and plan on running it out a little.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,1c74163a-11fa-52d2-9377-7a3171ec97f4,a84f393f-87ed-5397-9e54-bdd8457fa573","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Arches National Park","Bubo Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.59939,38.6242]},"bbox":[-109.5999655599532,38.623750339818145,-109.59881444004681,38.624649660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105717057","area_id":"qE85P4ftU5eeVL3YRX+lcw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:58.316Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:48.753Z"}
