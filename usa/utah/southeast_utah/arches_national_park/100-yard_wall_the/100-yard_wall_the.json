It begins with a wide section down low and gets a little thinner the higher you go, there's quite a few holds on the wall and the flake that make the upward movement much easier. It gets wide again at the top, but with a little less quality rock on the flake. Clip a set of drilled angle anchors and stand on top of the flake and soak up the view of Arches! You can rap back down the flake, but make sure and give your rope a good tug to not get caught in the crack. (People have rapped over the front of the flake, but it puts rope grooves in the flake.)Desert Rock I gives a good description of the climb except where it says to downclimb the route. It has anchors and is easy to rap","protection":"A single set of cams should suffice with a larger one (5\") down low. A couple of 2' slings to get rid of any rope drag and Quickdraws for the anchor.","location":"If you're looking at The 100-yard Wall, this route is on the next level up with The Doil. The Doil looks like a KFC drumstick standing on it's end and to the left about 50 yards are three small flake/towers leaning against the wall. Fledgling is the middle tower and is on the left side of the flake.
