Hike on slickrock and small washes to a slab with two bolts at the top.  This slab is located west of the saddle between the Ham and the summit.\n\nClimb the slab to the two bolts, 20 feet of 5.3.  Once at the top, traverse on a grassy ledge east to a easy class 3 crack which takes you to a short class 4 slickrock ramp 100 yards east of the saddle.  At the top of the class 4 slickrock ramp, walk on a slickrock ledge west to a crack just below the saddle.\n\nPitch 1.  15 feet.\n\nFrom the crack just below the saddle, climb up narrow body crack to the saddle, 5.8+.  This is the crux.\n\nPitch 2.  160 feet.\n\nBelay from the saddle and climb up a slickrock ridge, 5.0-3rd class to a 5.4 crack on the north side of the ridge.  At the top of the 5.4 crack, regain the ridge proper to a headwall.  Belay from the headwall.\n\nPitch 3.  90 feet.\n\nFrom the top of the headwall, move south to a ledge with a large boulder.  Belay from the Boulder, and climb up a very sandy unprotected crack, 5.8, to a slickrock ledge.  From the ledge, climb the prominent chimney to a large block at the top, 5.6.   At the top of pitch 3, it is a short class 3 scramble to the summit.\n\nDescent:\n\nDouble 60 M rope rappel to the north from the boulder at the top of pitch 3.  Watch the pull as there is a crack that would love to eat a knotted rope.  Pull hard left.\n\nThe top of the rappel deposits you on the top of class 4 slab.","protection":"Set of cams and nuts.
