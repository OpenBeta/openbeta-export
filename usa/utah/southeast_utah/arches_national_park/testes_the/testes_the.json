It is actually I 5.9.  (Although I'm sure you could aid off the drilled angle and call it A1+ if you wish.).  When we did the climb, there was a drilled hole for a piton (which was missing)and that was the aid move.  We inserted a piton in the hole (and left it ), free climbing past it (At 5.9), and went to the summit.  It's a summit, an easy tick, and fun enough.
