Continue up until the crack completely seams out. Place gear far above you with a stick clip. Batman up to good placements and low angle rock. The crack eventually widens after some junk rock and then tapers back down with expanding rock panels on the left. Shed a tear as you pass a hammered flush Star drive, and continue up the expando corner to another stick clip cam placement.  Eventually you can step right to a ledge with an anchor.  30 m. 5.8 C4\n\nP2:\n\nA finger crack leads to a wide pod up and left. From the top of the wide pod, stick clip the first of four Star drives up and right that lead to a bedding seam.

Youve got your poorly protected slab climbing right off the ground theres the thin aid in soft rock above a hard ledge some chimneying and offwidth of course a beautiful hand crack some scary face moves and a good old fashion roped-up crawl.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nPitch 1. The first pitch is missing some of the original pitons and thus is somewhat runout and dangerous. Begin with gritty slab climbing up and left across huecos to a new bolt. Commit to the moves above and follow a shallow corner to an old stardrive. This is pretty spooky because if you blow it badly, there is a chance you could ground out. A long stick clip will help prevent this. 5.9R\n\nPitch 2. A few moves on fixed gear accesses the obvious splitter above which goes from black alien to offwidth. This is the money pitch of the route but again, the gear in the beginning is not inspiring and youre looking down at a big belay ledge. Think light the rock is pretty soft here. Belay from a fixed anchor at the top of the crack. (We fixed our rope to this anchor for the seconds to jug and then climbed up another 20 feet to a more comfortable ledge where we built a reasonably solid anchor) 5.10, C2 (or C2)\n\nPitch 3. A boulder problem not far above the belay leads to a short, bolt protected chimney. Belay at the top of the chimney from gear. 5.10\n\nPitch 4. Traverse left on bolts to a short, funky chimney and follow this to a huge ledge. Belay from gear or climb on top of the pillar you were chimneying behind and clip in long to the rappel bolts. 5.9 C1\n\nPitch 5. We walked left along a large ledge and with a bit of exposed crawling and easy chimneying, we made the summit. When we looked at the book later we realized that we were supposed to go right on the big ledge. The book calls it Class 4.\n\nDescent   Downclimb the last pitch and rappel the route. Be careful of stuck ropes on the first rappel.","protection":"1 set of nuts (#6-10 offsets helpful), double set of cams from black alien to #4 Camalot. A few larger pieces. Extra cams from green alien to #3.5 Camalot for pitch two. (It is easy to back clean on this pitch.)
