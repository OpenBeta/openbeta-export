This is a very seldom-climbed route so, though the crack is very bomber, it is sandy in parts. Short but sweet with an interesting rappel (see protection) in an incredibly beautiful, quiet part of the park.","protection":"Standard desert rack, the crack takes mostly #1 and #0.5 cams. The anchor consists of two dicey petons pounded into a chausy layer on the left-hand side of the notch at the top, so bring larger (#3, #4) cams to back it up at the base of the notch if belaying from the top.\n\nThe best (and safest) way to climb the route is to lead it, top out, and clip in. Then have the leader lower the rope off of the opposite side of the fin so it is essentially folded over it. Have the belayer put the 'rope' back on belay from the crack side of the fin, and finally have the leader rappel off of the belayers body weight off of the opposite side.","location":"Buffalo Crack is located on the west side of Buffalo Rock"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,cbbfd7c6-5cf2-5063-8939-5f3233efa573,1c74163a-11fa-52d2-9377-7a3171ec97f4,8b03fd08-a2e4-5833-bd5b-86657da94827","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Southeast Utah","Arches National Park","Buffalo Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c/d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.59939,38.6242]},"bbox":[-109.5999655599532,38.623750339818145,-109.59881444004681,38.624649660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106801160","area_id":"iwP9CKLkWDO9W4ZlfalIJw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.5999655599532,38.623750339818145],[-109.59881444004681,38.623750339818145],[-109.59881444004681,38.624649660181866],[-109.5999655599532,38.624649660181866],[-109.5999655599532,38.623750339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:58.315Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:39.542Z"}
