The 3rd pitch (5.9 60 ft), sporting lichen covered rock and a loose \"death block\", seemed to be the crux for me.  The first Pitch (5.5 60 ft) belay had no hangers on the bolts.  This could be girth hitched or you could bypass the belay and do pitch 1 and 2 in a long pitch. The death block on the third pitch is at the anchors, wear helmets.  I would have released the block myself but had a dog at the bottom.  If you go to do the 3rd pitch leave all your gear away from the base and knock the block off for future safe climbing!!","protection":"I brought a set of aliens, double tcu's for pitches 1 and 2.  Pitch 3 used some smaller stuff and a 3,4,and 5 camalot.  Fixed pins and bolts for anchors...bring webbing.  bring some runners to clip one bolt on pitch 2 and for girth hitch belay. Rap from P3 to P2 60 ft. and double rope rap from P2 to the ground 150 ft.","location":"The route is an obvious left facing corner at mile seven.
