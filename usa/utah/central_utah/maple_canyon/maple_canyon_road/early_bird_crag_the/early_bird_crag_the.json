This is by far the chossiest climb I've done in Maple so be prepared. The belay stations are in good locations to miss falling rock but still bring a helmet and be incredibly careful.  You pass through several seams of rotten rock.  If you've climbed at Maple much, you will recognize them.  It will be many more ascents before this route cleans up.  When it does clean up, it will be a fun route and worth it for the view alone.","protection":"12 quickdraws to chains + slings and lockers.","location":"This is the first route you pass, on the far left side of the wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ujjAZGwIUYmKilnzElaPjQ==","name":"Eagle Tenders","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Matt Selman","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.68189,39.55575]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107693844","mp_crag_id":"107693825","climb_id":"ujjAZGwIUYmKilnzElaPjQ==","areaRef":"h+ucawuIWz6rS7v5mMK/yQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start by climbing up a small alcove, clip a few bolts and traverse out onto the face.
