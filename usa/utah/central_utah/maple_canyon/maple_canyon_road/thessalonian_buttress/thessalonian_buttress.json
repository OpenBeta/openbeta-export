The hold are there, just get your head in the game. This is a fun climb just for the overall exposure and the great views of the canyon. You can see everything from the top of this climb. The entire route can be climbed and descended with a single 60M rope.\n\nP1: Climb shattered cobbles on a low angle face. The beginning is harder than it looks. Follow bolts through low angle faces and corners to a set of anchors 10' right of \"Pandoras Box\", the shrub-filled hole on the wall left of the climb. 5.8, 25M\n\nP2: Continue up the face moving back and forth slightly though shallow corners, then trend left and across the face near the end of the pitch. 5.7, 28M\n\nP3: This pitch is the pièce de résistance. The short roof right off the belay is engaging, exposed and exciting. It's not overly difficult, and the crux is over in a few moves. Pull huge cobbles just right of the banana-shaped flake that forms this final pitch. Rap from anchors, 5.9, 30M.\n\nIf you want to carry extra quickdraws and save time, it is possible to link P1 and P2 together into one long pitch.","protection":"First pitch takes 20 quick draws to the chain belay.  Second pitch takes about 10 quick draws to the chains.","location":"The first pitch starts left of the column and follow meandering bolts up a rib for about 185' to the overhang.  The second pitch pulls the overhang and follows big jugs up the flake for about 80'.  Rappel the route to get off.
