The bolts are a bit hard to spot initially.\n\nStart up on fairly low-angle choss (with moss) and get up into some muddy-looking conglomerate. The angle steepens here and the climbing gets interesting. Sometimes the next bolt is hard to see; have faith that it's there and look around.\n\nThe top out onto the tower is quite fun and a most unlikely hold eases the transition.\n\nEnjoy the view and the high class summit register. 5.11a.","protection":"16 total draws.
