(20 bolts, bring long draws to reduce rope drag).\n\nPitch 2: Move right 40' to a pod with anchors.\n\nPitch 3: Ascend the wall above (crux) to anchors on the left at a small outcropping. Continue to the summit and sign the register.","protection":"15 quickdraws, 5 long (12\") quichdraws and something for the anchors. P1 is VERY long...a full 60M. And it wanders a little. Short quickdraws will result in some pretty hefty rope drag. Bring some long draws to reduce rope drag.","location":"Approach:\n\nThe trail to the base of the route is about 40 yards before you come to the Matrix. The route is on the south side of the drainage, or left of the drainage if you are facing up-canyon. If you go too far and arrive at the Matrix, the route is behind you and slightly down-canyon. The route starts on the obvious arete left of the Raspberry/Fern filled gully.\n\nDescent:\n\nWith a 60M rope rappel from the anchors at the end of P3 to the anchors in the pod. Make a second rappel to a set of anchors on your right. They are found above a small shelf...watch carefully for them, apparently they are a little hard to find. Several parties have accidentally rappelled past them. From there it is another 30M to the ground at the top of the fern/raspberry filled gully. It's a short distance from there down to the base of the route.\n\nWith a 70M rope simply skip the anchors in the pod and rappel to the anchors our right, then another rappel to the ground."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,f0607fc9-f2ae-58c7-890b-5a98da2849de,7e647943-f7a4-5fd8-bd0e-776f82e86c1b,3c34cdad-9f07-593c-a98b-b16caeccdb00,50ba0ee5-67de-54e3-a687-07817f2bb9bc","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Central Utah","Maple Canyon","Middle Fork","Great Chasm, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.6902,39.5569]},"bbox":[-111.690783222497,39.55645033981814,-111.68961677750299,39.55734966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105914350","area_id":"ULoO5WfeVOOmhweBfyu5vA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:34.379Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:32.847Z"}
