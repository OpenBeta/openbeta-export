Fight through the dirt that constantly pours down the top of the boulder for a slick and not very enjoyable top out.  The FA specified the topout to Infestation should be avoided to complete the true line.\n\nIf the problem were completely clean, this would be a pretty classic climb, but, as the way the boulder is situated on the hill makes that practically impossible, you may just find yourself annoyed at all the dirt causing you grief.","protection":"A pad.
