There are more than a few ways to do it which makes for a great, thought provoking line on good rock.\n\nStart low with a right hand undercling, left hand edge.  An obvious rail above is used above in conjunction with the arete to the left.  You may be able to use your lower extremities to create leverage (kneebar or toehook, dumbass).  Topout is easy but may be friable.\n\nOne of the highest boulders on the hill but worth the hike for sure.  The boulder faces east with a touch of south-east thrown in.  Arete stays sunny all day.","protection":"Nice flat landing but you'll want a few pads.","location":"There are a couple approaches.  Either follow the 'road' up the switchbacks from Nerve Damage until you see a cairn on your right which leads downhill about 100 feet (I think it's at least 3 or so switchbacks).  There is also a good but diminishing trail from Area 51 leading past Pitbull Terror and Roll The Bones; keep going up the hill.
