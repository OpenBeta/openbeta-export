A slightly overhanging crimp and compression problem that is sure to become a classic.  PG-13 rating because while it is not super tall I did think I was going to die when I did it.  And yes... that divot taken out of the right hand crimp at the lip is from my foot crumpling as I did the committing mantle.","protection":"Many pads and a good spotter.  The top section is to be reckoned with for sure and will clean up well after a few more ascents, but still has some loose sand up there.","location":"The route is up and left from the intersection mentioned in the intro to this area.

Big moves on mostly good holds this is a thug climber's dream come true.  Route begins matched on underclings and climbs through good crimps to a jug and then huck for your life for an ok sloper right foot up and then SLAP! and SLAP! again, move your right foot up to the top of the jug and huck for the lip.  Top out is fairly easy.  A neo-classic for sure.  The jug at head height has broken since the first ascent and is probably V10 itself from this hold, the bottom into the jug is in the V5-6 range. On the same level of awesomeness as Life, Jitterbug Perfume and Trent's Mom, Black Dahlia is for sure one of the best V10's in Joe's.","protection":"3-4 pads potential to take a back slap landing from ten feet up so spot carefully.","location":"This route is up and left about 100-150 yards from the intersection of trails.
