Left two up on the arete and do a big move to a could sloper jug. Walk feet up and grab a crimp at the edge of the roof with the right. Heel hook the jug that you just had your hand on and cross with the right to an awesome multi-pocket pinch. Toe down on the edge of the arete (so that your biking) and go up left hand to a good undercling. Heel hook the sloper jug and bust out to the (good) hemhock hold.\n\nNow there are two ways. One that involves hemhocking, and heelhooking in order to match the feature with a good pinch for the left, however this way it is hard to keep your feet. Taller folk bust up to the first of three crimps with the right hand and get it as a pinch, then heel hook and fall in.\n\nFrom here work through a series of good crimps until you get the good crimp that sits just around the left arete (don't dab on the boulder beside). Match feet (very tenuous) and grab and undercling at shoulder height. Stand up and go big out left around the lip.
