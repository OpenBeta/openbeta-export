If your skin is wrecked from crimping hard this route offers some of the most polished skin-friendly rock at Joe's.\n\nBeta:  Begin matched on the low crimp.  Right foot on a right facing side pull and left foot either toehooking or heelhooking to get compression.  Do a big move to a half pad rounded crimp.  Campus match a crimp just up and left of this crimp.  Put your left foot on the starting crimp.  Right hand cross, straight up from crimps, then left hand out, switch feet on the start hold bump right hand up and left hand out, then switch feet again.  Put right foot up on the first crimp and rock over.","protection":"2 pads.  Spotter for the top out.","location":"200 yards up gully after you cross the river.  The start is an obvious crimp.
