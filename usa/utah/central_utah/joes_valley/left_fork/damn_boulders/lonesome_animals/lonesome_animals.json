Make technical and awesome compression moves up the scoop/dihedral, using poor sidepulls and worse feet. At the top of the scoop, execute a huge and low percentage move to a good edge. Keep it together through blind heel hooking and small crimps to an easier top out over the sweet log landing.","protection":"3 pads should do it. The log landing is nice but really only protects the very end of the problem.","location":"On Lonesome Animals boulder, the most obvious line on the upper left side of the wall.
