It will be on the left hand side if coming up canyon and you should be able to just barely see the dam from certain spots of the parking. Head up the opposite side of the road to the right of a massive wash. Head slightly down canyon, but uphill. A trail should emerge after no more than 1-2 minutes of walking; it will switch from heading more down canyon to heading more up the hillside. In around 5-10 minutes you'll arrive at the roof."},"__v":0},{"_id":"HUlGd3wKXHWyI/ciR9bYJA==","name":"A River Runs Through It","yds":"V7","grades":{"yds":"V7","font":"7A+","vscale":"V7"},"fa":"Ryan Held, 2009?","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.25585,39.28995]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"110021367","mp_crag_id":"110021352","climb_id":"HUlGd3wKXHWyI/ciR9bYJA==","areaRef":"hjhJGw2SWBWHEBbgk5TeYQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start sitting on crimps and compress up crimps and sloper features.\n\nInfo stolen from:\n\niclimbrocks.blogspot.com/20â€¦","protection":"A few pads","location":"Past the 6 mile marker in Left Fork.
