Begin squatting on incut crimps with poor feet. The first two moves, which utilize a unique and poor left hand crimp and a long move to a sharp pocket, are the crux. From here, a left-trending system of brilliant crimps and slots leads out over a built landing and eventually a very heady and exposed mantle onto a seemingly blank slab. Climb the long friction slab with ease to the top of the boulder.\n\nPOT is a full package V11 with a brutal crimp crux, consistent, perfect edging, and a committing mantle that lies beyond the landing and leads into the no-fall zone.","protection":"At least 4 pads and a spot. Safe climbing until the mantle, which is pretty unprotected.","location":"From the POT parking, locate 2 massive boulders up the hill. Many hard highballs have yet to be done here.
