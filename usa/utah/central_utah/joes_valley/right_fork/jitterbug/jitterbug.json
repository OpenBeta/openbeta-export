Continue up the arete with hard compression moves and top out on a somewhat tricky mantle.\n\nThe FA called this climb v12; it was super cold the day they did it so this overgrade was likely somewhat influenced by that. V9 has been suggested but this feels harder than every 9 in Joe's that I've tried. Edit: It appears there are over 15 ascents registered at V10 on 8a and only a couple at V9. The grade on Mtn project doesn't represent current consensus from what I can tell.\n\nAlso of note; Michael Sabatini/Sabo spent days smashing the choss rock out of the way that formerly blocked the middle of the problem; you the man!","protection":"Pads.
