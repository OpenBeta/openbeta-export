Begin sitting on a low jug all the way down and right on the main arete of the boulder. Work up the bad arete all the while sitting in a huge left toehook. Eventually the holds on the arete run out and using a horrible right foot smear, the toehook must be released as you jump for a distant jug higher on the arete. Either top out here, or continue up the arete until its apex, as the original line was done (V11 PG-13).\n\nCounter Clockwork is unique to JV as it has almost no face holds, and is a sunny, skin friendly arete, although it is incredibly morpho. V10-12 depending on height, as the holds used to jump to the jug may be impossible to reach for anyone under 5’10.","protection":"Pads. Flat landing with a potential back slapper rock at the finish, though it isn’t really an issue.","location":"The main (and only) line on the boulder. SDS at the bottom of the beautiful arching arete.
