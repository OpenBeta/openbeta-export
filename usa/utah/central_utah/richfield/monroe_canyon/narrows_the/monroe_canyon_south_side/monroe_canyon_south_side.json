It climbs a crack like feature up the face of Quatize like rock. About half way up, you’ll find the crux as the crack turns into a thin chimney. Above that the crack ends and there are a lot of flakes and edges to the top out.","protection":"There are something like 21 or so bolts to fixed chain anchors.","location":"It is just a short ways up the road from Knezek didn’t fall here. If you go just up the road you’ll see a fork just past all the climbs on your left. If you park there and go across the Monroe Creek you’ll see a small Island surrounded by cliffs. If you’re facing the cliffs it will be on the far right side of the island."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,f0607fc9-f2ae-58c7-890b-5a98da2849de,e4ea7d82-7517-5691-a07b-11c272a9207a,f40b48a8-d1e0-52f9-bd4d-22fc728ab19c,69efe02e-a864-59b4-867e-3d7eda084576,e9b4a4e5-59b1-58f5-8289-c2d1f1e4b8c5","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Central Utah","Richfield","Monroe Canyon","Narrows, The","Monroe Canyon: South Side"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.08504,38.5992]},"bbox":[-112.0856153594254,38.59875033981814,-112.08446464057461,38.59964966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119688102","area_id":"6bSk5VmxWPWCicLR8eS4xQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:58.800Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:49.778Z"}
