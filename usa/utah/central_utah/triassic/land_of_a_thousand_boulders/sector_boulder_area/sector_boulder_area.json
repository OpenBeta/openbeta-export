Start at a crouch with both hands matched on an incut angular jug under the boulder. Get your feet on and do a big move to a sloper with your left hand. Now the fun begins!

Let loose of the starting jug with your right hand and now unhook your feet and spin around right-side up. Next establish higher above the roof using the incut horizontals and work you way up a few crimps and edges to the exciting slopey top out. (As will all Triassic top-outs, you may want to identify and brush the top out holds pre-send!)","protection":"A couple of pads and a spotter- typical sandy and slopey triassic top-out.","location":"Pass through the corridor to the left of Busted Up (the obvious v5 arete).
