What makes this climb a classic in my book are a few things.  1) It is a route with enough length.  2)  It is consistently 5.9, yes.. it eases up a bit here and there, but it isn't a 5.6 with a 5.9 move.  3) good rock 4)  Varied climbing exists on this route.  Juggy roofs, laybacking, sidepulls, thin edges, mantles, smears, friction holds, what else could you ask for.

It almost deserves 4 stars, and I might change my mind yet.  It is a very good route.  It start with an easy first bolt (probably the easiest 1st bolt on the wall).  Then it gets hard, forcing you to smear and edge very tenuous holds.  Hands aren't much help but they are key.  Maybe that didn't make sense.  A key hand-hold is there to move through the crux; however, the hands don't mark your success through most of this lower section, but good footwork does.  After the 3rd bolt, the climbing eases up and hands are good again.  The Ruckman's book shows a 5.10a mini-crux at the last bolt, but I never even noticed it.

I am just over 6 foot tall, and by using the 2 small ledges above the main ledge and left of the piton, standing on my tiptoes, and holding the biner to clip at the base of it and in the furthest tips of my fingers and levitating just a bit, I was able to clip it.
