Look for a bolt low down about 5m above the start. This route merges with the 1991 Tim Broughton climb called Gastronomy Crack toward the top, but does not alter that line. I recently spoke with Tim and he was excited to hear that this was added. His route traverses under the large roof and then after reaching the left side of the crack system, he did cut back right and continued to the top via the arete (same finish as for When Time Has No Meaning). This is contrary to the guidebook topo, incidentally. He also said others had placed the two-bolt belay/rappel station.\n\nPitch #1: Continue directly up the sharp arete, run out at times, passing about 4 bolts. The leader will encounter a fixed piton up high, which is how GC finishes. Remain on the arete until the top of the crag clipping a bolt (placed as a directional/belay) and traverse to the Gastronomy Crack Ledge two-bolt belay to the right. 5.7, 50m.","protection":"QDs, Set of Camalots to #2 including small Nuts\n\n4 bolts and original belay chains.","location":"Rappel straight down from the exisitng anchors into a gully with one 60m rope.
