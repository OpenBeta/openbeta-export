To find it, hike up and around south and east perhaps 100 feet from the Cuban, to the base of a nice slab.  Slab your way east with the sun at your back with the climbing easing after ~60 feet.  The slabbing isnt particularly hard, but theres no pro for at least the first 40 feet.  I thought the climbing would be easier, and once in, drilling was a more difficult option than just running it out.  Belay at a slung chickenhead and bolt at the top of the formation, about 40 feet down and south of the summit of the Cuban.  Rap off south and west.  Not worth doing on its own, but if youre in the neighborhood with the rocket already in your pocket, slab it up.","protection":"Standard light rack.","location":"Up and right (south) from the base of the western most tongue of the Cuban- perhaps about 100 feet, slightly hidden.

It is a direct threat to capitalism.\n\nPitch one: Pick your poison. Either climb the obvious trough splitting the center of the lower formation (5.5 grovel) or the fantastic bulging slab on the left (5.5X). Or the molted face on the right (5.9 TR). Whichever way leads to a large ledge with a single bolt and poor gear belay. 100'.\n\nPitch two: Climb the bottoming/flared crack off the ledge (5.9) to a short section of brush battle. Or climb the cool slab on the right (directly above the bolt) 5.8 R. Pass the brush on the left and climb fun hands/slab up an ever narrowing formation. Use care with this crack as it leads straight to hell (or at least the hollow underbelly of the formation). ~100' of rope leads to a semi-awkward belay at a rounded spike.\n\nPitch three: Cool, semi-exposed slabbing up the pinnacle summit. Lead out across easy terrain following the humped-back spine. Run it out for ~twenty five feet through moderate terrain to a hidden hangerless bolt (I strangely came up short on hangers...). Ten more feet lead to a bomber horizontal crack and a step onto Fidel's Cap. A final bolt protects the fantastic 5.8 finish. Belay off a natural arch/hole on the tight summit. ~60'.","protection":"A light rack including a #3 camalot, one rivet hanger (or stopper) and extra webbing/slings.  Four bolts (all hand drilled- wilderness...) total on the route- three on the semi-poorly protected final pitch.","location":"Descent:  Rappel off the backside utilizing some odd traversing/climbing to reach the notch on the east.
