If you only have a 50 meter rope you may need to belay at the trees as I am not sure if it will reach the chain anchor above. (This would cause the climb to be three pitches.) A 60 meter rope will reach, so continue up past the trees to the belay anchor.  There is a move of 5.7 perhaps as you pull a bulge reaching the anchor.\n\nPitch two:Climb the crux offwidth above the chains (5.7), kind of hard to protect.  I don't want to give the answer away, but there is an easy way to climb this and a hard way.  See what happens.  This only lasts 10 feet or so and then you are on an angling crack moving up and right.  You will come to a point where you will have the opportunity to traverse down a sloping slab to the right. BE SURE to protect the second here as you traverse down.  Belay at the big ledge.\n\nDescent:Scramble up right and then down the gully.  It is a walk off.\n\nFYI: To put this climb in perspective, the first time my partner and I roped up to climb this classic we were joined by a guy who was soloing the route at the same time.
