From the blocks, climb the obvious left leaning crack across the face and around the corner to a gear belay on top of the cliff.  The left leaning crack is very similar to the upper portion of Mexican Crack.  It is basically a Mexican crack which feels like 5.11-.  The rock is a bit gritty, but the line is classic and seems like it would clean up reasonably with more ascents.","protection":"Bring a set of nuts and a set of cams.","location":"Starts at the base of a large groove system on the South face.

Unfortunately a large spat of scrub oak in the middle of climb seriously detracts from its quality.  I found myself wishing I was sipping scotch rather than playing this game of hopscotch.\n\nClimb a quality but gritty corner (lieback and hands) for about thirty feet before traversing along a short sidewalk to the offending scrub oak.  Tunnel your way upward, reaching the crouton-laden crux above.  Unfortunately, at this point you are out of sight of your belayer, so muster your courage and fire away.  Fun lie-backing awaits, but so does a whipper into the trees if you blow it.  Belay at the intersection of Statis by looping some eroding hoodoos.
