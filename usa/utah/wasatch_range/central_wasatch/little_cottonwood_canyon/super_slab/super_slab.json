All pitches were climbed traditionally from ground up.\n\nPitch #1-Pitch #4: Climb Slippery Slab and see the Smoot details on that route. 5.9\n\nPitch #5: Continue straight up from the last pitch belay of Slippery Slab passing several bolts. Some memorable moves, but generally gets you to the better climbing up higher. 5.7, 30m.\n\nPitch #6: A dirty pitch, but not that bad. Look for bolts you may still have trouble finding. Trend first right, then left through some easy overlaps and eventually hit the two-bolt belay. 5.7, 30m.\n\nPitch #7: Look for the next bolts. Climb past some bulges on the slab to a belay off to the right where a ledge has been cleared. 5 bolts, 5.7, 30m.\n\nPitch #8: From the belay, move left to the tree and climb thin slab to the first bolt. Run out, but EZ climbing takes you to another two-bolt belay on a good ledge. 4 bolts 5.7+, 30m.\n\nPitch #9: The money pitch thus far! Climb the weak groove to the steeper slab. Traverse up and right to small knobs and continue up the slab past easier climbing to a two-bolt belay. Some run out sections, but well protected where the difficulty is concentrated. Have your slab shoes and skills on for this pitch! Exciting climbing of good quality. 9 bolts, 5.10b,R, 50m (This pitch has been Red pointed only once...would like to get other opinions about grade!).\n\nPitch #10: Hours of cleaning yielded a nice finger crack/dihedral up this next section of the slab. Protects well with small gear and continue following the crack until it traverses left under the roof to a two-bolt belay. Upper exploration revealed exfoliating and deteriorating granite. 5.10, 40m.\n\nPitch #5-#8?? belay anchors installed by ooo prior to this climbers arrival.
