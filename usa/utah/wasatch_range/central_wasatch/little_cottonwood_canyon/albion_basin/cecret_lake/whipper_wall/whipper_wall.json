However I personally find them very usable.  The start might have some green slime around it. Start in a steep left facing corner, climb up passing 1 bolt to a mantle. From here find that sweet jug, lean out and clip the bolt. The holds are hard to find and use but they are there. There was a fixed chain draw on bolt 3 to help with the hard clip. After clipping the 3rd there are a few ways to do it, straight up (which is hardest) or going out left and coming back in the \"line\" (exciting!). The route feels a lot longer than 4 bolts!\n\nI personally wouldn't let any green horns belay me on this, attention is a must.","protection":"QD's","location":"Start on the far right side of the Whipper Wall on the west side.
