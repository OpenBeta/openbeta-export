Not too serious, however! It ascends the prominent pillar of the North West Face. Some afternoon sun, but not as high as DC. Most loose rock has been cleaned, but approach as you would any climb up at Devil's Castle and wear helmets and climb cautiously.\n\nPitch #1: Starts just to the right (west) of a large low angle gully. Some dirty or broken up sections down low lead to a cruxy edgy section with very good rock. Climb past about 8 bolts to a 3 bolt belay ledge. 5.10+, 25m.\n\nPitch #2: Steep, juggy, and pumpy moves up good rock past 4 bolts leads to lower angle terrain. Pass 4 more bolts to a ramp which leads to the two-bolt belay ledge. 5.10+, 25m.\n\n2 rappels down the route with one rope.","protection":"10 QDs and one or two shoulder slings. Some climbers may opt to carry 2-3 micro-small Camalots. Well protected with Glue-in Bolts at the anchors.","location":"The Devil's Tongue probably has another name from the Alta Ski Patrol, but it was unknown by this climber. This is a prominent buttress low and east of the well known Devil's Castle Apron ski run.\n\nThe approach to the beginning of the crag from the Albion Basin Campground is shorter than for Devil's Castle and probably was no more than 15-20 minutes."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,e838736e-03de-5522-b170-850c7ffcb2ac,007f1fc1-3268-5660-b397-b7543d332216,37be8a7e-f59c-5ef4-aadb-bfe9a5893db1,9f196de7-2220-5211-95ea-74d28cc11116","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Central Wasatch","Little Cottonwood Canyon","Albion Basin","Devil's Tongue"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.6194,40.57792]},"bbox":[-111.61999203045967,40.57747033981813,-111.61880796954034,40.578369660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106012995","area_id":"nxlt5yIgUhGV6nTSjMERFg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.61999203045967,40.57747033981813],[-111.61880796954034,40.57747033981813],[-111.61880796954034,40.578369660181856],[-111.61999203045967,40.578369660181856],[-111.61999203045967,40.57747033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:26.448Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:34.329Z"}
