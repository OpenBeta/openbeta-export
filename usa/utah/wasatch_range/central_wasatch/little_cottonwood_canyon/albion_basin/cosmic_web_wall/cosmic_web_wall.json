Big jug climbing 90% of the way followed up by a scary leftward traverse over suspect rock. Most people feel the crux is traversing over the rotten rock clipping the bolt in the middle of the traverse and then proceeding to the anchors with wrap rings. A couple of bolts do not become evident until you are right to them. The bolts are hard to spot from the bottom. You must have faith!!","protection":"Quickdraws. Anchors at the top with wrap rings.","location":"This route is the southern-most route on the west side of cosmic web wall. It shares the first two bolts with unknown right of chimney. There is a long runout over easy terrain between the 2nd and 3rd bolt. One may be able to slip a piece of gear between these two bolts if desired.
