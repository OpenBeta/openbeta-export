Although probably best considered a \"sport route,\" it has much more adventure than your typical clip-up, requiring a blend of slab technique, creativity, and power.  Rumor has it that some holds have broken off, particularly on the first pitch, which I don't doubt given what appears to be some of the remnants and a short section of dubious rock around the quasi-hanging belay.  However, it still goes at \"easy\" 12, and if this is your standard and you haven't been on it, you just gotta do it.  I bet there isn't another route like it in Utah.\n\n(1) Relatively easy climbing protected by gear leads up to a rising traverse past five well-spaced bolts to the stance.  The climbing gets increasingly challenging and trickier to figure out the closer you get to the small foot-stance that serves as the belay.  Probably 12a, but I'll go 12b given the mental calculus and zen-like balance needed to solve the crux.  A short chain was added a few years ago to one of the bolts to make the clip easier, I think, but it also helps the logistics of bailing if the crux proves too much.\n\n(2) Make a few moves up past a bolt and step around the corner to wild climbing protected by a few more bolts and outstanding exposure.  Chains on top.  If this pitch were off the ground, it likely would get more traffic that\n\nAll Chalk\n\n.  Probably a give-away 12a.
