Belay from a comfortable, low-angled stance located just beneath the start of the Mouth Variation (.11).  Step across a gaping chasm and into the cleft just beneath the obvious Mouth slot.  You may encounter a bit of dirt and/or moss--most of the holds were cleaned during our ascent--on the thin edges as the route meanders in and out of the corner past two pins.  Pull out of the corner then onto a slab with a two pin anchor.  The final pitch climbs a right-diagonalling crack through an overlap, then past a scary flake resting precariously on a ledge below the final steep, wide crack.

Dave was a true off-width master and had discovered many of the early gems in the Wasatch, including those on Memorial Day Buttress.\n\nWe climbed two of the pitches that day and were a bit chased off due to impending darkness and windy cold weather. Nevertheless, we had a great adventure. The unfinished route (with the two pitches) made its way into the Ruckman guide that was published in the Spring of 1998. It was called El Viento Es Frio (Spanish for \"the wind is cold\"....which Dave and I had decided to call the climb after shivering in that November snowstorm.\n\nDave was later tragically killed while being rescued after suffering from serious injuries in an avalanche while skiing in Pink Pine in January 1998. The AirMed helicopter crashed and all perished. Jim Howe, another friend of Dave's and mine, thought it a nice idea to finish it and give it the new name.
