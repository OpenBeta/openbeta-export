Killer thin crack liebacking.  The crux is placing gear.  The second pitch rounds the ear and goes up and past the horn with the slings.  Climbing through to the horn in one pitch gives the most continuous climbing and goes to an obvious stance, but requires a 70m rope and the rock just past the original anchor spot is a bit grotty.  I've never climbed past the horn, reportedly the rock of the second pitch is of less quality than the first pitch.","protection":"One piton, which still looks fairly solid.  The second piton was removed 10/11/07 because it was cracked and redundant, clean pro is found above and below.  There are several good nut placements, bring multiples of small TCUs, and hand sizes for the handcrack.  Placing gear is the crux for most.  The two-bolt anchor with tattered nylon was revised 10/11/07.  The 1/4\" X 1\" bolt was rusted and removed with almost no effort.  It was replaced with a 3/8\" X 3.5\" bolt with a stainless ring anchor.  The other bolt looks OK and should be safe, it has a biner with rap ring on it.  Thirty feet of unsightly tattered nylon was removed.\n\nFor a more continuous pitch, climb past the anchors, around the ear, to the obvious stance under the horn with the slings and biners.  Lowering from here requires a 70m.","location":"Obvious perfect shallow dihedral on east-facing wall across from the base of Intensive Care.  One can rap the first pitch with a 60m rope, be careful with anything shorter.
