Midway through the route, there are some great cracks.  A small bulge must be reckoned with to reach the belay.  More easy pockets and edges on a low incline lead above the belay anchors to a rightward arching lip.  A lieback crux guards the top.  A rightward shuffle leads to the anchor.  I wouldn't be surprised if most people skip the top 40 feet or so and just do the first pitch.","protection":"13 black bolts (if leading in one long pitch) or 8 QDs for the first and 4 QDs for the second.
