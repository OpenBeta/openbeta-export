This route is short, but good. Four bolts lead to a two bold anchor with chains. Head up on some angular slopey holds to clip the first 2 bolts. There's a horizontal crack just above the second bolt where you can get a good hand jam, but I couldn't clip the third bolt from here. At this point you either do a cruxy move out left onto a bit of slab to clip the 3rd bolt or go right (I think this is the intended line) on more slopers to an undercling. I found these moves pumpy and was grateful for the jug of an undercling because this brings you to the crux of pulling up left to get above the 3rd bolt. 4th bolt is chest level at this point and clipping stance is decent. A couple more moves gets you into a low angle chimney to the anchors.\n\nThe route seemed short, but I was there when snow covered the stream and probably cit off the first 5-10 feet of the climb.\n\nLooks like it would be fairly easy to traverse right to the anchors of Land of the Free to top rope, but I found the .11a more straight forward than and just as strenuous as the .10d","protection":"4 draws and 2 more for the anchor.
