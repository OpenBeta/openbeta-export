Two beginnings exist, but I only know the one shared with the Start of Strewn Masters.Head up and left under a roof about 10 feet of the ground using plenty of features.  Plug a large piece in the roof with a runner then dance left to a thin crack with flexy things here and there.  Work your way carefully up to flexy block to find solid rock above it.  From the block to the seam above is the crux, fingers divided here and there with a hand, but the climbing remains pumpy until the end.  The climb has been extended a bit to add a fun over hanging hand crack to the chains.","protection":"Cams up to 4\" with several TCu-sized pieces and nuts.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"NwWE8K9eXWe0Xg/JDapiDA==","name":"Tick Fever","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"FA: L.

There is no protection until you get to the crack but the climbing is easy once you get off the ground.  Traverse to the left side of the tooth and follow the crack around the tooth with some stemming and liebacking.  The climbing to this point is easy and fun with good gear.
