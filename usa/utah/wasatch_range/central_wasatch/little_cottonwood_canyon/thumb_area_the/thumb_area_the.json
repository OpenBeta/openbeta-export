However, the climbing is 5.3/5.4 ish and a fall could be devastating. So for safety's sake I will call this pitch one. Do not climb the chimney. Work up and right in cracks, then move back left into the main gully (having bypassed the chimney.) Be carefull of loose rocks. Move up the gully until you can't go any further.\n\nPitch two:Two options to start, either climb up and right in cracks then traverse left to a fixed pin, or climb up the gully further (sometimes really wet)and move right up the corner to the pin. Approximately at the pin you are going to climb the chimney/offwidth above to your left. Above this is a two bolt anchor. Caution, loose rocks.\n\nPitch three: (I did not climb this pitch... I followed the Indecent Exposure Variation.)Climb up the loose gully, Caution! Loose rocks.  Belay below a big slot?  Use your best judgement.\n\nPitch four: (I did not climb this pitch... I followed the Indecent Exposure Variation.)Continue up the slot/gully/crack? until you reach lunch ledge.  Belay on lunch ledge.\n\nPitch five:Traverse right crossing to the east end of lunch ledge (4th class) to a belay stance at the ledge's end. You can belay at a solid bush.\n\nPitch six:This seems to be the pitch most people like to talk about. It is definitely unique. Climb up and right in cracks thru a small overhang/roof and into the obvious granite trough. You are gaining some exposure and the valley is spread out below. Small placements in the bottom of the trough are definitely possible. I found two number four camalots to come in handy on this pitch, although they are not needed. Work your way up the trough to a two bolt anchor on your right.\n\nPitch seven:Climb the easy, secure (you would have a hard time falling out), not very protectable (scary looking to some) 5.6 chimney above. It is kind of miserable if you are carrying a pack on a hot day. Some recommend climbing on the right edge of the chimney and stemming across, instead of squeezing your way up. Whatever feels comfortable. Belay above the chimney on a nice ledge below the formation called the \"ear.\"\n\nPitch eight:You can continue up the chimney above (5.7R) and move right, or you can traverse to the right from the ledge (5.5)up and around the bulge to belay in bushes.\n\nPitch nine:(5.2) Work your way up the gully to your left until a big drop is seen on your right. The thumb formation is above you.\n\nPitch ten:Climb up and left across the big slab on easy terrain until you come to a dirt path/trail. Belay in trees.\n\nHike up to the ridgline to the left (northwest) of the thumb itself. (No need for a belay here really...you are walking through bushes, etc.) You can leave gear at this ridge. During the last pitch you will climb up and rappel back down returning again to the same spot.\n\nPitch eleven:Step across the gap from the ridgeline over to the thumb formation. Before you do this, look for the obvious old black bolt on the northeast side. Step across grabbing big holds, place some gear to back up the bolt and gingerly stand up so that the bolt is by your waist. Reach up and grab the summit ridge, friction up with your feet and mantle onto the top. Walk across to the summit bush and belay. Enjoy the view, rappel from the bush, hike back up the ridgeline and over.\n\nDescent:Only one rope is needed for these rappels.\n\nYou want to end up in the second gully to the east. There seem to be a couple of variations at first, here is the way I went... Drop down from the ridgeline into the first gully (you will see a trail going down.) Before you get to the end of this gully you are going to hike left and up a little bit to a notch (to the northeast) downclimbing/rappeling into the next gully to the east. I noticed a cairn. Hike down this gully until you come to a bolted rappel at the top of a big slab. Follow this gully down and then moving to the right...stay to the right of the slabs down thru the gully to possibly one last rappel (depending on your willingness to downclimb the slippery 30 feet)... and down until you reach the approach trail.\n\nIt should be noted that you do not end up at the base of the climb. So if you are planning on leaving your packs at the base, before the climb, you want them at the bottom of Plumb Line gully, by the base of Plumb Line wall.\n\nBring lots of water and sunglasses. The granite slabs get pretty bright in the sunshine.\n\nIn my opinion this route is barely two stars... it is definitely worth doing once. I would do it again with certain friends, but it isn't really that classic overall. It is just a nice opportunity to climb a cool formation, and spend the day climbing 11 moderate pitches.","protection":"Standard trad rack is fine.
