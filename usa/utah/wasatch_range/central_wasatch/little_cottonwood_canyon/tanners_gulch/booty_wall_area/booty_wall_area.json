Tyler Phillips helped me aid the first half and the line out right, which makes for excellent steep aid climbing. We broke a lot of holds, took some huge whippers, blew out some blocks and destroyed a few pitons. In the end, adding a few bolts seemed prudent.\n\nMany partners helped me clean this with varying degrees of enthusiasm for getting dust in their eyes, nose and lungs. Mike Perkins had the best beta which he can't remember.\n\nThis is a fun line with very clean falls and bomber gear. Super huge jugs for most of it with two cruxes at the end that feel v4-ish.\n\nAbout the grade: No one really cares. Just remember that everything is easier when you don't have to hang the gear. Everything is harder on the onsite burn. Clipping pre-placed gear on your second burn might make you feel better about yourself and downgrade it. Have fun with that.","protection":"When I first started doing this line, the granite was legitimately suspect and I had to use far more cams that you might need now. If you're intimidated by steep gear protected climbing, bring doubles of fingers to .75, 1 red and 1 yellow camalot, long runners for the transition left and 3-4 quickdraws for the bolts.\n\nYou'll need a lot less once now that it's cleaner and/or once you get it wired. You\n\ncan\n\nplace a couple of finger sized cams after the middle bolt to protect the moves up and left\n\nbut I had these pop on me several time\n\ns\n\nand stopped using them. Maybe that was before more modern cams or maybe the crack there was a little too shallow back then?\n\nI removed the knifeblade piton and added a bolt 7/24/13. The piton had been in place for about 4 years and although it was hard to get out the blade was super rusted. Even though it's under a roof, a waterfall to the right soaks everything when it rains.\n\nRappel: The best way to rap down from the top of both Heisenberg and White Lines is to go off the top of the last two bolts on either climb (ie off the two fixed draws of Heisenberg).
