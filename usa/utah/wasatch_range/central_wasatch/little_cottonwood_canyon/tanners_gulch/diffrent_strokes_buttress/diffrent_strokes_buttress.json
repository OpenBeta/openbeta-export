The start is marked by a pin broken, climbing follows. Climb up past pin (long runner) towards the small mini-roofs, do not pass any placements. Climb up steep face passing 2 bolts and some fun jugs. From 2nd bolt climb up and slightly left into very cool left facing corner and pockets! Place a TCU in this section and continue up passing 2 more bolts, make a left-ward traverse to the right facing corner and beautiful rock. Climb up and left out of the corner on small shelf.

The Gary Colman Corner: Belay at fixed pin at the bottom of the corner, a hand cam can be used as additional pro for the belay (directly behind the dead trees). TCU's are $ on this pitch. The start is fingers to a tree, then some off-fingers.The top has several ways to do it, they are all fun. Climb passed the chain belay/rap and traverse over underneath the big roof, small gear can be found for a good ?belay? and stance. Short, Black, Surly 5.9 45 ft.\n\nP4. From natural belay under the roof climb straight up to the corner. This section is The Gooch, as of now it is un-freed and requires a couple aid moves. Aid on bolt to the pin, from here free climbing is possible. Climb up the corner placing TCU's, clip a fixed pin, make a wild move(s) to the bolt and stance from there cruise to the top of the dihedral. At the top of the dihedral take the left hand option passing a bolt and climb through the wide section of the roof. From here the exposure is really nice; clip a few more fixed pins to the belay at the Philip Drummond Ledge. A beautiful corner, it has some of the coolest granite in Tanners. 5.9 A1 100 ft.\n\nP5.(The Anniversary Pitch) From the Philip Drummond Ledge climb up and left onto the Black Streak. Clip several bolts and trend right towards the obvious flake. The finish has several options, straight up the wide flake, traverse out right (recommended) and climb very cool cracks and dikes, or go out left for some grassy, funky love. 5.11c","protection":"Lots of full length runners.
