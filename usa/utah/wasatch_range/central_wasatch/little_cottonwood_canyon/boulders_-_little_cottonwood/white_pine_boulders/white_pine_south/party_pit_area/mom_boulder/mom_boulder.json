Start sitting with a thin pad on the rock. Feet go about as low down on the wall as I can get them, left hand is near my waist, on an oblong rounded hold. Right hand is a little higher, on a crimpy little ball-- maybe shoulder height when I am sitting (this hold is circled in Tanner's LCC app guidebook).
