This is just deeper than a huge edge.\n\nEuro Trash, above, starts on the next obvious undercling down. It's about 3 feet deeper. Climb up through a hard gaston, and then finish on Euro Roof.\n\nEuro Roof Low starts still lower\n\nEuro Roof Lowest (? hasn't been done, or named), starts another ~20 feet back."},"__v":0},{"_id":"NoK+/sNLVHCJOvXDE00M1A==","name":"Euro Roof","yds":"V10","grades":{"yds":"V10","font":"7C+","vscale":"V10"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.68828,40.57335]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"111065942","mp_crag_id":"111065933","climb_id":"NoK+/sNLVHCJOvXDE00M1A==","areaRef":"D4u4XOs0Vfe90aLPIMMcmQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start with two underclings in the middle of the roof.
