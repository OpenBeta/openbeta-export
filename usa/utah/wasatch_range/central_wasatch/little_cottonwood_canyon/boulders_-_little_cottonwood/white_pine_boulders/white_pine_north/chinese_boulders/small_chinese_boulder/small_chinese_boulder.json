Do a big move with the right hand to a not-so-good crimp on the right face of the arete. Now bump the left hand up many times until it lands in the final highest good slot left of the arete. Get your feet reset under you and dyno for the lip! The hardest part is clamping down on the poor right hand crimp for so long while you re-position your left hand and feet so many times to set up for the dyno. This problem has long been considered v5, but it feels significantly harder to me than\n\nFortune Cookie\n\n(v5) to the left, and most other problems graded v5 I can think of in the canyon...I think v6 is more realistic.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"9k7sNLALUyu9lETEzkn/3A==","name":"Beached Whale","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"May 2021","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.689,40.575]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"120694929","mp_crag_id":"105835173","climb_id":"9k7sNLALUyu9lETEzkn/3A==","areaRef":"yuWXouojUAmD00F7I7LWfQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the right side of the boulder and traverse to the left, as hands get higher move feet higher until you hook your heel on the top of the boulder and finish the route, ending up face down on top of the boulder like a beached whale.","protection":"","location":"Small Chinese Boulder in Little Cottonwood Canyon"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,e838736e-03de-5522-b170-850c7ffcb2ac,007f1fc1-3268-5660-b397-b7543d332216,c6dbcb5f-af07-5552-b2a1-a98549545436,af168e72-fe4f-5c82-971a-fbe44bc527e7,34271bb7-79b9-5e76-8def-5bd9237cce5a,42264244-7d01-50ec-9eb7-bd003cc2c7b5,cae597a2-ea23-5009-83d3-417b23b2d67d","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Central Wasatch","Little Cottonwood Canyon","Boulders - Little Cottonwood","White Pine Boulders","White Pine North","Chinese Boulders","Small Chinese Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V5"},{"count":1,"label":"V5-6"},{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.689,40.575]},"bbox":[-111.68959200462118,40.574550339818146,-111.68840799537881,40.57544966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105835173","area_id":"yuWXouojUAmD00F7I7LWfQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.68959200462118,40.574550339818146],[-111.68840799537881,40.574550339818146],[-111.68840799537881,40.57544966018186],[-111.68959200462118,40.57544966018186],[-111.68959200462118,40.574550339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:27.884Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:35.522Z"}
