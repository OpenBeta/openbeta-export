If you stack more than 2 pads you may be skipping the first foot move, which is quite difficult. Make a couple of desperate high steps, meeting up with the left arete at the top.\n\nIt may need another brushing as it hasn't been climbed in a while.\n\nBig thank you to Jim for finding these boulders and to John Weinberg for leveling out the landing!","protection":"2 pads","location":"Obvious slab up the gully"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,e838736e-03de-5522-b170-850c7ffcb2ac,007f1fc1-3268-5660-b397-b7543d332216,c6dbcb5f-af07-5552-b2a1-a98549545436,df43c9f5-36d2-5c62-8571-e98c2f041cf1","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Central Wasatch","Little Cottonwood Canyon","Boulders - Little Cottonwood","Jimbo's Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.73007,40.56952]},"bbox":[-111.73066195614004,40.56907033981814,-111.72947804385997,40.56996966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121546939","area_id":"30PJ9TbSXGKFcemMLwQc8Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.73066195614004,40.56907033981814],[-111.72947804385997,40.56907033981814],[-111.72947804385997,40.56996966018187],[-111.73066195614004,40.56996966018187],[-111.73066195614004,40.56907033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:27.889Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:35.974Z"}
