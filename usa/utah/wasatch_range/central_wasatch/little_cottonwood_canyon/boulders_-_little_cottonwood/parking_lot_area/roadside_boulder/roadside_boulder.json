Stand start and throw left to the first shot hole.  Slap the arête with your right and then throw to the next shot hole.  First half is pretty easy.  Use the undercling with your left, slap the arête with your right, get a high left foot and throw for the third shothole.  From here on up felt like the crux.  Smear as high as you can and either hit the fourth shot hole or the undercling/side pull.  Good topout (there's a bolt on top if ya need to toprope it).\n\nThe only downside is that the face is pretty dirty.  Will hopefully clean up with more traffic.
