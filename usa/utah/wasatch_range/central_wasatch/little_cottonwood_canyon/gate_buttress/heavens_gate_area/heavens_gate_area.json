The beginning is mega easy slab with a few chicken heads and plenty of sizeable divots.  The last two bolts go out onto a slab arete make up the crux.  Still easy but it might give a little shaky leg to an inexperienced slab climber or a new leader.  Great first time lead for someone who was the follower on schoolroom.","protection":"The route has about 6 bolts to 2 bolt anchor. The first four bolts are close together. You can skip a couple.","location":"This route exists at the top of schoolroom.  There is a rap anchor at the top of Schoolroom this climb goes up to the right.
