A #2 Camalot perfectly protects the flake transition.\n\nPitch 2 - 5.7 Awkward Chimney - Calling this a chimney is almost misleading. It is more like a offwidth crack with plenty of holds inside and outside the crack so that you never have to use offwidth technique. The pitch goes directly up the wall out ten feet from the large dihedral on the left. There is a thin crack to the left the offwidth that takes good protection or use the crack at the back of the offwidth.

Bell, C. Giddings, A. Kelner, 1958).  During our ascent, we noticed a fast-approaching storm cloud to the southwest, prompting us to sit tight on the prominent ledge atop the second pitch, nearly 2/3 the way up the wall.  While searching for a possible escape, we discovered two pitons in a shallow corner--along the most logical line of least resistance--and quickly realized that we'd stumbled upon the virtually-forgotten FA line.  One of the pins--a perfectly preserved, soft-iron ring angle--fell out with barely a touch, and so we decided to return the relic to the first ascensionists--if they were still around...\n\nIn the end, the weather proved uneventful and we finished the final pitch to the summit.
