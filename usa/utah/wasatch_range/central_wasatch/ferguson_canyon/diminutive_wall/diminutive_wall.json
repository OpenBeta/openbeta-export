Crimp on a slab-- over nothing-- passing the first bolt to a \"rest\" at an undercling; fiddle with some small pieces of gear then carry on remembering to breathe. From here move up and left over sketchy territory making sure not to skip any opportunities to place anything! Heading up and slightly left pull off some delicate moves to gain a solid stance. From this point, eye up the head wall, commit to a few awkward moves, and grab a\n\nthank-you\n\nhold. Clip the last bolt and fire the bouldery top out.
