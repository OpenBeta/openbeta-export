The first bolt can be clipped from the bomber handjam below the roof.  Very hard to clip second bolt, I clipped it from above after the crux. A purple Metolius TCU can be placed in a little slot below the top.  Bolt anchors on top.  With a 70m rope you can rap to the ground from the top.\n\nSome stoppers and TCUs might be handy for the belay anchor at the start of the tower pitch.","location":"On the\n\nWatchtower Proper\n\n.  Shares the same start as\n\nBats in the Belfry\n\nbut continues straight up the north side of\n\nThe Watchtower\n\n.  There are several approach pitch options from the ground.  Alternately, one can downclimb around from the top (easy 4th class)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"tNBbVz7PUj6WvTKQFFRqvQ==","name":"Faultline Variation","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Les Ellsion and Ken Speirs, 1983","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.77912,40.61337]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"106026599","mp_crag_id":"106632721","climb_id":"tNBbVz7PUj6WvTKQFFRqvQ==","areaRef":"W4d05RMwUEST9Ki1x2RA7g=="},"content":{"description":"This climb is a great way to beat the crowds chumming around\n\nExtreme Unction\n\nand is an excellent exit to a day in Ferguson.

Avoid the standard Ferguson guano pile and head for the obvious vertical cleft.

A good mix-up to the Ferguson standards.  Save some gas from your 13th lap on Unction... the steep section is a surprising pump.","protection":"Standard rack.
