With some interesting moves, you gain an even larger, sandy ledge where the dihedral begins.  From here, the climb sews up nicely, making for a speedy ascent.  It is more of a face climb here than a crack climb.  This route may have gotten its name from some of the loose rock that surprises your belayer.  The crux is a small roof pull (5.7) followed by a short traverse to the Heart Attack (5.4) exit.  If you don't figure out the moves here, you might mumble something about bags full of sand.  Note: the Ruckman guide rates Meteor Shower as 5.8.","protection":"Standard rack, doubles of red and gold camalots are nice.  A #4 camalot protects the crux.
