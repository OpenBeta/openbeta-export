Climb with confidence, this route leaves little room for error.\n\nStart in the center of the\n\nGallant Wall's\n\nleft face. Very alert climbing over a tricky face gains a hidden pin set behind a two foot wide ledge. From here a delicate and committing traverse left allows another stance at a bolt. Next, a couple of thin slab moves on an attention demanding arete eventually get you to a rest at a separation in the wall. At this point, the final two pins become visible. Continue climbing what may be the crux past cool crystal dikes. Top out and walk to the anchor.\n\nScandinavian Tuna\n\nis an adventurous way to \"test the waters\". The route has tough climbing between good rests. This is an excellent way to warm up to the steeper routes on the wall as well as test your psyche for live-wire climbing.","protection":"Three pins and a bolt.

Then there are these stretchy stems at the crux that make your pants split!  It gets narrow fast, and you start to squeeze a little, but a bomber wrist lock bails you out and deposits you on a sloping ledge.  A short crack guards the top.  Here, wide hands or narrow fists supplement fantastic foot jams.  The rock here is gritty and it exfoliates a steady stream; however, the rock instills more confidence than you would first imagine.","protection":"A selection of nuts and cams to a #2 camalot should suffice.
