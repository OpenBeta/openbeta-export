You'll be riding high above the Wasatch on this one! This climb has the most \"big wall\" feel of any climb I have done in the Wasatch. With some low angle approach pitches starting from the lowest apron of Middle Bell, all varieties of climbing up rope stretching pitches are encountered until reaching the upper apex tower pinnacle. Plan on a long day, it doesn't seem to be an exaggeration to call this a Grade IV.\n\nI had long looked at this line, yet though seemingly striking and obvious, history was lacking. A two bolt belay appears under the dihedral pitch on page 399 of the Ruckman Guide. In conversations with Les Ellison after finding ancient bolts in certain sections on the wall, we learned of an unreported 60's ascent by Jeff Lowe. His route, typically, was long, bold, and ahead of its time.\n\nPitch #1: From the lowest point on Middle Bell, climb weaknesses past some bulges through a swath through bushes to a two-bolt belay. 5.5, 25m.\n\nPitch #2: Continue straight up using the bush trimmings as markers to another two-bolt belay ledge. 5.6, 30m.\n\nPitch #3: Follow a groove/crack to a nice ledge and two-bolt belay immediately under the first prominent roof. 5.5, 33m.\n\nPitch #4: Climb a hand crack, up a steep shallow corner passing an old two-bolt hanging belay to a 3-bolt belay ledge. 5.10, A0, 40m.\n\nPitch #5: Climb out left, surmount a flake and gain more ground up the wild and steep groove/flake system. The Lowe route continues right up these grooves. WW moves more directly up slightly trending left at this point past bolts to the \"railroad tracks\", a pair of thin cracks that lead to the  base of the Great Dihedral. 5.9, A1. 58m.\n\nPitch #6: Layback up the wide right facing corner to hands, eventually moving left to a two-bolt belay ledge. The only crack of its kind in the Wasatch? 5.9+, 56m.\n\nPitch #7: Climb directly above the belay to the left arete of the tower pinnacle. Follow more than 13 bolts and fixed protection up the slab to a 3-bolt belay. This pitch may likely be the only entirely new and independent pitch from the Lowe route. 5.10, A0. 55m.\n\nPitch #8: Scamper the final moves up the decomposed rock past a drilled piton to the tower's tiny top. A drilled piton was added to Lowe's single anchor found here. 5.5, 2m.\n\nRappel the route.","protection":"QDs and slings. Camalots from C3 to #5. An RB or hook. A good number and variety of thin pitons, though this may go clean in subsequent ascents. This might be a candidate for a free ascent, but I suspect it might be 5.13 or so steep slab climbing. If a strong free climber would like to add a few bolts to avoid the nailing of the \"railroad tracks\" and make this feasible, great idea!....go for it. If done as an aid climb, please do not add bolts. All belays are bolted. All bolts used are at least 3/8\" x 3\". Many 1/2\". Two 60m ropes are recommended. Helmets....should be obvious but just saying.","location":"Hike up Bells Canyon and approach Middle Bell as for Arm and Hammer.

Easily pick this route out by looking for the obvious continuous dihedral which goes through 2 huge roofs. Good rock quality is found for the first 2 pitches, but it gets much worse after passing the Arm and Hammer exit.\n\nP1) Incredible roof traverse pitch.  This pitch is 3-star quality, and has good rock.  Easily climb up to the monster roof, then traverse the roof right for 40 feet of fun climbing.  A set of chain anchors ends this pitch immediately after finishing the roof, or link with the second pitch. (5.7)\n\nP2) Squeeze.  Good rock, but this is an unpleasant squeeze chimney.  Grunt up this passing 3 old bolts on the right face.  The crack can be somewhat protected with a #4 camalot.  Of the 3 bolts, the first looks like a nail with a wingnut attached, the second has a hanger, and the 3rd is bashed into the rock (and completely unusable).  The first can be used if slung with a small stopper. This pitch ends at a nice ledge with a 3 bolt anchor, or can be combined with pitch 1.
