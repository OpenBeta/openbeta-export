Starts on the the far east corner of the boulder (sit start) and traverses along the arete until you reach a oval shaped large grey stone I nick named the rhino horn, It may be possible to keep climbing along the arete until you reach the far side of the stream  but the rock looks sketchy so I usually just top out there.","protection":"To protect this route completely it could take up to 5 pads and a lot of work making a stick platform to keep your pads from being directly in the stream. This climb is all about having a good spotter who's willing to stand in the steam as you climb","location":"North side of Lange's Boulder.
