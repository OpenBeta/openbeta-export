The moves are easy but it's a cool setting and the top offers a great view of SLC. I learned how to climb by soloing this route so it holds a special place in my heart despite the long hike for easy rock.  There is protection to be had but it's easiest to walk around and set a TR. The route is named after my dog who attempted to follow me up on a solo. I got up about 15' and looked to see she was five feet behind me!","protection":"finger to hand size cams and nuts.
