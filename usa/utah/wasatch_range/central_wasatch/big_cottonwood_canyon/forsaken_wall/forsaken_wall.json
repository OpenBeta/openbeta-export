Given the route’s mystery, the “FA” and \"real\" name remain unknown until the FA party steps up.  The bolts seem to be in good shape, and are fairly close together; but it would be comforting to learn the length of the studs if anyone might know.   Big kudos to the original developers for their vision and obvious hard work in equipping the route, and apologies if any offense has been taken.","protection":"Draws.
