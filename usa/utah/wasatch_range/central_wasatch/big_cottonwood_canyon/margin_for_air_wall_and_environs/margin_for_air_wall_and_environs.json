I have made it past the pin before the crux, but I don't think I've actually made it to the crux yet.  I fell once on a green camalot, then again on a red camalot higher up.  I took two falls on a #3 camalot past the pin, then tried to protect the next sequence with a #00 C3.  It tore out when I fell again, and I whipped upside-down and injured my heel.  Did I mention that I got stung by a wasp?  My first epic!  Needless to say, this route is continuously difficult, extremely technical, airy, exposed, long, and worth an approach twice as arduous.  Set up a belay on the shale layer and climb over a slabby face towards the bushes above the flake.  Follow the crack up and to the left around an airy bulge, and another airy bulge, and another airy bulge.  Clip a pin next to a hollow sounding flake and climb through another airy bulge.  The Ruckman guide indicates that the crux is right after this section through a steep crack (I didn't make it that far).  Once the crux is finished, you have two options, continue following the crack, or climb diagonally right to the top of the wall and set up a gear belay for your second.","protection":"Standard rack, doubles recommended.  I saw one fixed pin.  No anchors at the top.","location":"Start on top of the shale layer to the left (North) of the bolt line and the flake.

There is an obvious low angle ridge that you follow up through scrub oak and low angle quartzite slabs. Ditch pack and gear up directly below the last facing dihedral.  Climb 100 feet or so of easy 5th class terrain until you can setup a belay at the base of the corner where there are 2 pitons. Walk off and down to the west.
