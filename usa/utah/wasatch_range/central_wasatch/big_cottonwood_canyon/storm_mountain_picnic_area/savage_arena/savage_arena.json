The Ruckmans give this one 3 stars, who are generally right on, and this one is no exception. I'm not a big fan of writing word for word what the book says about a climb, but look this one up as it is a classic one liner.\n\nEnjoy a few jugs, but mostly solid incut edges with a few crimps and cracks up a slightly overhanging face. The crux wasn't super tricky, but its a pumpy climb for sure.","protection":"5 bolts+ 2 bolt anchor protect this one, and if you see the Ruckmans topo, the bolting is not excessive.  AKA, fairly spaced out. I like my bolts a bit closer together than this one offers. Bolts 1 and 2 are no problem, but getting to bolt 3 is quite the mental crux. I felt like it was 12 feet or so, and your only 20+ feet up at that point. I would highly suggest not falling here. The crux comes at bolt 4, then bolt 5 is again spaced, and oddly 5 feet below the anchors. If it were me, I'd add one more bolt but I'm a heretic, and maybe that's why the Ruckmans like this one, because it does require some mental tenacity. I have none.","location":"This classic starts just left of a big triangular section of lower angle rock and right of a chossy crack section that is, adequately named,  \"Choss-a-go-go\"."},"__v":0},{"_id":"iy/4C5BUXcOt8iGuimlx4w==","name":"Choss-A-Go-Go","yds":"5.11","grades":{"yds":"5.11","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Goddard 92","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.74492,40.62508]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107594394","mp_crag_id":"107594366","climb_id":"iy/4C5BUXcOt8iGuimlx4w==","areaRef":"SIP1MqZFXny6zR6f5qLCcQ=="},"content":{"description":"Not the best climb I've ever done, but as its right next to Savage Dance I did it as a warm up of sorts. The overall quality of the route is quite fun. Climb up through the bottom loose section to reach the first bolt, then enjoy more face climbing to the top. Book doesn't give a letter to the 5.11. Felt b'ish.","protection":"3 bolts+2 bolt anchor plus some gear required. The bottom of the route looks a bit chossy and loose, which it is, which is probably why the Ruckmans gave this one an R. I didn't give it an R because I got two decent pieces in that I felt OK about prior to clipping the first bolt, and its not really hard climbing. I used a #3 camalot and a small blue tcu. Bring a few cams with you in case you like one placement better then the others.","location":"Obvious blocky/chossy looking rock up through a hole thing to a 3 bolt face climbing endeavor."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,e838736e-03de-5522-b170-850c7ffcb2ac,26a193ca-cb5e-5423-8ead-6db185433cfb,d31824ba-5b3d-5e76-bbbf-9ea2b7729f9f,4883f532-a645-5e7c-bacd-1e9fe6a2c271","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Central Wasatch","Big Cottonwood Canyon","Storm Mountain Picnic Area","Savage Arena"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.74492,40.62508]},"bbox":[-111.74551244829466,40.62463033981813,-111.74432755170531,40.62552966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107594366","area_id":"SIP1MqZFXny6zR6f5qLCcQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:23.681Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:18.634Z"}
