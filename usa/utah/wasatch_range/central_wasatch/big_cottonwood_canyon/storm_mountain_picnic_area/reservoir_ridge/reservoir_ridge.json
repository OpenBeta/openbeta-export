(See picture.)  The approach is okay, head up the gully that is the descent of the full Reservoir Ridge route.

Pro is plentiful until you get to the very last section before the anchor.  However, now that there is a new sling anchor, you may be able to clip the anchor without having to climb up the last slippery section.\n\nTwo descent options:  You are able to climb up and through the chimney downclimbing the gully of your choice on the east side.
