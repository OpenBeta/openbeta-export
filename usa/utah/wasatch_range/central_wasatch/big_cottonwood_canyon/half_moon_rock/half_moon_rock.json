Angling rock that leans the wrong way forces you into good footwork.  After you gain some height, utilizing the arete will ease the pump.  However, this is where some of the looseness exists.  After reaching the top traverse over to the chains.  Again, looseness is prevalent on the top of this route.  Beware!!!  Stay off the arete to make it a harder route.  Watch the swing off, if you happen to fall as the seconding climber.","protection":"4 draws and 2 more for the chains.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,e838736e-03de-5522-b170-850c7ffcb2ac,26a193ca-cb5e-5423-8ead-6db185433cfb,d524a570-705f-59ca-aede-ac43d5c3afab","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Central Wasatch","Big Cottonwood Canyon","Half Moon Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.789,40.6193]},"bbox":[-111.78959239703092,40.61885033981814,-111.7884076029691,40.61974966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105739751","area_id":"1SSlcHBfWcqu3qxD1cOvqw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:24.257Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:49:04.531Z"}
