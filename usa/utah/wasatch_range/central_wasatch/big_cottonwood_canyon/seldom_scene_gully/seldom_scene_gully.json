This route starts up the easy slab, right of this arete, to two bolts, and then progresses to a fun flake.  The crux is low and very tricky.  The upper face is consistent and doesn't let up.  The main problem with this route was a bit of loose rock from the 2nd bolt to the fun part of the flake.  One key handhold flexed, cracked, and spat out pieces of rock when we pulled on it, yet that was the only way could see to do it.  Bring a helmet.","protection":"2 bolts start this route off, and small to medium gear will protect the middle to the top.  The middle was the most specific.
