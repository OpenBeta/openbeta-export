This route is no different.\n\nBoulder up the ramp to a shallow weakness in the headwall. The headwall is the crux (5.10) as there is scant pro albeit a small TCU placement along a vertical flake midway up. If you blow it, good chance that the landing on the ramp below will be hard.  At the top one can reach a bomber crack that takes good pro. Use a long sling as the route now cuts off to the right on very positive holds (5.10). Above lies a very nice layback crack that leads to a short dihedral (5.7). The ramp adjacent to the lieback crack can be slick.","protection":"Small cams up to 1.5\"","location":"See the topo photo"},"__v":0},{"_id":"dPPhm61uWS+qd5iwmDB33g==","name":"Calamity Jane","yds":"5.10a/b","grades":{"yds":"5.10a/b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Allen Sanderson September 2007","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.789,40.6193]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"106242307","mp_crag_id":"106242255","climb_id":"dPPhm61uWS+qd5iwmDB33g==","areaRef":"w9u1vsJyXW2tNAS8S3oLGw=="},"content":{"description":"Drop down and around to the right from the other three climbs.
