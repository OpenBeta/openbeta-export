After the first three bolts the angle and climbing ease considerably, although, the climbing is still fun after the third bolt. Good, fun route. I felt the route was a bit easier than the rating it has been given. Best of the two routes on the wall. This one starts out very steep and then eases up. It is the leftmost route (northern most route) on the upper ambush wall.","protection":"Standard rack of quickdraws will suffice. Ends at chains. Well protected climbing.","location":"Follow the directions to ambush wall. As you are facing the lower ambush wall walk up and left. You will pass a steep 5.11d on your right as you walk up past the ambush wall. Continue on up the short but steep trail until the upper wall becomes visible on the hikers right.
