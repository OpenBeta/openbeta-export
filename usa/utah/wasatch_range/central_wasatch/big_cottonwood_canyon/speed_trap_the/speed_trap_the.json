A very pumpy climb that I felt like I was doing on my side.\n\nThe route starts climbing to the shelf with guano on it right of the lower 2 bolts. It clips the bolt off the guano ledge, and then the bolt at the 10 'o clock position.  The third bolt is just right of the arete and the fourth is on the south face.  All the routes on this wall share either one bolt or more, so it is kind of confusing.","protection":"2 bolts atop and 4 draws for the climb. Bring medium runners for the anchors as they are placed poorly.  Also, careful with a top-rope, as the rope can get wedged into a crack rather easily.  Then you might get hung up on the wall.
