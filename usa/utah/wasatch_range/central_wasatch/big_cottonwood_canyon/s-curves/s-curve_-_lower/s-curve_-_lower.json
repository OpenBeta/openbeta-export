They share anchors.  A nice climb with a big pull at the beginning.  Very enjoyable roof climb.  The climbing eases up, later on.  This is the reason that I only gave it 1 star.  The roof begs 2 stars, just not a consistent enough climb.  Do yourself a favor and do this climb.","protection":"4 draw for the route plus 2 for the chain anchors","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,e838736e-03de-5522-b170-850c7ffcb2ac,26a193ca-cb5e-5423-8ead-6db185433cfb,eb6d7eeb-8936-5751-baf9-38493db90788,7e3f1674-8aa1-58ad-9aac-d350ac252bbd","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Central Wasatch","Big Cottonwood Canyon","S-Curves","S-Curve - Lower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":5,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":4,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":3,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":3,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":5,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":16,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":9,"advanced":7,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":10,"advanced":8,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.72201,40.63387]},"bbox":[-111.72260252628321,40.633420339818144,-111.72141747371678,40.634319660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105739374","area_id":"fj8WdIqhWK2arNNQrCUrvQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.72260252628321,40.633420339818144],[-111.72141747371678,40.633420339818144],[-111.72141747371678,40.634319660181866],[-111.72260252628321,40.634319660181866],[-111.72260252628321,40.633420339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":21,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:23.683Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:52.467Z"}
