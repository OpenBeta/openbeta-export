Lifeline comes close to Crossing Over at this point so dont get sucked right onto the traverse of Crossing Over. Continue up the small right facing corner/notch. Some climbers may want to place a small cam between the two bolts here. After pulling over the small notch, follow the crack right, then up. The crack goes about 30-40 feet without bolts so you will need the pro. Dont forget about your second, if they fell after unclipping the last bolt before the crack they would swing over 15-20 feet. Its easy ground but  At the end of the crack you will find 2 more bolts before the anchor.
