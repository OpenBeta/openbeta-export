Choose between the left variation that climbs past a bolt through a reachier face or follow the flake system to the right.  Either way, a short and sweet crux awaits as the routes diverge.  An additional crux rewards those choosing the bolted line, which protects a continuance of the jug haul from the start.  Delightful!","protection":"Standard rack.  RPs or brass essential, one quickdraw for the bolt.  The anchors can be shared with Jagged Edge (5.8). One is a rusty old buttonhead. The webbing was pretty old, so we added to it.  I have doubts about the R rating from the Ruckman guide, but I have yet to lead it, so I can't disagree.  It looks like it would sew up easily enough, but the pump factor would greatly increase due to the overhanging nature of the route.","location":"A winding crack slithers up the overhanging east face of the Wavebreak Wall, just a few feet from the Jagged Edge arete.

This is heady for a 5.8 lead, mostly due to the shallow, thin and/or irregular placements.  With a little creativity, this does not have to be runout.  There are ample rests along the route and good feet will get you through the thin crack or crimps crux on the right side of the most vertical section near the top.  Fun route and a great warmup for Wave Break (5.11a R) next door.","protection":"Standard rack and a quickdraw for the lone piton mid-route.  I used small brass to a #3 Camalot.
