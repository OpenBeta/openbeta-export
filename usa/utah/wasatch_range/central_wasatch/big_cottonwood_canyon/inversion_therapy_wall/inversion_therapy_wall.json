A very stout start leads to an extremely thin section then into overhanging 5.11 climbing to a chain belay about 70 feet up. From there an optional second long pitch of about 5.11 ascends to the top. The wall to the climbers left would offer several steep and difficult sport climbs.","protection":"Bolted the entire way. Lower off from the first belay. If you climb the second pitch you need 2 ropes to get off or walk down hill to the little short section between this route and Inversion therapy and there is a 2 bolt rap station that gets you to the ground.","location":"Uphill from Inversion Therapy beyond a shorter section of rock to the right hand aspect of the main wall.

After an initial hard move (stick clip is nice) the route backs off slightly as it turns the first roof via a large crack. After the 5th bolt it moves up and left tackling the center of the overhang passing another 6 or 7 bolts. The crux is not any single move but instead it is the pump Â– no let up until you reach the chains. Lowering off you will be 40 feet from the wall.","protection":"Bolts - 12 or so plus chains.
