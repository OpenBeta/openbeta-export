You begin by placing your pad on the west side of the boulder, the side facing towards the valley. The start holds are two jugs at the top that you can either jump to or hold a side crimper to then make the jump. From hold onto those two jugs, smear your right foot and heel hook with your left foot. Hand holds at the top are great for getting comfortable with heel hooking.","protection":"1 pad.","location":"The west side of the boulder has the steepest feature of the whole boulder. I found the large jugs at the top and thought there must be something here that can be climbed.
