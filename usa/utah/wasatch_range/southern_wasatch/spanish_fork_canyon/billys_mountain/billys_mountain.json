It follows a finger crack up to an overhanging section where it turns into really difficult slab climbing. Although this climb is relatively chossy, it is really fun. It incorporates most forms of climbing, so that is another thing good about it. The crux is at the last bolt. With a little bit of analyzing, it shouldn't be too difficult. The only problem with this route is that it is a little runout, so be prepared for that. If you are a good climber and you're looking for something surreal to climb, I would recommend this route.","protection":"6 bolts to chains","location":"After parking, walk along the barb-wired fence until you see a rock that will allow you to cross with relative ease. From there, route-find directly towards the waterfall. Once you get to the waterfall, it is about 15 feet to the left."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,b037c296-e68f-57e1-b9b0-29e6e393f181,09168432-93c0-5df8-ad25-2fdeedf3944c,82ac257b-47a8-5eba-97b9-d8eada56ac89","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Southern Wasatch","Spanish Fork Canyon","Billy's Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.49,40.01435]},"bbox":[-111.49058711308314,40.013900339818136,-111.48941288691684,40.01479966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117039328","area_id":"gqwle0eoXrqXudjq2lasiQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.49058711308314,40.013900339818136],[-111.48941288691684,40.013900339818136],[-111.48941288691684,40.01479966018186],[-111.49058711308314,40.01479966018186],[-111.49058711308314,40.013900339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:51.983Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:30.824Z"}
