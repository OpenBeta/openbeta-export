Once past this bulge continue up on positive edges and pull a small roof, arriving at a large grassy ledge with 2 bolts for anchors.

Continue up through steep exposed bulges with smaller holds until you arrive on some ledges with ring anchors just below the summit.\n\nWalking off to the NW towards the saddle of Trilogy Buttress and down to the West is the easiest way off of the route.
