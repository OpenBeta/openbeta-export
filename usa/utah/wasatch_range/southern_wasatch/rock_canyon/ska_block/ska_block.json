The climb starts with your left hand on a good sidepull and your right hand way out right on the arete. Do a move or two to get up to the nice horizontal jug. Clip the second bolt from there. Do a heel hook and make a move out to the right arete. There is a good undercling just over the arete that you can't really see while you're climbing. Grab the undercling, get your feet up, and clip the third bolt. The redpoint crux follows. Use slopey holds to kind of mantel up and move right onto the west face of the Ska Block. Make a move or two and clip the last bolt on Ruder Than You.\n\nBe careful on this climb at two parts: when you're about to clip the third bolt (a fall with slack out means that you might slam into the jagged rock thing that juts out at the bottom) and after moving around the arete onto the west side of the formation. A fall there before you clip might also get you close to the jagged rock (although I fell there a couple times and missed it).
