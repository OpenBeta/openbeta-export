The start is fun limestone pockets, changing to good, positive holds. The crux comes after crossing the crack (after clipping the 5th bolt, see photo).\n\nThe rock on\n\nSpank the Monkey\n\nseemed quite a bit better than the route next to it (\n\nVengeance is Mine\n\n). The pocket area near the bottom is quite solid, and most of the holds on the left side of the crack seem good. There was, however, one fairly large semi-detached flake that looks like it would be a great jug, but it is a bit loose.\n\nThe Ruckman guide shows this route as completely separate from\n\nVengeance is Mine\n\nuntil the anchors (and that is how I show it in the topo photo). However, it is a bit run out after the last bolt and if you fell near the top you would almost certainly hit a ledge below, which would be a bad thing. Fortunately it is easy to clip the last bolt on\n\nVengeance is Mine\n\n.","protection":"7 bolts to chain anchors with quick links.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,b037c296-e68f-57e1-b9b0-29e6e393f181,0f0d1cb5-366f-59ca-93d4-ebb0b62da19b,d36b84a0-9e85-5bac-a846-68bf1561f15f","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Southern Wasatch","Rock Canyon","Upper Bug Barn Dance Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.6138,40.2656]},"bbox":[-111.61438928817174,40.26515033981813,-111.61321071182827,40.266049660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105799320","area_id":"02uEoJ6FW6yoRmi/FWHxXw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:50.597Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:47.746Z"}
