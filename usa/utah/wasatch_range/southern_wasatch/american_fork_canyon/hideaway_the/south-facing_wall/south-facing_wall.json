Nothing quite compares to the aesthetic beauty of the rock, and complexity of the movement required to put this thing down.\n\nThis route is in your face from the get-go. Start off with a hard boulder problem utilizing very small crimps. I've seen it done two ways; it's probably the same difficulty either way. Make big, powerful, dynamic moves in the dihedral until it's possible to move out left on very positive pockets. After a few hard traversing moves, a big deadpoint to a positive finger-jug leads to an ok rest. Catch your breath. A few more moves on small holds guard the final jug rail where the chains are easily clipped.","protection":"6 bolts to chains","location":"This is the first route you get to from the approach trail.
