It is tenuous and insecure for most of its 50 ft. There may only be 3 holds on the whole thing! The crux is at the 3rd bolt- climb a ways right of the bolt line to slap up the sloping ramp. The rock on this wall reminds me of that in the Merciless Onslaught/Something Wild area of Cannabis crag. This smooth and minimally textured rock offers surprisingly little for your feet. The routes weaves and shamefully flirts a little too close  with the corner to the left in the middle section. It also can feel like it is coated in a fine dust/ lichen (despite brushing) that makes friction troublesome.
