The crux is getting past the large chalked-up undercling - right hand to a good crimper, throwing left and pulling past the triangle-shaped sloper to a large bomber crimp that you can match on.  A high right foot definitely helps here (use the crimper you used a right hand on above the undercling).  Throw right to an awesome pinch, backstep your left foot, throw left to the large side-pull, and pull over the top leading with your right leg/foot.
