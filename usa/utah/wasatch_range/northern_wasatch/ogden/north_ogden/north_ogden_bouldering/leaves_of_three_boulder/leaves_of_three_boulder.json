The name for the problem is derived from the fairly extensive patch of poison ivy (T. rydbergii) that inhabited the base of the wall (It has been removed). However, pay attention to any small plants that might be growing in the area. The problem begins on two good holds under the small roof, and moves right as a lip traverse for a few moves, then climbs straight up through a couple of small holds to nice jug finish.","protection":"Several bouldering pads are useful.","location":"Refer to the map, and the aforementioned descriptions.
