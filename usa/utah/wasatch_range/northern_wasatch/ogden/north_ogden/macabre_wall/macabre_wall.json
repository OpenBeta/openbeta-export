Build belays wherever you're comfortable\n\nPitches 1 and 2 (~130 feet each): Easy face climbing with some strenuous roof moves involving only 2-3 hard moves then back to easy face. I usually belay for the top of pitch 1 at a long narrow ledge about 50-60 feet above the first roof and sometimes relocate belay to the just below the 2nd roof. I usually build a belay for the top of the second roof at a stance about 20 feet above it.\n\nThis page refers to the 5.10 roof on pitch 1.\n\nPitch 3: really long 5.5 climbing straight up above belay then traverse about 40-50 feet right, then back up the corner to belay just below the FOOPs roof hand crack. Belay takes finger sized gear up to 1.5\".\n\nPitch 4: FOOPs roof (5.11+). Jam up this awesome roof crack through overhanging #2 camalots hand jams then traverse out the roof dihedral through wide hand jams on glassy feet. This roof is 15 feet of overhanging hand jams. Usually just belay on top with whatever gear is left.\n\nRelocate the belay to the right side of the obvious Macabre Roof.\n\nPitch 5: The piece de resistance! Follow the flake on the roof past some hand jams through a block then move up and right through V-shaped notch. There is a piton about the point when you go straight up. Always be suspect of fixed pins, especially in quartzite. Belay at a good stance at a fixed nut supplementing it with thin hand and finger sized gear.\n\nPitch 6: continue up 5.6 corner until it forces you to skirt it to the left.","protection":"1-2 sets of cams from fingers to wide hands and a set of nuts. If doing FOOPs roof, it is helpful to have two #3 camalots or a #3 and #4.","location":"Middle of the Macabre Wall. Start hiking from the trailhead across from the Catholic church and make your way from dirt turnaround area on the canal road up and left alongside some broken brown band of gneiss.  The descent is a hike off to the north trying to locate the descent gully (2nd class) between the Macabre Wall and the Nature Center Wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"5WESVakIUOKESzbEefpApg==","name":"Macabre Wall I","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Lowes","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.94134,41.27493]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106879593","mp_crag_id":"106879581","climb_id":"5WESVakIUOKESzbEefpApg==","areaRef":"XJxqbjiYXo6KJZN59k3X+Q=="},"content":{"description":"The 5.10 roof is the crux about 50' off the deck.
