It's kind of a weaker, Ogden quartzite version of the Coffin Roof in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Basically, it's a boulder problem 60 feet off of the deck.\n\nThis is located on what Robb calls the SR-71 part of the Nature Center Wall.  The roof is not that obvious until you're up close, or just know where to look. But once you are standing at the base of the descent gully which splits the SR-71 wall (and the only really gully to split the whole nature center wall) you can gaze the roof above you on the right wall of the gully.\n\nPitch 1: Really just a scramble approach. I don't think a rope or climbing shoes are required to get up to the base of the 10 foot dihedral that guards passage to the roof.  ~40 feet. Build a belay with some larger hand sized cams.\n\nPitch 2: Begin up the 5.9ish (it's been a few years since I climbed it) dihedral.  There will be a small awkward perch at the base of the roof atop this.  Here you can stuff in a few finger sized cams and try (strenuously) to stretch out and gander at the moves.  Step 2 of this: Pull hard some finger locks and edges. After surmounting the roof and making a few easy moves to the top of the wall. Down climb and down aid - No anchor - back to the belay atop pitch 1.","protection":"For pitch two.  A hand ful of finger sized cams and nuts.  A .75 (green) camalot to place above the roof and whatever cams the dihedral takes.
