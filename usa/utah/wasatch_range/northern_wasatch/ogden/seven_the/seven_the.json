Better left (more fun) as a Top Rope problem, though it has been climbed on lead.  If you do choose to lead it, realize that apparently perfect placements might rip out of the soft, fractured, crystalized cracks and fall at the lip may be bad.\n\nClimb up to the crack (easy), make some painful jams (hard), crank the lip (crux 1) and follow the crack up the face.  Two-thirds of the way, you'll encounter another, more technical, crux.","protection":"Bring a looonngg cordelette for through over the lip on the bolts for the anchor.  This rock could easily saw the sheath off of your rope if you don't get it running clean enough.\n\nIf you choose to lead it, you'll need a couple of #1 and #2 BD Camalots and one each .5 and .75 in addition to draws and runners.","location":"Can't miss it if you find the Seven."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,87f2a278-0161-52ab-beef-ce3c57f03f73,a24448f6-6633-5c54-b897-6926136d491b,d0d887ac-4a70-5c59-9c6b-c24407fa6d8a","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Northern Wasatch","Ogden","Seven, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.92267,41.21288]},"bbox":[-111.92326774028491,41.21243033981815,-111.92207225971507,41.21332966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106958359","area_id":"0NiHrEpwXFmca8JEB/ptig=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:48.976Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:45.900Z"}
