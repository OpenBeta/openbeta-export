Again, traverse along the rim until the pictured location mentioned above.  About 80 feet of careful downclimbing (beware loose rock) leads to the top of a casual ramp/gully heads southwest and cuts across the upper portion of the southern aspect of the buttress.  This ultimately leads to a point near the base of \"Deathblock Dihedral.\"  From here, trend generally right, swithbacking or downclimbing when necessary to rejoin the approach trail at the base of the cliff."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,5f0ed4d8-ebb0-5e78-ae15-ba7f1b3b5c51,87f2a278-0161-52ab-beef-ce3c57f03f73,a24448f6-6633-5c54-b897-6926136d491b,5511b62d-8e91-50ac-b078-d8f9e5bb5cce","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Wasatch Range","Northern Wasatch","Ogden","Mezzanines, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":3,"label":"5.7"},{"count":2,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":13,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":6,"intermediate":5,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":6,"intermediate":5,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.93456,41.26348]},"bbox":[-111.93515820321542,41.263030339818144,-111.9339617967846,41.263929660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111959961","area_id":"VRG2LY6RUKyweNj55btczg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:48.976Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:45.927Z"}
