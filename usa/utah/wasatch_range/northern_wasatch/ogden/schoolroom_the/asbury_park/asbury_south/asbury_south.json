The route, like many other schoolroom lines, feels a little steeper than it looks.  Some of the finger locks and handjams are kind of painful and the feet on this one seem to disappear near the end. You can either climb easy ground to the left, under the roof, then work your way back right to the main splitter, or tackle the thin seam that leads directly into it.  If going up the seam, don't worry, there is a bomber hidden nut placement right in the middle.
