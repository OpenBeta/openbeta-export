If someone knows the correct name, let me know.\n\nAlso, this route was erroneously rated 12a in the Schoolroom pamphlet I put out. I believe it to be more like 5.11c.\n\nThis route is one of the longer offerings on Schoolroom.  It begins just left around the corner from \"No Talent Ass Clown,\" climbing the north face of the large dihedral for 40 feet until ledges are obtained then climbs the west facing wall above NTAC to the top.\n\nThe bottom half (north face) climbs up some thought provoking 10+/11- terrain.  The upper half provides the crux 5.11 section with close bolts.\n\nIt is possible to climb NTAC into the crux wall above, which I would think, would make the whole endeavor a letter grade easier (5.11b) though the crux is the same but the overall feel of the route would be one of less sustained attention. But take that for whatever it's worth. The whole rating stuff...is just personal opinion.","protection":"Don't remember. Take a number of draws. Probably 9.","location":"Right side of the Alcove.
