The route begins up on a ledge 15 feet up from the main ledge about 30 feet left of Tree Crack.  It is route #64 in Mike's schoolroom overview photo.\n\nBegin up a slightly overhanging bolted flake . The second bolt seems out of line to the right of the rest of the bolt, but this is where most people make a difficult mantle onto the flake system.  I'm tall, and have never successfully stuck that mantle, which I believe is kind of height dependent in favor of shorties, so I figured out a sequence that climbs directly up from bolt one to bolt three using a 1 finger crimp.  From there, climb through 20 feet via powerful moves, through thin crimps and micro edges for feet.  This sequence ends with a tall stab to close pockets at the 5th bolt.
