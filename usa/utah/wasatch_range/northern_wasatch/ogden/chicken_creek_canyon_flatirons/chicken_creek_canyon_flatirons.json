The bottom pitch is a bit overhanging and is broken up by a dirty ledge and even dirtier scramble, angling slightly to the left (Class 3 for maybe 20 ft).\n\nThe next several pitches are pretty wild and have a surprising amount of exposure for the area. Gradually follow the slabby, knife-edge arete through several pitches of easy fifth-class climbing. I thought there were a few 5.7 moves but I was in approach shoes so perhaps it’s easier. You can escape far left to a gully across the ‘Moccasins’ Slab if needed.\n\nProbably never going to be a popular area/route, but very secluded and actually some pretty fun climbing.","protection":"Trad rack.","location":"From the base of the flatirons locate the short (roughly 20 ft) slightly overhanging face to the right of “Moccasins” Slab. This is the beginning of the climb. It’s possibly to avoid this portion by climbing around this in a gully on either side. Follow the prominent, jagged arete through a series of broken dirty section.
