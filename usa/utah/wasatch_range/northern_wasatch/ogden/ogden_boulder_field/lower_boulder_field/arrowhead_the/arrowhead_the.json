Work your way up the arete until you make a small jump to a pinch.  From here top out to the right via a somewhat technical and scary mantle.\n\nFor the sit start, start on a decent undercling on the bottom left side of the face.  Slap to the arete, avoid the rock beneath you, and work your way up.  Top out the same as the stand start.\n\nAs far as I know, either start is considered a legitimate ascent of the boulder.  The sit start may be a little on the soft side for a V8, while the stand start feels pretty damn hard for an 8.  I also think the sit start loses a bit of quality due to the fact that the crux move for me was not dabbing on the rock.","protection":"Pad","location":"Overhanging west face of the Arrowhead"},"__v":0},{"_id":"98OBxwoDU9qM1UV9aX8WKg==","name":"North Slab","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"Old School","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.9273,41.22145]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"109843427","mp_crag_id":"108037788","climb_id":"98OBxwoDU9qM1UV9aX8WKg==","areaRef":"HB9Le5EeWiOP66D+Fc+WIA=="},"content":{"description":"A classic old school highball of the boulder field.
