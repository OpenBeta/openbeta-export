The book says it can be done in 1 or 2 pitches, but there was no obvious belay station, so I suggest cruising through in 1 pitch. The route has some loose, chossy holds and some loose pebble to cobble size rocks on it, so I advise both the climber and especially the belayer to wear helmets!  The climbing is easy and consistent at 5.5.  Protection is typical of Logan Canyon limestone: notoriously tricky to place solidly.  Luckily, spots for protection are numerous and hand holds abound.  Not a route to seek out in and of itself, but if you're up at Mullein land and have a trad rack with you, give it a shot.","protection":"A standard rack up to a #3 camalot was used.  Be sure to bring several 24\" runners to reduce rope drag (a killer on this route without them if you do it in one pitch). There are fixed chain anchors located just below the summit to the left.
