This bulge is the crux. Well protected by the second bolt. Move straight over the bulge.  You maybe tempted to move left a few feet but do not do that. This may lead you to the point where you could take a significant swing.  Once you’re past the bulge enjoy the mixed face and small cracks you encounter on the way to the top.  I’m sure this has been top roped  I know I TR this years ago.   First ascent is unknown,\n\nbolts placed and first lead 2019 and now there for your leading pleasure.","protection":"Bolts","location":"The bulge at the second bolt is the crux.
