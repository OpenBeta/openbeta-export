Climb your way out of the pit using crimps and slopers. Squat start right hand in small two finger incut and left hand on a slightly higher sloper. Use another crimp and sloper that lead you to a big toss to better holds up top, trending first left then back right eventually hitting the victory jug.\n\nNOTE: There is a largish block hold up near the top that is loose, I left this here because it exposes a larger flake that could be susceptible to breakage if too many people pull on it.
