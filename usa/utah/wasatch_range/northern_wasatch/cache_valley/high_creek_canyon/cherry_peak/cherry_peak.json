Fun outing with amazing views.  Protection is very sparse and not great.\n\nNote:  For most of this climb, a fall for the leader( and sometimes the second) would not be comfortable.  Given that you are far from medical help and you can't bail easily off the climb, don't fall.\n\nP1:  Climb up 100ish ft and traverse left 50ish ft to avoid the steeper stuff.  There is a good belay with a decent crack as the steepness tapers off.  5.7R 150'\n\nP2:  Start by pulling over the steeper stuff (5.7) and continue up wandering 4th class to a set of juniper trees and another steep section.  Build belay here.  5.7PG13 190'\n\nP3:  Pull another steep section (5.7, left of belay) continue up a ramp(right, avoiding the gully left) to more 4th class wandering.  Built a belay in a really large ledge with a crack below steeper stuff. 5.7R 150'\n\nP4:  Climb steeper 5th class rock up to a chimney.  On top of the chimney there is a large pine tree to build a belay.  5.7R 190'\n\nP5-6:  Wander up 4th class slabs.  You can throw in some fun 5th class in there too if you wander the right way.  There is a killer tree/crack/shady belay about half way up. 4th 300'","protection":"1 60 m rope. 1-2 sets of cams up to a 5.
