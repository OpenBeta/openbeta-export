Gear is possible between bolts 1&2, but the climbing is easy (I just ran it out). At the 2nd bolt, either move right and pull through a bulge/roof (likely the better option for fall potential) or climb up and left on a technical face. Both end up around the same difficulty. Continue up past another bolt to a follow a black dike feature that trends up and staying slightly left with some good holds in the weaknesses to a final bolt. Make a few more moves out hard right on a rail to the chains.\n\nThis route shares anchors with \"Professor Quirrell’s Tamborine\" which climbs past bolts further right on the arete.","protection":"4 bolts, 2 bolt anchor","location":"Up the middle of the west face of the North tower."},"__v":0},{"_id":"bBn8QpjzUZyvHso6mdzj1A==","name":"Quentin Quarantino","yds":"5.11b/c","grades":{"yds":"5.11b/c","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Nathan Nelson, FFA:","type":{"sport":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.87086,40.98094]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118714557","mp_crag_id":"118714527","climb_id":"bBn8QpjzUZyvHso6mdzj1A==","areaRef":"oiFFQcj/XmScjVzAhRkW8w=="},"content":{"description":"I might be biased, but I think this route is really good.
