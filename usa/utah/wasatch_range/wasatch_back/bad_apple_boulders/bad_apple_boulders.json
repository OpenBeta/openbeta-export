They are not so forced.\n\nThe main line, as far as I'm concerned, is to start sitting down and left. I used two thin crimps to start. Then fire up left hand to a thin tweaky crimp. Set your feet, and do a big iron cross out to the right to a cool sloper jug. Then finish on incut guano jugs to a nice topout.\n\nThere are two other obvious lines, which I will try to indicate on the photo, which are easier, but also worth doing.\n\nThe face is big enough that you could find more variations than on the upper boulder. Maybe there's even a nice dyno from low holds to the top? I didn't do that.\n\nMay have been first done by Sean Faulkner. I saw this one shared by him a couple years ago, but the page is gone now.
