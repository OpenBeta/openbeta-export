Climb up fun, hard-to-protect choss for a good rope length, weaving left and right to avoid some steeper, chossier sections. I left a knifeblade in a horizontal crack before one of the roofs. After topping out, walk right a few feet and belay there. A small angle piton was left fixed.\n\nNone of the pitches after the first require technical gear... and the first pitch could even be avoided by going up the snow gully to the left or scrambling up easier rock to the right.\n\nFrom the belay, unrope (stashing your rock gear would probably be a good idea, too) and walk up (west) the ridge until you see the low-angled 4th class rock as marked in the topo pic. Carefully cross the snowy gully and climb several hundred vertical feet of rock that gets easier the closer you get to the top. The actual summit of the peak is a 5 minute scramble to the south.","protection":"A few medium-sized nuts, small (C3 sizes) to hand-sized cams. Lots of slings.
