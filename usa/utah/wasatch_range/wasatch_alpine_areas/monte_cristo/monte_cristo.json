We did this in basically winter conditions and used ice axe and crampons to climb on the lower pitches, though the face was dry with some snow ledges encountered. We climbed in Mountain boots/crampons. Other seasons would facilitate using climbing shoes.\n\nI enter this ascent now, as Franklin has passed on as other fine alpinists have and he shared with me a deep love for alpine exploration at a time in the Wasatch when many people thought the place was \"climbed out\". Seems strange now, but still so many \"alpine routes\" in the late winter or spring still await.","protection":"We left a few pitons fixed, I remember. Nuts and cams would work well.","location":"Middle of the south face of the South Summit of Monte Cristo Peak just to the west of Superior Peak.
