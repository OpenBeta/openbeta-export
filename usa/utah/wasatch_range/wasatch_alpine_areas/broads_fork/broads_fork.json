Climbing amidst the cascading waterfalls on uncharacteristically clean (of Little) granite. If you follow the main couloir, you will end up at the saddle between East and West Twin Peaks, looking down into Broads Fork. It's a good way to spend a day, going up a route you've probably eyed on your way to Snowbird. There is some fun quartzite climbing up high, with the occasional snow field or chose pile thrown in for good measure.\n\nSummit post says it is 1.3 miles up. 4800' of elevation gain, which means a relentless angle.\n\nDescent: Glissade the route (if there is snow in the couloir). Otherwise it's probably easiest to head down the Broads Fork route.\n\nNote: This is not the Every Man's route. For the more casual, classic, and safe route, do the Broads Fork route. The Lisa Falls route is for people looking for something with more challenging route finding, more technical movement on rock, and minor bushwhacking.","protection":"Approach shoes, helmet, we brought piolets for glissading.","location":"Park at the Lisa Falls trail head, and walk up the trail.
