Work through a slightly tougher off-width to gain a good handcrack for 15 ft. of solid jams.  At a good stance the crack opens  up to an off-width with a bulge at the top (crux).  Place a not-so-inspiring cam (#2-#4 camalot range) at the bottom of the bulge and work through tough/awkward and exposed moves to gain the belay ledge.  Two stainless glue-ins up and to the left make the anchor.  There is an optional #2 camalot for a third piece.","protection":"Doubles of #2, #3, and #4 camalots as well as a #3.5 or equivalent.","location":"When on the road driving to the parking area you can see the route as a dark shadow/dihedral trending right to the saddle at the tallest part of the Western Battleship formation.  When walking the bluff it is the first and tallest clean crack you come to.  From the bottom it trends right and appears slightly low-angle."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,f94f3508-ac5a-5c67-8e49-892bcbbc412f,04720a37-1ac1-5d52-a1e2-8f22772eca82,8f8ea76d-3e96-558e-b0af-6c161f39e1ab","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","Northeast Utah","Vernal Area","Western Battleship"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.4441,40.594]},"bbox":[-109.44469217281629,40.593550339818144,-109.44350782718372,40.594449660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107626892","area_id":"j46nbT6WVY6wr2wWHznhqw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:20.321Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:13.990Z"}
