The Uinta Rock guidebook gives it a 5.7, but given the altitude (10,400 ft) I think it's fair to bump this to at least 5.8.  The cruxy section in the middle is a \"little\" steep but within two moves it's over.  We found a Diet Coke can on top of the route from 1986 so I'm guessing it doesn't see much action.\n\nThe route gets to a large ledge on top ideal for belaying/anchoring, but you can climb a deep flake to the right of the roof feature another 10 feet to the top.","protection":"A number of large horizontal cracks will take a variety of cams, nuts, etc.  Best not to use the vertical crack for placements as you will waste a lot of energy trying to place it instead of moving through to a better, easier stance.  No bolts or anchors.  We left a sling with a rap ring around a largish rock just below the top.","location":"The line runs to the right of an obvious roof at the top that you can see from your approach.  The route is to the left of Castle Lake if you are facing the wall.  You will have to hike across a boulder field/grassy area up to a big ledge above a short cliff and move left.  Rap from your own sling or down climb a nearby gully by traversing up and to the left and then down a series of ledges semi-hidden by a bunch of pine trees (easier to see this from below)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"OX91Vt3EVlicRyM8m8TGsg==","name":"Thor's Unhappy","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"Jeff Baldwin","type":{"trad":true,"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.511,40.7473]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106263643","mp_crag_id":"106263629","climb_id":"OX91Vt3EVlicRyM8m8TGsg==","areaRef":"81/sVSB8UNK2nfoAfJku1g=="},"content":{"description":"3 overhangs to get you pumped.

Expect lichen, looseness, and the occasional cool move.\n\nStart by scampering up a short vertical section to reach a wide grassy ledge (where I imagine you could belay if you wanted to pitch this thing out). Scramble up large stacked blocks to the base of a dihedral and tiptoe up to a roof, placing small gear on the outside of the wide crack and muttering obscenities about how lush the lichen is. Pull the roof and continue up the shallow dihedral aiming for the summit blocks. Look around for a while hoping to find fixed hardware. Give up, build a belay (multiple small pieces will work), bring up your second, walk off.\n\nWhen I did the route this spring I wasn't even sure I was on the right line until I spotted 2 #11 BD nuts side by side under a large loose block. Looks like a very optimistic party belayed and maybe even rapped off them? Holler if you want your small boat anchors back.","protection":"Single set from tiny to BD#3, nuts useful, runners mandatory. Be strategic with gear when you leave the grassy ledge or the rope drag monster will get you.\n\nNo fixed anchor, small placements abound at the top.","location":"Walk past every good looking route at Castle Lake to reach this thing. The only distinctive feature from the guidebook is a small roof on the headwall (not to be confused with another roof landmark which can help locate Wife and 2 Kids, another pile).\n\nWalk off to the West."},"__v":0},{"_id":"oCt4EzRVWHCONyVbTyagwA==","name":"London Bridges","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Jeff Baldwin, 2002","type":{"trad":true,"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.511,40.7473]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106712008","mp_crag_id":"106263629","climb_id":"oCt4EzRVWHCONyVbTyagwA==","areaRef":"81/sVSB8UNK2nfoAfJku1g=="},"content":{"description":"A fun mixed route with good good gear and good pulling.\n\nSolid for the grade, this route offers various techniques and varied terrain.
