(good camp sites) You can see the couloir on the approach. It borders the East Face on the North. Ascend steep forest, then meadow, then talus, to the couloir. Ascend the couloir on easy-moderate snow. (Ice axe and knowledge of it's use are highly recommended. Crampons might be needed if the slope is frozen.) Follow the easy N. Ridge on ledges on its W. side to the summit block. Follow ledges around the summit block to the S.E., and ascend on excellent quartzite. Beginners might want a rope at this spot. Early start recommended to avoid afternoon thunderstorms. This would NOT be a good route for large groups, due to potential for rockfall. Scoutmasters please take notice!","protection":"Ice axe. Consider crampons, short rope, skis. You may want extra foot wear for fording the river (three times each way, if I recall correctly).","location":"See above. The key to identifying the couloir is that it directly borders the East Face on the North, and reaches the N. Ridge at a notch.
