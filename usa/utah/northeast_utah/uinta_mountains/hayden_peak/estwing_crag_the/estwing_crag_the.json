Although the experience was very satisfying, the end product was a poorly protected route that none of us wanted to climb again. Subsequent ascents have seen the addition of several lead bolts as well as anchor bolts making for a fun and well protected climb in a very exposed position. It is often windy in this area.\n\nPitch 1\n\n: Begin off a boulder at the base of the route. Climb up and left following 3 bolts and into a right facing corner. Climb this corner up to a small roof and hand traverse to the right back to the arête. Jam up the short but wildly exposed hand and fist crack to a small belay ledge with a 2 bolt anchor. 5.10-, 80'.\n\nPitch 2:\n\nClimb up the hand crack in the steep corner system to the right of the belay. At the top of this corner make some moves to the left and gain a large ledge system. Ramble up the ledges to their highest point and locate a bolt on the wall above. Climb up passing a roof on its right side and negotiate some easy climbing on less than stellar rock. Belay on a large ledge. 5.10-, 100'.\n\nPitch 3\n\n: Gain the obvious ledge by climbing past 2 fixed pins, ascend the headwall via the right most crack system leading to the summit. Pumpy and exposed climbing with a bit of grittiness. 5.11-, 90.\n\nRappel the route or climb one more crappy pitch and walk off down the Hayden Couloir.","protection":"Single rack to a #4 Camalot, Doubles in the #.5 - #2 Camalot range.\n\n60 Meter rope.
