This is the belay ledge for the second pitch.  The second pitch travels up the water mark, featuring chossy climbing up easy terrain.  The last bolt is before an INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS chimney section which runs out to the anchors.  Use extreme caution on this section - it really needs to be cleaned up and the belayers will be avoiding flying rocks otherwise.  The second pitch is roughly 130', so rappelling off with a 70M rope is ill-advised.  Try rap'ing with the Dumpster Diver anchors or possibly avoid this adventure climb altogether until it gets safer.  PG13 for runout and falling rocks from rope drag and climbers.\n\nAs a side note, you can continue up bolts from the the belay ledge up an unknown route.
