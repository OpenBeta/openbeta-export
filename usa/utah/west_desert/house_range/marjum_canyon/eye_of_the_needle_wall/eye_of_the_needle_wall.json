It has a little bit of runout for a single pitch in the middle of nowhere. So if you plan on climbing it just make sure you’re a solid 5.9 climber. There are plenty of bomber holds but the route can be pretty reachy. Long consistant 5.9-5.10a climbing through the whole climb. Awesome warm up before climbing the eye.","protection":"I believe there is 8 bolts but there may be more so 10-12 quickdraws is more than sufficient.","location":"Find and locate the eye of the needle.
