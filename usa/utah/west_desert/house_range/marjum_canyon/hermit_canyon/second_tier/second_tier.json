The first pitch is about 115' and starts right off with a slab crux and moves into a hanging flake / layback, it then cruises up some moderate face climbing on perfect crimps. As you move up the bolts start to space out, and the upper crux is a heady bit of crimping that eases up to the first belay. 13 bolts on the first pitch.\n\nFrom the belay, the second pitch rises through a ramping corner, past two bolts, and mantles onto a ledge. It then moves up onto steeper terrain that finds a well protected crux moving from two nice jugs over a bulge on side pulls and crimps. A short but delicate traverse brings you back left 5 feet and straight upward to the second belay. The second pitch is about 100' and goes at 5.10 with the help of a few little hidden crimps.","protection":"set of QDs and a 60m rope.","location":"See Beta Photos.
