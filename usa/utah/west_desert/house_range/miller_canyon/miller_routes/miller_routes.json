When you drill a route on lead, be sure to bring more bolts than you think you'll need. I ran out near the top and thought I could punch it up to a tree. Turns out I was wrong and took a huge fall, hitting an old tree limb that caught the drill on my back and broke the cartilage of a few ribs. Scrambling through the boulders on the way out was one of the more miserable climbing experiences I've had.\n\nFollow the dark brown dacite rib up and right, clipping bolts, mantling and edging your way up. As you turn the corner near the top, you'll find cool edge climbing on the featured dike. Full value climbing.","protection":"bolts (8-10?)","location":"This is in the left fork, on the south facing side of the headwall you see as you first enter the canyon. The dike is a few gullies up and on the right. The canyon is complex but short and you can see it from the ridge opposite if you come in from the far left fork. Should take half an hour from the campsite - unless you don't see it."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,fae759b2-9cfd-54b6-af15-a5602b64b693,2267e2e1-b200-5387-b802-7ad2326e43b7,6583e183-27d7-56c4-a287-9362bfe10e05,976d3249-0497-5ac3-b0fe-cbc76cfb0e4c","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","West Desert","House Range","Miller Canyon","Miller Routes"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.37607,39.16816]},"bbox":[-113.3766499854717,39.16771033981814,-113.37549001452828,39.16860966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114273121","area_id":"l20ySQSXWsOw/svHbPsOTA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:56.380Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:55.255Z"}
