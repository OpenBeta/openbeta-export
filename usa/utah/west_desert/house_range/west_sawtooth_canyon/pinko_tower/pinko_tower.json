Belay at the top of the ramp from a two bolt anchor. 5.10-\n\nP2-Climb the dike, clipping 4 bolts and moving back left into the chimney. Follow the easy chimney to a good stance where the weakness starts arcing diagonally right. Build a belay at the stance. 5.10\n\np3-Follow the weakness which is essentially a huge dike up and right finding good gear placements along the way. At about 35m the dike stops at a big ear-shaped flake. From here, tension traverse out right to a bolt and climb up a few easier moves to a stance and a natural belay or do tenuous moves on the underside of the big ear. The rock is somewhat gritty here.\n\n5.7 AO or 5.11\n\np4-From the belay climb past two bolts into the right-facing hand crack, climb through gritty yet easy terrain from here and scramble to the summit.
