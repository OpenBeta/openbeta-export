A few creatively stacked blocks allow for a move that feels like 5.6, otherwise expect a boulder problem. Once established at the first bolt make your way up following the obvious quartz dike all the way to the top.","protection":"The route has several solution pockets that accept cams from micro size (0 BD C3) to larger cracks (#3 BD C4). A single rack will suffice with a handful of quickdraws. The bolts are oddly spaced with some very long runouts. The climbing is 5.6 but the runouts make it a little more serious.\n\nIt appears that the route originally had a two bolt belay approximately 45 meters up the route. This is now a lone bolt that cannot be backed up. This leaves a few options. Either climb the route with a 70 meter rope which might be long enough to do the entire route (we had a 60m which was not) or step right at the first ledge and belay off the nice Pinyon Pine. The remainder of the route would likely go with a 60m rope. Another option which I wouldn't recommend would be to belay at the bolt above the former belay station and back it up with a shaky #2 camalot in a pocket a couple feet up.\n\nNo fixed anchors are available at the top but there is a great tree to belay off of as you step right. Walk off to the right back down the gully.","location":"Look for the obvious continuous quartz dike on the right side of Candyland Buttress. The route starts as high as you can scramble though an additional half-pitch could be tacked on at the beginning. Several bolts mark the obvious start next to the dike."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,fae759b2-9cfd-54b6-af15-a5602b64b693,2267e2e1-b200-5387-b802-7ad2326e43b7,e7dc32cd-b092-577f-be3f-f98e83f54825,5044f5db-cf12-520d-9dba-1d453c354b0b","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","West Desert","House Range","West Sawtooth Canyon","Candyland Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.43897,39.15457]},"bbox":[-113.43954987344009,39.154120339818135,-113.43839012655991,39.155019660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111288050","area_id":"UET1288SUg2duh1FPDVLCw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-113.43954987344009,39.154120339818135],[-113.43839012655991,39.154120339818135],[-113.43839012655991,39.155019660181864],[-113.43954987344009,39.155019660181864],[-113.43954987344009,39.154120339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:50.589Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:29.091Z"}
