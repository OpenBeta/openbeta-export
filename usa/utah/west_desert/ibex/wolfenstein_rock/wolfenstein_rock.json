A great way to sample some Ibex OW/chimney flavor without fear.\n\nP1)\n\nStarting on the right side of an overhang, climb cool white rock up moderate terrain (5.9/10a) past widely spaced bolts & some fixed gear (nuts & small cams help with the pucker factor). 2 bolt belay. 45-50m pitch.\n\nP2)\n\nEnter the maw, wiggle and squirm up the OW/squeeze chimney. Protect w/nuts and cams until the business starts, commence clipping bolts and somehow moving up. The crux is very well bolted. Bird shit covered jugs inside and outside the chimney signal deliverance for the climber back onto a moderate face. After the chimney, top out and belay off bolts at the very top of the wall. 5.10, another 45m pitch.","protection":"P1, QDs, nuts, single set of cams.\n\nP2, wide stuff helps for the beginning of the OW (a #5 can be placed, or even a 6). Although the first part of this isn't too hard, the rock quality on this part of the pitch is substandard for ibex and holds were coming off as of 4/14. Middle of the pitch has many close bolts, the hard moves of the OW are very well protected!","location":"Wolfenstein buttress, the next big buttress right of the Shadow wall, has a small overhang in the center of the bottom of the face.
