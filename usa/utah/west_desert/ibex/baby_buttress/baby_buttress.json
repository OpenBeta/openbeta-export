Some intermediate pro is possible, but unnecessary for all but the most nervous leaders. All of the anchors are solid and easy to belay from except the top anchor. Though bolted in, it flexes noticeably when weighted. Has good cord on it as of November 2015.","location":"Look for a 3rd class corner directly between Baby Buttress and Quartermoon Tower. This route starts just to the right of it. It is easy to run P1 and P2 together and P3-5 together for a two pitch ascent. Any of the anchors can be rappelled from but with a 60m rope we rapped down to the top of P4, then to the top of P2 and to the ground. The rope barely makes it onto 3rd class terrain."},"__v":0},{"_id":"MvBUrr+EU+uOVTZWzlAdlA==","name":"Baby Carriage","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Kelly and Josie Macleod","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.3897,38.99083]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"119968783","mp_crag_id":"111288310","climb_id":"MvBUrr+EU+uOVTZWzlAdlA==","areaRef":"gpbTkjT4XbyPhNzNECIqdA=="},"content":{"description":"The route starts with a slight overhang and transitions to slab climbing with a mantel to a comfortable ledge to stand on with anchors above","protection":"5 Bolts to anchors shared with Baby Boomer","location":"Right most route on Baby Buttress"},"__v":0},{"_id":"f3WN/x4jVdShCOX2HIhlEQ==","name":"Baby Boomer","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"Kelly and Josie MacLeod","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.3897,38.99083]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"111313102","mp_crag_id":"111288310","climb_id":"f3WN/x4jVdShCOX2HIhlEQ==","areaRef":"gpbTkjT4XbyPhNzNECIqdA=="},"content":{"description":"Short, good route to try if you're in the area.
