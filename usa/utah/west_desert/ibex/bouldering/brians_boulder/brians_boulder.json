To complicate matters, after you hit the half-way point your landing/falling options are non-existent: i.e. don't fall! X-rated equivalant problem.\n\nThe problem starts on a left-facing sidepull that isn't very good. Feet position are critical to utilizing the sidepull. All the other holds are smaller and tougher to use compared to the start. Climb straight up the south face. There are decent top-out holds on this problem.","protection":"Good flat landing for the first half of the problem. After that there is danger of smashing yourself on a sub-boulder located to the left of the problem. We used 4+ pads to help protect this problem. Be aware the problem is fairly high.","location":"This problem is located on the south facing side of the boulder.

Doing so would surely lead to serious injury or worse.\n\nThis problem should be treated like it's 'X' rated.\n\nHaving said that, there is a great flake hold up near the top which looks oh so enticingly inviting - don't use it, as it's suspect and if it broke would land you onto the sub-boulder.","location":"This problem is located just to the left of the SE corner of the boulder on the South face. If you are standing in front of the problem there will be a sub-boulder just to your right which isn't connected to the main Brian boulder.\n\nThe starting jug is fairly obvious, as well as the undercling on the crack system that starts up into the broken dihedral.\n\nAll problems on this boulder utilize the down climb on the NE corner.

It doesn't get any better than this.
