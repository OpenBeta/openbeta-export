I recently did it and saw no chalk even deep in the crack or any sign of travel....too bad really because it is pretty good. The crux is high on this route and it may be worth it to just do the half of the first pitch as this is really a great 5.9+ or 5.10a pitch. Mega interesting moves in moderate terrain.\n\nOriginally, and as noted in the guidebook, one may pass this first set of anchors and climb a long first 5.10 pitch, but a set of rap anchors encountered on a ledge after an overhang is good in its own right as something to do.","protection":"The rap station for Pitch #1 has been beefed up with 2x3/8\"x 4\" Bolts and chain.
