We hiked up to this tower on a foggy day after snow and weather spoiled much of our climbing plans. The day before we had seen it while hiking and had hoped that the tower was taller and a true separate summit.\n\nInstead, you can stem between the tower and the wall all the way up until the very top. And, it proved to be only about 25 feet from the saddle to the top. Regardless, it was a reasonably enjoyable outing considering our options were pretty limited that day. Some small gear protects this thing thoroughly.\n\nBeware that the summit block is detached from the tower and has a lot of space between it and the rest of the tower. Down climb the route or engineer an anchor as there are no fixed anchors on top.\n\nI put a \"?\" for the FA because it's totally feasible that somebody else had done what we had done. It is out of the way, not obvious, not destination worthy and we did clean some junk rock out of the obvious crack so it's possible we were the first to lay hands on it. But, it may even be possible jump it from the rim for the reasonably hardy.","protection":"Nuts, including small with cams up to #1 Camalot.
