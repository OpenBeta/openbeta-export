Despite its dwarfish stature, fun is guaranteed on this climb and views across the hardpan are unequalled.\n\nLisa and Shen liked the party atmosphere so much on top, they needed a bit of coercion to rap down before nightfall!\n\nPitch #1: Approach the north side of the plug which is almost the most southerly chunk of rock at Ibex. Climb up the fun holds either following a discontinuous crack on the right or the face moves on the left. Two-bolt belay on top with chain anchors. Good value! 5.7, 18m.\n\nExperienced Ibex climber Kris Pietryga joined Lisa and Shen on top for the second ascent and finds the route to be of exceptional value!\n\nRappel the \"tower\".","protection":"QDs for a few bolts and a small selection of Camalots to #2.","location":"The only known established route on S&L Tower, it is not inconceivable that this tower could have previously been bouldered.\n\nFind the obvious Plug and fire it!\n\nThree bolts on top of this table top tower."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,fae759b2-9cfd-54b6-af15-a5602b64b693,f1b4726f-5b34-52be-b7fb-f6e0df89436d,cc9d2a14-6933-5612-9a13-a92d4662be13","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","West Desert","Ibex","S&L Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.3883,38.9926]},"bbox":[-113.38887854403696,38.99215033981814,-113.38772145596303,38.99304966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107641753","area_id":"zJ0qFGkzVhKaE6ktRmK+Ew=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:56.378Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:55.173Z"}
