You do gain a huge ledge under a giant white roof. This is where you would think a 2nd belay station would be. There is not. You could build one if you have brought trad gear(there is no other reason to bring trad gear). You should just continue climbing out the right side of the cave. You can quickly clip 2 bolts on the overhanging corner of the cave. The rope drag is just fine. The nose you have to pull over to get out of the cave is simply, fantastically, desperate. Fight up some easing terrain as you gain the summit. Rap twice.","protection":"The current guide is all wrong about this route. It is 2 pitches(not 3) and all you need is qucikdraws(no gear needed).

On the left side of the gully at the top of the cliff you will see 2 giant white overhangs, one right on top of the other. The greatest route at the ibex climbs starts in the shaded gully and climbs to the upper of the 2 white overhangs. The route starts on a huge ledge way up in the gully. You have to do a bit of bushwhacking to get there. As you get further up the gully I found it easiest to start walking up the slab to the right and then zig-zagg back left. Me and my dog made it up this gully together. If you have a big dog or a clumsy dog you should leave them lower on the hillside. There is actually a set of anchors at the top of the gulley so that you can rap back down.(Not sure why?). We didn't use them but maybe if there was snow on the ground or something you would rap instead of walking down the gully."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,fae759b2-9cfd-54b6-af15-a5602b64b693,f1b4726f-5b34-52be-b7fb-f6e0df89436d,f6bc65a6-048b-5fa5-8673-2ed512e017fb","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","West Desert","Ibex","Shamrock Scare Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":4,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.3883,38.9926]},"bbox":[-113.38887854403696,38.99215033981814,-113.38772145596303,38.99304966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105972273","area_id":"9rxlpgSLX6WGcy7VEuAX+w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:56.378Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:23:55.127Z"}
