The rock quality starts out as absolutely abysmal but improves the higher you go. The first pitch offers an overhanging hand crack for a crux then a traverse right. Keep an eye out for the chains, they're not intuitive. Continue traversing right and then finish straight up to the chains on the left.\n\nThe route is rated as 5.8 in James Garrett's guidebook but a rating of 5.9 PG13 might be more appropriate for those considering the climb. A very crumbly start and some creative anchor placements on top of pitch 1 mean the possibility of a factor two fall on your belayer is real.","protection":"Bring a full double set of cams. Triples in hand sizes wouldn't be a bad idea.","location":"From the parking area the route is visible. Head northwest towards the crack but when you reach the cliff, skirt towards the north and climb up broken layers to reach the true start of the route. Coming up directly from the south in the chimney/gully will mean a difficult to protect 5.7 start until you reach the two bolt anchor at the base of the route.\n\nThe route can be rapped with a single 70m. A 60m should work as well. There is a two chain anchor at the very top of the route and a single chain anchor and bolt at the top of the first pitch. A couple more leaver biners would make for a convenient third rappel instead of the loose downclimb to the northwest."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ee1d37e7-dc41-5c26-a358-5d51af01f499,fae759b2-9cfd-54b6-af15-a5602b64b693,f1b4726f-5b34-52be-b7fb-f6e0df89436d,3ee3fe76-32d5-5abc-9931-368d12f1499d","pathTokens":["USA","Utah","West Desert","Ibex","Blind Valley"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.47166,38.88814]},"bbox":[-113.47223769233238,38.887690339818135,-113.4710823076676,38.888589660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109800995","area_id":"PuP+djLVWryZMTaNEvFJnQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-113.47223769233238,38.887690339818135],[-113.4710823076676,38.887690339818135],[-113.4710823076676,38.888589660181864],[-113.47223769233238,38.888589660181864],[-113.47223769233238,38.887690339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:26:56.778Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:07:36.905Z"}
