A 70m rope is just long enough to be lowered off comfortably. If you only have a 60m rope you could probably do two raps using the anchor at the top of the short sport route to climber's right but the anchor looks very sketchy (rusty homemade hangers)","location":"Look for the bolted line that follows a right leaning flared chimney roughly in the middle of the east face of the largest continuous section of the redneck rocks closest to the road.
