Start with one hand on each lower corner of the obvious jutting prow, with your feet starting down low. Then compress, heel hook and slap your way up into one very reachy move to a jug on the right face of the block, then do a few more cool compression and hook moves on good holds to a top jug. Once you hit the center face jug, find a way to make the top out; there are a few great, but hard to see jugs above the right face of the climb that make pulling up on the right face easy, although still a little scary. Figuring out where those jugs are from above will help a lot. Top out, straddle the block, and carefully make your way back down.\n\nLong arms and a long sleeve shirt to prevent scrapes will both be helpful on this route, grade is variable with wingspan. A sit start is also possible to add a grade or two.","protection":"A few pads+ a good spot to keep you safe through the upper section, landing is not great.","location":"Follow the rocky ridge trail from the south past a few small boulder fields until you see the obvious prow right by the left side of the trail, a few hundred feet past the first main field."},"__v":0},{"_id":"by7OFuoUX/23bo3SSpYRLg==","name":"Icebox","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.36511,39.06894]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119246091","mp_crag_id":"119181210","climb_id":"by7OFuoUX/23bo3SSpYRLg==","areaRef":"EoobH9QeUTitufiavf178A=="},"content":{"description":"Fun tension-y problem set in a refrigerator alcove, almost always a few degrees cooler than everywhere else.
