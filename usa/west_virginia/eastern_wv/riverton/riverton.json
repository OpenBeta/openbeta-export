Felt like “Ecstasy” for a move.\n\nP1 chimney to a Dirty lichen covered belay ledge. (Note: I tried to clear as much lichen as I could but it was getting dark and had to hurry.)  Build trad anchor.\n\nP2 Step up and out to arete. Some airy moves take you to up then over left to a bushy ledge. Getting past the bush is another crux: that thing is trying to push you off. Go under the sideways tree then up to the top. Wild exposure on the top, small spire with amazing views. Belay from 5 foot horn just below.\n\nCan be climbed in one long pitch with careful management and some run outs.\n\nDescent: no walk off option. Rappel off horn. I left a 6mm cord up there on 12/30/21. A 60M rope gets you to the ground as long as you rap from the middle of the rope.","protection":"Standard Trad rack.","location":"Route starts at the chimney.
