Couple good food holds at the bottom. Right hand to the round knob a couple feet above slit, and left hand to the crack a couple feet directly across the main slit. Pull your left hand up to the vertical crack 3 feet directly above the first crack, as you move your left foot up to a small angled edge a couple of feet up. Right foot to main slit, and right hand to a little 2 finger crimp. This is probably the trickiest part, but once you get your balance and your left foot smeared on a small angled park of the face, you can reach the top. Top out and go down the side or back.","protection":"A pad. A tarp is nice because that ground tends to stay pretty damp.","location":"At the boulder in the middle of the park past the 20mph sign if you are heading to the soccer fields from the lake.
