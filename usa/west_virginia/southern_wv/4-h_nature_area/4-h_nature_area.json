This has been used by the camp for years and is bolted at the top with stainless hangers with either 3/8 or 10mm bolts. If you top rope, you might reach one hanger from the top but the other one is out of reach without rapping down a couple feet. The path back to the overlook is pretty obvious from the bottom and will require some scrambling. There are snakes in the area and this rock has lots of nice places for snakes, so check carefully before putting your hand somewhere you can't see. Don't use the sketchy wire rope wrapped around the rock on top.","protection":"Top anchors.","location":"Look for the rock outcrop on Google Maps. Follow the nature trail up the hill.
