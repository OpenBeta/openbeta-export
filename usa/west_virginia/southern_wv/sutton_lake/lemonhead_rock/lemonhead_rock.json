Move to the right and place a cam in the 2\" crack below Lemon's lip then climb over the lip or place a stopper and sling as an aider to pass over the lip, the crux of the climb. There is a nice 1\" crack to the right after you crest the lip. Use it to place pro or another aider to get your feet on the rock. Once standing on the lip there is a bolt to the left or a few nice cracks to place bomber pro.
