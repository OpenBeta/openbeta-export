There is no way to weasel your way around this crux.  Bring finger strength and a boulderer's mentality if you hope to have any success on this 3-4 move boulder problem.  The obvious sequence sets you up for brutal shoulder wrenching, iron cross beta, but alternative beta spares you of the shouldery move.  The boulder problem is hard V5 if not V6.\n\nAt the sixth bolt, transitioning from the steep angle to a blunt arete is a bit sequential.  Once established on the arete the climbing eases to 5.11 with numerous resting spots.\n\nLong slings on the third and fourth bolt make the excursion more enjoyable (from a rope drag stand point).
