Burly is the best way to sum it up.   Although it is a sport route, its a nice blend of trad and sport skills.   Start by climbing up into a pod/offwidth and dogleg left into the overhang.  Throw in kneebar after kneebar as you inch out left toward the 4th bolt.  Turn the lip and head into the dihedral.   Face climb and stem your way through the dihedral to reach the roof.  From here work your way left to pull the overhang for the best rest on the climb.   From here, it's still not over, continue up through a crack system and a dyno to reach the shuts.  Be careful through bolt 4.   A tight belay is necessary to keep you from hitting the ground.   It is recommended to have the belayer tie in for the lower section and then unclip once the climber reaches the dihedral.
