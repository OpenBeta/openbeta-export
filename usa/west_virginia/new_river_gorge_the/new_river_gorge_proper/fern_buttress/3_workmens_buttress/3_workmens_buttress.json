Move across the arête to the left side, take in the view and exposure and follow generous but spaced horizontals to bolted anchors at the top.\n\nThe direct start to this route is R rated unless you have some very large gear (Big Bro) to plug in the ~20' detached block to start. This R start can be circumvented by walking uphill to climber's right ten feet, climbing the short dihedral to the top of the block, then traversing left. There is no gear, so technically it's still PG13, but much easier climbing than the direct start.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"yk7qilsdUwuKu8bmiliAzA==","name":"Toss that Beat in the Garbage Can","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Mike Artz, Eddie Begoon","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.06911,38.06369]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"107129386","mp_crag_id":"107129354","climb_id":"yk7qilsdUwuKu8bmiliAzA==","areaRef":"kV7Zy6iOUTmLPal9X8OQiQ=="},"content":{"description":"This rounded arete is \"a bit of a sandbag\" according to Mike Williams.
