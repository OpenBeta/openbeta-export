Have good spotters for this problem; if you fall too far to the right you'll roll down into the creek; too far left, you'll fall into the pit.\n\nThe crux is a big throw out left over the area where the boulder drops away.  If you miss this throw, you'll almost certainly land on the boulder, and not fall off of it, but it is still kind of a scary move.  Stick the throw, make one more tenuous move to get established on the lip, and mantle on up over to the slab.","protection":"Pads.  Some folks swear that it is possible to protect this safely with only one pad and a couple attentive spotters, but use your own judgement.","location":"The only established problem on the Water Equation boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,77388747-52f3-59bf-a6e7-e9a28094aba4,8a004a82-852f-54ab-ad77-bcbed7774cb5,859a8442-3fbd-542b-98fd-0eb6b3d2d762,f6cc6e0c-8531-5c88-b48b-51e5eb937d49,73b6c221-e2b7-5df0-8b59-3993828a3491,3f134e5d-738f-5b2a-9d6f-58f893c385fd,f248c6d6-83b0-57e1-9b19-fff32dd589d5","pathTokens":["USA","West Virginia","New River Gorge, The","New River Gorge Proper","Beauty Mountain","Short Creek Bouldering","Short Creek Right","Water Equation Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.03566,38.05496]},"bbox":[-81.03623105519273,38.05451033981814,-81.03508894480727,38.05540966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114210887","area_id":"8kjG1oOwV+GbGf/zLdWJ1Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-81.03623105519273,38.05451033981814],[-81.03508894480727,38.05451033981814],[-81.03508894480727,38.05540966018187],[-81.03623105519273,38.05540966018187],[-81.03623105519273,38.05451033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:33:08.324Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:38.194Z"}
