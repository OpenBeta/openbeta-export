The story goes that Dan worked the crux on a short leash, never really dialing in the sequence perfectly. The next day, with friends and cameras in tow, he set out to solo the climb. Maybe the sun drenched wall, maybe his nerves, or perhaps the reality and severity of such a serious solo got the best of him, and he began to verbally doubt himself, telling his buddies that he wasn't sure he wanted to go through with it while hanging out at the sun-drenched stance just below the crux.
