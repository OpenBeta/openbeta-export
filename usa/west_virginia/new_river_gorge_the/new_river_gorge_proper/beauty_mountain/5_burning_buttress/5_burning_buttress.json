Dead vertical with relentless edging, this route features a nasty crux, with the opportunity to take some legitimate whippers. It's hard to imagine that sport climbing originated from routes like this, and easy to understand why routes of this style have lost their popularity. Legend has it that \"Old Master,\" Porter Jarrard, emerged briefly from the backwoods of West Virginia, for a repeat of the route in 2010. Hanging the draws on his first attempt, many years after his initial ascent, he was able to manage a redpoint. Don't expect any magic like this for yourself. This route, especially the crux, is likely to mow you down your first time up it.\n\nThe first three bolts of edging and high stepping on tiny crimps lead to a rest at the fourth bolt. Lay back some decent holds and step sequentially past the fourth bolt and then bear down on a couple more tiny crimps before reaching a resting position at the fifth bolt. The V7 technical crux awaits you. Do a frontal highstep onto a small edge at belly button height, grab a vertical potato chip sized side pull well above your head, and try to stand up as high as possible before your finger tips are severed off. Recklessly grab a right hand edge and get ready for more hideous crimps.\n\nOne more redpoint crux awaits you a bolt below the anchors. Don't blow it here because you'll never want to have to pull the technical crux again.\n\nThis route gets morning shade and also retains shade through the afternoon if leaves are on the tree. Give it a try.
