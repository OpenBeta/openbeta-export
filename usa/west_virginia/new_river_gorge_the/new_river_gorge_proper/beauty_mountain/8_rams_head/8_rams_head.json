Start on the right of two 30 foot handcracks, up to a ledge, then pull a really cool roof on jams and jugs to get established in the wavering finger crack above.  There are a couple different ways to go with different crack systems (most take the right), but both lead to the base of a mini-dihedral.  Continue up the steep crack, via good stances, to an ancient pair of rusted bolts (no need to clip these, the gear is awesome and they're super terrible).  Above the bolts you'll move through a couple pods, then finish on glory jugs to one of the best topouts at the NRG.\n\nNo fixed anchors; although if there were you could just BARELY lower off this with a full 70m rope.  Best to belay your follower off trees at the top, then make an easy rap off the lower ground to the left.","protection":"A couple pieces of everything.
