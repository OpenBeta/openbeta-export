In fact it would probably be in the best interest of anyone and everyone to try this route as long as they don't mind hucking meat.  The Gipper is by far the most fun out of a distinguished group of short bouldery routes at the NRG.\n\nOverhanging approximately 35 degrees, and featured with just the right amount of smooth pockets, slopers and underclings, every move is interesting and somewhat difficult.  There are two distinctly hard sections on the route.  The first involves a core intensive move off of an undercling.  The second (crux) is the type of move that boulderers dream of.  This final crux can be done as an all points off dyno or a counterintuitive windmill dyno.  Either way you slice it you're looking at a single V7 move with a bit of pump.\n\nOne question remains after sampling the exquisite routes on this mysterious block.
