It was bolted by Brian McCray and Tom Cecil in the late 80's. This giant intimidating cave route fell into obscurity after the early 90's. The 2 people known to have tried it before Mike Farnsworth were Stephan Glowacz and Jordi Salas. Stephan apparently backed off due to a loose block(i couldn't find it) and Jordi worked on it for a season. Start in the back of the cave and climb \"nightmare 13a\" for 7 bolts to an almost no hands rest. Then continue out the roof past 4 more bolts through a difficult crux turning the lip ~ v9.
