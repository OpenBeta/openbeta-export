It is technically a variation to Old Ladies Excitement.  It has serious run outs and is infrequently done, so expect to be brushing off lichen to find your holds (some of which may break...).\n\nThe original submission for this route generally followed what was previously thought of as Amazing Grace but research for Ed 4 revealed some changes that needed to be made.  I've attempted to preserve as much of the original submitter's info as possible while still keeping true to the route. (AW - Admin)\n\nProtection is infrequent but (mostly) solid, but falls shouldn't be dangerous until you get to the last 30 ft of the route (follower would hit the Soler Flake full force in a fall... bolt could probably protect that).\n\nStart: At the intersecting ledge with bolts atop Dirty Old Man, Frosted Flake (P1) and Old Ladies Excitement (P1).  The easiest access is to climb P1 of Old Ladies Excitement.\n\nP1.  Climb P2 of Old Ladies Excitement until about 15 ft from the top and make a belay.\n\nP2. Traverse right around the corner onto the lichen-covered face. Pass the shuts on T. R. Rap and Tap to a thin vertical crack. Follow this straight up to a set of shuts (end here to skip the dangerous traverse). Continue right and very slightly up to head directly for the top of Soler Flake.
