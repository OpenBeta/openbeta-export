It’s unlike anything else at Seneca. Climb a series of narrow right facing corner systems up and left until you can pull a bulge about half way going straight up out of the alley to an under cling. Then traverse left to the obvious right facing corner, up to a tree you can belay from on North Peak. The protection is adequate and probably should only be rated PG-13 but just to be safe, it is R in the guidebook and a fall may result in ping ponging back and forth between the two walls. If you’re confident in the grade climb it!","protection":"Standard Seneca rack, gear to 3 inches, micro cams and micro stoppers are useful before the bulge. Tree anchor at the top.","location":"Located about 20 feet inside No Dally Alley approaching from the south side. I believe the best way to get to it is to climb up Pine Tree Traverse to the alley. The climb follows a series of narrow right facing corners up the wall on the east side of the alley (the wall climbers right, if entering the alley from the south side)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,77388747-52f3-59bf-a6e7-e9a28094aba4,3cb64de3-1c23-5350-abdb-baefd7fbf103,dbfa5b70-a291-508e-8b83-44697c152d4f","pathTokens":["USA","West Virginia","Seneca Rocks","North Peak - West Face"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":3,"label":"5.1"},{"count":3,"label":"5.4"},{"count":3,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":3,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.3"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":26,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":8,"intermediate":7,"advanced":11,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":8,"intermediate":7,"advanced":12,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.36614,38.8353]},"bbox":[-79.36671726319098,38.83485033981813,-79.36556273680904,38.83574966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105910040","area_id":"2/pbcKKRUI6Lg0RpfBUtTw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-79.36671726319098,38.83485033981813],[-79.36556273680904,38.83485033981813],[-79.36556273680904,38.83574966018186],[-79.36671726319098,38.83574966018186],[-79.36671726319098,38.83485033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":27,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:33:08.725Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:08:49.903Z"}
