Not many places to place pro I wouldn't recommend it as a trad route and it wanders a bit more than I would like if someone were to bolt it.","protection":"So far I would recommend only top rope.\n\nYou can anchor off a decent sized tree at the top of the route and if you need to place extra gear at the top. There are no fixed bolts for this route.","location":"If you follow the standard trail this is the first area you come to when you reach the crag. If you look up you can see the tree used to anchor. To get to the top go around to the right and there is a small 10 ft ledge you can climb up on shimmy through the gap between the rocks and walk right to the anchor point. Rappelling down is possible avoid rappelling off to the right if looking from the top there is a pretty nasty ledge that you cant see just after the drop over the edge."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,77388747-52f3-59bf-a6e7-e9a28094aba4,b520fb53-77fd-5313-85af-51231136df43,24584a92-aa80-5b7e-94fb-111113cde241,31cc83a6-e031-507f-9247-b77d8d1bbc2b","pathTokens":["USA","West Virginia","Northern WV","North Bend State Park","Castle Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.10091,39.21904]},"bbox":[-81.10149040558503,39.218590339818135,-81.10032959441496,39.219489660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110216279","area_id":"McyDpuAxUH+SR7d9jRu8Kw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-81.10149040558503,39.218590339818135],[-81.10032959441496,39.218590339818135],[-81.10032959441496,39.219489660181864],[-81.10149040558503,39.219489660181864],[-81.10149040558503,39.218590339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:33:10.595Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:41.953Z"}
