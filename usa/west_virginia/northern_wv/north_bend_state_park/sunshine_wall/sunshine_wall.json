Â Holds are great at the bottom but get a little thinner near the top, which is the crux. Try to stay in between the drill lines for a little more challenge. 1st bolt is about 12 feet up so beginning leaders may want to use a stick clip. Rock is extremely grippy, so smearing is abundant. If you want to top rope, it is safer to rappel from the two anchors at the base of the headwall directly above this climb because of the steep bank at the top of this climb. This is also a great spot to learn to rappel. Enjoy!","protection":"3 bolts and ring top anchors.
