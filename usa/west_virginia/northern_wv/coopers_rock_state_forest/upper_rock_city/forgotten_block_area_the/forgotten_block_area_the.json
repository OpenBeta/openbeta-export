Find your choice of feet and make a move to a good hold on the lip. From here. Navigate right along the lip through two pockets, a deep sidepull, and upper edge.\n\nFrom here there could be a few different ways to get to the finish. I found the most sensible way is to pop to a right hand hold on the right side of the prow, hold the pendulum and bring the left hand over to compress.
