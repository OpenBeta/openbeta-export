Use the crack to pull onto the overhanging section and use a good right foothold to move up and pull onto the slab to the right. At this point you are on a 15 foot friction slab over a bad landing. Keep calm and smear to the lip of the boulder to topout. Those with zero head game can chicken out and transition left to the mellow slab to retreat.
