Start on high incut edges and follow somewhat sharp edges, a pinch, and a sharp pocket to reach the lip of the boulder and top out.

The crux is probably finding the actual holds.","protection":"Pads","location":"Located on the river facing side of the Electric Avenue block on the sharp, unpleasant looking pocketed face."},"__v":0},{"_id":"/PM1gVy8WhWh2fnIDGntgA==","name":"Neon Light","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.80363,39.63328]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107505035","mp_crag_id":"107505022","climb_id":"/PM1gVy8WhWh2fnIDGntgA==","areaRef":"bCYcyMmQW6aQDIHcB/nNcw=="},"content":{"description":"A decent problem with a frightening topout. Stand start on the arete on some good holds with a tree conveniently placed directly behind you. Make a long move to a good pocket and cruise up on some massive sculpted jugs. Make use of a good undercling and pocket on the arete and commit to the sloping, often dirty topout. Degrading beached-whale moves may be involved. Try not to fall, it won't be pretty considering the tree in the landing zone. I thought the entire V2 grade was in the topout.
