Crack starts narrow then flares to 4\" at top. Crux is at the middle and top. Bring doubles of #1. The whole crack is slightly overhung the whole way. A number 4 will protect the crux well, but place it right or you'll deck if it blows. This climb is also known to some as \"Deep Woods Crack\".","protection":"There is a red maple tree to belay from at the top. There are also some loose flakes of rock on top. Be careful where you step. Rappel from red maple tree.","location":"Continue past Sunset wall on broken trail until you see a tilted block down hill on your right.
