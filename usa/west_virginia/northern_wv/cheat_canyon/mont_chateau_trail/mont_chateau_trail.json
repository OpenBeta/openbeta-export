The hemlock at the top is a perfect anchor.","location":"Approaching from Mont Chateau: Hike the trail behind the building to Quarry Run.  After Crossing Quarry Run, head left, uphill.  When you see the large “coral” boulder on the right side of the trail, and a beautiful waterfall on your left, walk straight uphill and you will arrive at the short cliff band."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,77388747-52f3-59bf-a6e7-e9a28094aba4,b520fb53-77fd-5313-85af-51231136df43,f037c853-6adb-5357-910a-be3b2a9ccc9f,a8ffeae5-0db3-5c62-988c-8aa74ff2787b","pathTokens":["USA","West Virginia","Northern WV","Cheat Canyon","Mont Chateau Trail"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.84516,39.65713]},"bbox":[-79.8457440673487,39.656680339818145,-79.84457593265131,39.65757966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117568570","area_id":"qP/q5Q2zXGKYjIqnT/J4ew==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-79.8457440673487,39.656680339818145],[-79.84457593265131,39.656680339818145],[-79.84457593265131,39.65757966018187],[-79.8457440673487,39.65757966018187],[-79.8457440673487,39.656680339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:33:08.730Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:39.377Z"}
