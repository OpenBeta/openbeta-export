This was a ground-up foray to gain the midway ledge and the harder and dirtier approach pitch. There are bits of good climbing buried under the dirt, I promise. With significant cleaning (which we didn't do, sorry) or even a bolted variation to the left, this could be good. The rock and pro is good, at least.\n\nStart 15 feet to the right of the Drawbridge in a shallow left facing corner. Climb this, stepping onto a slab below two hand crack bulges when the corner ends. These provide the crux. An easier hand crack takes you to another ledge, where you can either climb straight up with minimal pro, or, veer hard left along a ramp before pulling jugs onto the midway ledge.

Trad gear is needed only as a directional for the follower after pulling the lip, where a .75 and/or 1 C4 (green/red Totems would be even better) can be placed in a horizontal before shuffling left to the bolted anchor. Don't forgo the gear, your follower and rope will hate you.\n\nFrom the bolted anchor, it's a 35m free-hanging rap to the ground.
