You can get sucked into the top portion of Perplexus if you veer left near the middle of the route, but keep your eyes open for bolts to the right.\n\nAs of May 2016 there is still a semi loose block near the 6th bolt.  It's a little bigger than a softball and very tempting to use as a clipping hold.  I tried to pry it out when I put up the route years ago but I couldn't get it to go.  It's marked with an X right now and there are plenty of good holds near it, and the climbing in that area is pretty mellow.  If someone has the motivation maybe they can try to get it out of there.  Someone left some prying tools at the base of the cliff.
