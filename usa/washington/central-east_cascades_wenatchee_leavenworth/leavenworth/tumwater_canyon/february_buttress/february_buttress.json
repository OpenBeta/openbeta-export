The rock deteriorates (crumbly, mossy) quickly, but stays at the grade.  Beware that there are no more bolted anchors above.  (When I did it, we rapped off of a sling around a scary tottering choss pile.)  I don't know for sure, but it looks likely that you can top out and walk off to the right.

Trad gear is required around the steeper step. (100ft).\n\nP2: Climb up and left up a slab (5.4) past 5-bolts. A steeper slab move right below the anchors (5.7) on a large ledge.
