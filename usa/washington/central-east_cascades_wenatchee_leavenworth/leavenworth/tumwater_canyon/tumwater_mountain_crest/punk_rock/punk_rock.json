What appears as burly overhanging OW from below actually climbs a bit more delicately. Don't get tunnel vision when the crack pinches down - a big jug rail will see you through. Great finish.\n\nThere's a jutting chockstone at the top of the initial corner. I did everything I could to try and get this thing to budge. It's probably okay to stand on, but I'd be wary of yarding on it. Luckily, it can be climbed around easily and safely.\n\nThe initial corner can be a little dirty and awkward, but is cleaning up well. An alternate start can climb the 5.8 hands to the right, stepping left into Sleep Now in the Fire at the aforementioned chockstone.","protection":"Standard rack with emphasis on hand and fist size gear.

The book said 4\" crack, while I did use a #4, I was glad to have a #5- was the only thing that fit the upper 10' before a left side horn. The book calls this OW finish 5.8, figures all chimneys and OW are 5.8,and in 1979 it would have been hard to protect this. I think that if your knee fits in a #5 crack you will feel chill on this, for me it was hand stack, slide, slither fest.
