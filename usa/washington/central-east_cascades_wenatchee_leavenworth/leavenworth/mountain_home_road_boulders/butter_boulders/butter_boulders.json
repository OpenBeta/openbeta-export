A good friend had mentioned he wanted to adopt a kitten and someone suggested he go to downtown Leavenworth to the Gingerbread factory and adopt one for free. Anyone who has been downtown late at night or god-forbid grew up here, knows the gingerbread factory is the center of the universe for garbage-fattened raccoons, rats and generations of feral cats. His description of the cats to be found there inspired the name of the boulder. Thanks Max.","protection":"2 pads, spotter.","location":"From the parking area, head straight up the hill (W) instead of into the thinned forest towards the main cluster. From the top of the hill (moraine), look for a a flat stump on the crest and below it a bigish boulder. It is pretty much a straight line from the car and only about 5 minutes but will require some searching as the actual route faces downhill."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,04e395a7-b62f-5055-b5c3-e0a7b724df28,b96949b3-800c-5af2-9f02-3e5fa37439eb,67c7f4d5-bac9-5dda-b050-b48b3fac3e4d","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Leavenworth","Mountain Home Road boulders","Butter Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3-4"},{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.65719,47.55164]},"bbox":[-120.65785623683026,47.55119033981814,-120.65652376316977,47.55208966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120022824","area_id":"Z8f01brJXdqwULSLP6w+TQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:58.609Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:56.505Z"}
