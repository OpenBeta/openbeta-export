The first pitch is 35 meters of some of the best slab climbing I've ever done in the Icicle.  The position is astounding with the immense North Wall of Mt. Stuart as your backdrop and Icicle road 2,000' below you.\n\nIt shows that Great care went into creating this pitch.  Small to medium gear supplements the bolts.  The moves are always a puzzle to unlock, and cruxes come at you in multiple waves, right up to the last few moves to the anchor.\n\nPitch two features mostly gear, with cruxy moves over two overlaps, with the second leading you to an exposed headwall crack to the top of the Buttress.  The second pitch is a bit gritty.\n\nI must say Swingline is one of my favorite routes up there.  Thanks to Brad Metz for establishing this one!\n\nA single 70m rope will get you back down easily. A 60m will leave you with some downclimbing on the second rap.","protection":"Bolts and gear to 3\".","location":"Upper Eight Mile Buttress."},"__v":0},{"_id":"hoaGH5I4V42hlywlSFZMHQ==","name":"Lucky Charms","yds":"5.8+","grades":{"yds":"5.8+","french":"5b"},"fa":"Ron Cotman & Gordon Briody; 2004","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.7106,47.5427]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119050499","mp_crag_id":"110576869","climb_id":"hoaGH5I4V42hlywlSFZMHQ==","areaRef":"MkLk3FmKXTupnDOBAxM7xw=="},"content":{"description":"Ascends quartz filled rock to chains just left of the Crystal Cave. Entirely quartz sections are really interesting and unique, but the rock is very delicate and sketchy. I thought this route, like many Ron Cotman routes, was quite bagged- more like Leavenworth 5.9, and harder elsewhere in WA.\n\nThe route has consistent 15-20' runouts, and the consequences of a fall on any of them would be severe. There are at least 2 sections where you might as well be free soloing. I don't give 'R' ratings lightly.\n\n5th bolt is kinda hidden, it's there, up and left. When you get to the white roof with black lip (see pic), STAY LOW below it. The (6th) bolt is at the far left end of the roof and is hard to see. This is one of the very dangerous runouts with both pendulum (on sharp rock) and ledge fall potential. The other is the 2nd bolt on frictionless quartz with a certain groundfall if you fell.","protection":"9 bolts and nice bolted chain anchors.","location":"There are only two lines gaining Crystal Cave- one on the far left of the wall (\"Lucky Charms\", 5.8++R) and the other just below the right side of the cave, which is a mixed route (\"Crystal Cave Route\", 5.7)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"C473G1L5UseZOzOxcCEqqQ==","name":"Cockfight","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Ron Cotman,  Tony Bentley 2002","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.7106,47.5427]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"110576894","mp_crag_id":"110576869","climb_id":"C473G1L5UseZOzOxcCEqqQ==","areaRef":"MkLk3FmKXTupnDOBAxM7xw=="},"content":{"description":"The first 2 pitches are quite good, I did them as one 160' pitch.
