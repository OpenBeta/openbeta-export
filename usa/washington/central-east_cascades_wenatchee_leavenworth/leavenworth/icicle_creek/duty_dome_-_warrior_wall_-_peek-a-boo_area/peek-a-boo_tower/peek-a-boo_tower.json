Like many routes in Icicle Creek, it is a mix of bolt and gear protected slab climbing. Described as 4 pitches, easily climbed in 3.  All anchors are bolted.\n\nP1.  Begin left of a small gully.  A short rib gives way to easy low angle slabs.  Follow a wide crack through a steep wall, then more slabs.  Gear and a few bolts.  5.7\n\nP2.  A comitting and balancy move off the belay onto a friction face, then smear up past horizontal cracks to easier slabs above.  5.9\n\nP3.  A short pitch heads up a steeper slab.  Smearing and nice edging, then a fun pull through a small roof.  Easily combined with P2 using a 60m rope.  5.9\n\nP4.  Move the belay to the anchor at the base of Lawn Darts.  Climb the pocketed groove/chimney/crack thing, which is much weirder to describe than to climb.  A fun and memorable pitch.  5.8","protection":"A light rack to 3\", including some small sized TCUs and 2 large cams for the final pitch (#3 and #4 camalot).  Be comfortable on 5.8 for the final pitch, and look around a bit for the gear.  There are 2 or 3 bolts  on the final pitch, nicely placed for wide/hard to protect moves.","location":"To descend:  Rap the route (120' rappels)"},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.748Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.748Z"},{"_id":"WYzNDrktVqWsB1DeYJRY0g==","name":"West Face","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.74655,47.54891]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"108151526","mp_crag_id":"105940717","areaRef":"ToiAyXX6WQCqsM4Y3QtF1g=="},"content":{"description":"From the top of the 2nd pitch of Yard Art, the West Face route follows a bolt line that heads left towards and then around the arete of the tower. The Kramar guidebook describes a second anchor near the base of this pitch, but the hangers were gone when we climbed it.  The pitch can be easily climbed from the Yard Art belay.\n\nOnce around the arete and onto the west face, follow a 4-inch fist crack for 15 feet and then climb steeply up a bolted face and arete onto the summit ridge of the tower.\n\nThis pitch has a little bit of slab climbing, a clean fist crack and some very airy face climbing at the top.  You top out on a little summit with great views of the Icicle Creek valley - very fun.  We rapped back down to one of the Yard Art belays with a 70 m.","protection":"Quickdraws, slings, and a single set of cams to #4.  I used a 3, 3.5 and 4 on the fist crack, and there are one or two smaller placements before that.","location":""},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.748Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.748Z"},{"_id":"49Mgfk9DVqCTi7RL/Z8Uyw==","name":"Scarecrow","yds":"5.10a","grades":{"yds":"5.10a","french":"6a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.74655,47.54891]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"107147123","mp_crag_id":"105940717","areaRef":"ToiAyXX6WQCqsM4Y3QtF1g=="},"content":{"description":"This route climbs the steep face of the tower opposite the west face route.

From the belay, move up the slab on good friction and solid edges.  Holds get a little thinner/more balancy as the angle increases.  The crux is pulling a bulge 2/3 of the way up the route with good feet and thin holds.  This is an incredible line with fantastic movement!","protection":"Although this route is bolt protected with solid gear and good spacing (12-14 bolts with anchor), you will need to climb the first few pitches of Yard Art (mixed, 5.9, gear to 3inches) in order to reach the belay.  Pay attention to rappels as some of the routes are long (120' plus).\n\nFrom Lawn Darts, you either need doubles to make it back to the belay or you need to make a short rap towards Peek-A-Boo tower in order to find an intermediate rappel station (solid gear).  The last rappel of Yard Art is 120' but you can down climb the gully just to the right of the belay ledge.","location":"The route is located on Peek-A-Boo Tower just to the right of Duty Dome and Warrior Wall.  Park at a small pull off just east of Icicle Buttress on the south (River) side of the road.  Directly across the road is a steep trail leading past some boulders and directly up to Duty Dome Area (visible from the road).  10-15 minutes up the trail is a fork to left for Fish Wall and to the right for Duty Dome, Warrior, Peek-A-Boo and Keen Acres.  Another 10 minutes is another fork to the right for Keen Acres.  Stay left and should arrive to the start of Yard Art in about 30 minutes (from road).  Trail is clear, but beyond Fish Wall the trail is steep and full of scree and kitty litter (not good for dogs)."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.749Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.749Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,04e395a7-b62f-5055-b5c3-e0a7b724df28,1a4b9fe5-403c-5a9c-b802-1d0ab5e68e1d,d689bada-4c59-5de7-a579-002503e7de66,4e8880c9-75fa-5900-aab0-ce18dd0b45d6","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Leavenworth","Icicle Creek","Duty Dome - Warrior Wall - Peek-a-boo Area","Peek-a-boo Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":4,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.74655,47.54891]},"bbox":[-120.747216202127,47.54846033981814,-120.74588379787298,47.549359660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105940717","area_id":"ToiAyXX6WQCqsM4Y3QtF1g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:09.092Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:56.669Z"}
