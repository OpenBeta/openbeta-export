The North Face is an amazing route with unique views of the Icicle and the Enchantmens. I felt there was not a stand out crux and the climbing throughout both pitches was consistent and very enjoyable.\n\nThe Climb originally took the left trending crack system after the first pitch. We took the Right and thought it was awesome.\n\nThere is a very empty summit log at the top waiting to get some new names on it!","protection":"Gear to 3 inches.\n\nBring plenty of pro to make belays and to protect two rope stretching pitches or consider doing it in three shorter pitches.","location":"An easy sandy gully (or snow) leads to the base. Follow the obvious large crack system, at about 60 meters the route splits and both variations are 5.7.\n\nDecent: there is an exciting 3-rappel descent to the East ending by the prominent chockstone chimney. all rappel stations are one bold with additional tat. Scramble down gully or make rappels back to base of the route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,04e395a7-b62f-5055-b5c3-e0a7b724df28,1a4b9fe5-403c-5a9c-b802-1d0ab5e68e1d,6c29a158-e8e0-5ca5-b6a7-aea161430c61","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Leavenworth","Icicle Creek","Hook Creek Drainage"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.7106,47.5427]},"bbox":[-120.71126612320576,47.542250339818146,-120.70993387679424,47.543149660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107617394","area_id":"bCmhWOjgXKW2p66hYUMMYQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-120.71126612320576,47.542250339818146],[-120.70993387679424,47.542250339818146],[-120.70993387679424,47.543149660181875],[-120.71126612320576,47.543149660181875],[-120.71126612320576,47.542250339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:55.516Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:27.496Z"}
