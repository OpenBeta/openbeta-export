The rock is finer grain than that found in the first cluster of boulders.\n\nStart sitting or crouched with your hands on two horizontal crimps, and your feet on low chips trying not to touch the pad beneath you. Work your way up through the crimps, a palmy left leaning rail, and finish via the cool horn and insecure topout.\n\nIt's called the Slot because a smaller boulder (that broke off, creating the line) follows the climb behind.\n\nEither use a lot of trickery to get through this thing (v6), or grab the couple crimps available, and pull really hard (v6). Choose Your Own Adventure.","protection":"3 pads. 1-2 for the jumbled rocks at the base, 1-2 for the ramp and landing above.","location":"After finding the first cluster of boulders, look straight uphill. You will see a couple of boulders that look like there is no way they could hold a steep line. One of them is split by a vertical crack.\n\nStumble awkwardly through a jumble of dead and burnt trees and branches, and continue uphill, watching for a steep climb that fits the description."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:15.118Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:15.118Z"},{"_id":"rjXI+VFBUAKNHiCGkoYVSA==","name":"Shrimp Traveler","yds":"V6","grades":{"vscale":"V6","yds":"V6","font":"7A"},"fa":"Cole Allen","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":true,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.72751,47.54186]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"109593035","mp_crag_id":"108150410","areaRef":"6EieE7aWVIGbW8ReJVEKvg=="},"content":{"description":"Start with hands on the crimper rail about head high.

Start seated with your hands somehow using the blocky hold, and perhaps a sloper. Work straight up to the big pinch with a great thumb-catch, and cut left, working through a horn-feature, a cool undercling, a ergonomically friendly crimp, and big flakes to the left. Top out by rocking around the corner on the high left side using the good flakes and rounded feet.\n\nInterestingly, Quantum Mechanics was first climbed with very different beta. The start was on the low center crimp, and it powered up to the right. On the FA, the undercling was not used. This beta is much more difficult (i.e.: was given double digit v-grade) than what is commonly used now. I've posted what 3 locals told me it goes at, but the grade is still settling. The direct start, from the low center crimp, going straight up into the undercling, has not been completed.","protection":"Several pads and one spotter, or a couple pads and an unusually motivated spotter.","location":"5 minutes uphill and right from The Slot.
