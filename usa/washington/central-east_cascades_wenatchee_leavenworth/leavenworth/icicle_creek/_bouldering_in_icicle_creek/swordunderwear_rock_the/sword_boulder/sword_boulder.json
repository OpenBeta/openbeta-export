I found that starting low and wide directly beneath the arete offered the cleanest take off. 5 or 6 moves of beautiful climbing leads to the physical crux. After the crux you gain a good juggy crimp rail. Take a breathe and execute a secondary crux move that is technically easier but slightly more physical. Take a breathe, you still have another boulder problem to do.  At this point you should be able to get both feet on the face and start face climbing. Trend up and left via big moves on good crimp-jugs before moving back to the arete with your right hand. Do a committing move to a left hand jug on the lip and top out to the right.  Exquisite movement on a gorgeous block.","protection":"Excellent decision making skills, common sense, endurance, experience, a TR, a sea of pads, walking away.

I opted to just list it in the Sword section to reduce clutter but it somehow has moved to the Hourglass boulder.
