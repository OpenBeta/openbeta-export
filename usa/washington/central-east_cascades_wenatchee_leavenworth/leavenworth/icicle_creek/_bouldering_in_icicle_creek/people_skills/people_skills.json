The problem was centered around a rather sharp flake and a move from it up left to a terrible sloping gaston rail. Now that the flake is gone it may be completely impossible. I wanted to add it here because it's an interesting piece of history and it provided some serious entertainment for a handful of us in the past. Apparently, the stand start from the rail is still occasionally done, but it's not quite as classy (or difficult) as the original.","protection":"A crash pad or two, but it's probably unclimbable now in any case.","location":"The route starts low at a juggy undercling/sidepull. It used to pull up left to a sharp flake, then into a sloping rail (crux) and to edges at the top. Without the sharp flake (which now lies at the base of the boulder), this problem will likely fade into history or be resurrected as a V-impossible if someone \"finds\" micro-edges they can pull on."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.948Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.948Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,04e395a7-b62f-5055-b5c3-e0a7b724df28,1a4b9fe5-403c-5a9c-b802-1d0ab5e68e1d,ec426459-bba7-541c-8411-63952095bef2,206f6e28-f3b3-588f-8c69-0eaa68bc56d3","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Leavenworth","Icicle Creek","** Bouldering in Icicle Creek","People Skills"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V-easy"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.72751,47.54186]},"bbox":[-120.72817611253245,47.541410339818135,-120.72684388746754,47.542309660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107944474","area_id":"IG9uKPOzWI+MaQ6qaLxW0w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:09.490Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:57.127Z"}
