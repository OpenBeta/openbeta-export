Pretty dirty, lots of pine needles, and thirty feet tall. But there isn't much that goes to the top of this boulder, so you get a different perspective of the area from up there. It's also notable for it's downclimb - a slip and slide off a ramp and onto an adjacent boulder. Also pretty fun bc it's about 20-30 feet tall, so there's a touch of commitment.","protection":"Place a pad on the boulder you jump down onto, and then carefully downclimb until you are above the pad, and jump down onto that baby.","location":"The tall boulder across the street from the Lovage boulder. It's the first large boulder you come to in Upper Forestland, but on your left. Look for the easiest line up the face that faces Lovage, and work your way up somewhat dirty ledges of super solid rock."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,04e395a7-b62f-5055-b5c3-e0a7b724df28,1a4b9fe5-403c-5a9c-b802-1d0ab5e68e1d,ec426459-bba7-541c-8411-63952095bef2,cdeef320-8057-5d6d-b732-a142c1e4b6ac,af8cfd1d-71a8-5eb2-9c4e-9a1d05f0ecfa","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Leavenworth","Icicle Creek","** Bouldering in Icicle Creek","Forestland Boulders","Tall Unknown Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.73259,47.54527]},"bbox":[-120.733256155864,47.54482033981813,-120.73192384413598,47.54571966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120279701","area_id":"r4z9HXGoXrKcTpodBfDs+g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:58.065Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:55.381Z"}
