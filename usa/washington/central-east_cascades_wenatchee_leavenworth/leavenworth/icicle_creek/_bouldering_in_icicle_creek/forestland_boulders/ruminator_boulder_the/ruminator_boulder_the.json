Psych yourself up, and finish up and left around the corner. This is a proud climb.\n\nThe finish straight up through the sloper on the even-taller face is an impossibly amazing v10 variant - Cremation of Care.","protection":"Depends on your comfort level. The hardest moves are near the ground, and you'll want maybe 2 good pads for that. When you get high, you're less likely to fall, but the landing is stepped, and it's tall as shit. So if you wanted to be able to bail or fall, you'd want another 3 big pads, probably.","location":"Around the corner to the right and uphill from The Physical.
