Powerful movement between perfect open handed holds gives the climb a lot of character, and it climbs so well when done correctly. The hard part is that there are a lot of moves on it, and that one of the hardest moves is the last one.\n\nIt's also quite popular with visiting climbers, so you're almost likely to run into someone from outside the states or a different region of the country as you are someone who lives on the west side of the Cascades.","protection":"3-4 pads.","location":"In Upper Forestland. Walk through Lower, past the Cowardly Lion boulder, then swing a left, and hike up a steep eroding hill. Pass through big boulder until you can identify the Physical, sloping steep holds on the right. Cut right, pass under the truly awesome Ruminator, and then around the corner to the right of this boulder. Stay uphill on a trail that skirts around the boulderfield, and then follow the trail back down to the back of a big boulder. On this boulder, you will find Coffee Cup and Practitioner, among others. Practitioner is the gorgeous overhung squeeze block with a stepped landing."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ifOLHXEnV72xfJlwilA+hA==","name":"The Coffee Cup","yds":"V9","grades":{"yds":"V9","font":"7C","vscale":"V9"},"fa":"Ben Shrope, 2002","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.7329,47.54575]},"left_right_index":55,"mp_id":"107275448","mp_crag_id":"120249388","climb_id":"ifOLHXEnV72xfJlwilA+hA==","areaRef":"1+MKWoJBVuqdI3xGQClVOg=="},"content":{"description":"Pure, powerful, beautiful, The Coffee Cup is an elegant hard problem.\n\nBegin on the lowest rail, and work through just three powerful moves on awesome sloping edges.
