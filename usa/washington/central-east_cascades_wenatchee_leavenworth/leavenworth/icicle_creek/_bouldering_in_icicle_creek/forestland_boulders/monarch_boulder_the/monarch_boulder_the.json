It's in a stunning and unique natural space. What more could you ask for? For me, it's the perfect boulder problem.\n\nThe landing is flat, if a bit damp. An additional challenge is that the conditions should probably be at least decent because the pinch is temp-dependent, which are hard to get because it's in a (beautiful) wetland.\n\nPlease take care to only use what space you need in this gorgeous natural space. Right now, there is plenty of room to get to the boulder and work on it - no need to damage any more plant life in there, so please tread cautiously.","protection":"2-3 pads","location":"Climb is just to the left of Trickle of Silence, and finishes on the same holds.
