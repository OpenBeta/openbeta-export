Both seem about the same difficulty to me.","protection":"Pads. Landing is mostly flat but if you choose to go out right around the corner you'll be over some bushes and a fun stab-tastic spike rock. So definitely protect that guy.","location":"Same boulder as Max Attacks. About halfway between the Yosemite Highball boulder and the Nosebleed boulder there's a trail that heads in the uphill direction.
