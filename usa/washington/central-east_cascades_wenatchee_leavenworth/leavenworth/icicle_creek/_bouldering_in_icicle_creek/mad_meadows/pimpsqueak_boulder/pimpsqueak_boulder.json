Lines don't get any more pure or aesthetic than this, and the movement ranges from technical, to gymnastic, to purely powerful as you progress from start to finish.\n\nStart by climbing the arete on good holds to the flat edge at the beginning of the roof.  Set your feet and fire your right hand out behind you to a good sloper on the arete.  From here, a mix of squeezing, heel-hooking, and scumming will bring you to the crux throws at the end.  Toss for the finishing jug then make a couple more delicate moves to top out.","protection":"A few pads and at least 1 attentive spotter.
