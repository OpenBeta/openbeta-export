Climbing it without this assistance was, no kidding, much much harder.\n\nIt starts with a visually attractive section of polished crmips, a nice jug, a crimp sidepull, and a cruxy throw into a slot. Use your feet well.\n\nYou may find that the climbing above is still stopper, as there isn't much chalk, and the holds and sequence is inobvious. It is a bit heady up there. Aim for the crack on the left, and make sure you have a good spot. There are decent fingerlocks in that thing.\n\nJudging by the chalk, most people don't get past the jug. I'd give it more stars, but it kinds of sucks to work on this problem unless you have someone to help out with the pad, and the top out is really not all that fun. Also, it's fairly temperature dependent, because it's so slick. Do it if you've done basically everything else in Mad Meadows. Most areas this would be a good climb. In the pantheon that is Mad Meadows, it feels kind of turdy.\n\n\"Occam's\" is one of the ways this cognitive device is commonly spelled, but the philosopher who developed the idea was William of Ockham: “plurality should not be posited without necessity.”","protection":"One or two pads. To start, have someone standing at the base of the pad to keep it from sliding down.
