Climb right over the bad landing, making a couple big cruxy bump moves to another rectangular slot, then make a couple more moves which eventually lead to doing an awesome meatwrap move to the upper side of the lip, finishing with a \"heartbreakingly\" tough mantle. Very morpho - this route may feel like V9 if you're shorter.\n\nThis cool hidden gem is apparently in the top 5 list of best V7s in Leavenworth according to Sheridan's guidebook, but I didn't think it's\n\nthat\n\ngood. I'm just giving it four stars due to its purity and aesthetic even if it isn't that popular.\n\nLow start is V9 and there exist multiple variations on the boulder, with the normal V7 line being the \"safest\" - but the landing is still bad.","protection":"The landing is pretty rough and you would need to protect the uneven boulders under the mantle area. 5 pads will make you very comfortable.","location":"Big triangle boulder. Find it by turning right slightly down the slope when hiking up to the main Mad Meadows boulders. Turn right in that flat meadow area into a faint trail heading straight to Leavenworth a couple minutes before the main boulders."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,04e395a7-b62f-5055-b5c3-e0a7b724df28,1a4b9fe5-403c-5a9c-b802-1d0ab5e68e1d,ec426459-bba7-541c-8411-63952095bef2,2124746b-6723-5bbd-bb4a-cd95b4b2251b,74a87b5c-83bc-5b49-8988-3656c41bbd40","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Leavenworth","Icicle Creek","** Bouldering in Icicle Creek","Mad Meadows","Heartbreaker Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.72314,47.54248]},"bbox":[-120.72380612041034,47.542030339818126,-120.72247387958966,47.542929660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119102104","area_id":"dKh7XIO8W0mJiDZWxBu9QA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-120.72380612041034,47.542030339818126],[-120.72247387958966,47.542030339818126],[-120.72247387958966,47.542929660181855],[-120.72380612041034,47.542929660181855],[-120.72380612041034,47.542030339818126]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:58.062Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:08:41.155Z"}
