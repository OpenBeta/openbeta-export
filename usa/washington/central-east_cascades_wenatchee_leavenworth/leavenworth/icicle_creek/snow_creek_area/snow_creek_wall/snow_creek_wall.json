Starts at the base of Snow Creek Wall and follows fantastic features up through the main shield to the top. This can be crowded, but it's a good place to chill and look at the view. Pretty easy to identify this route on the wall, because of the long, well-cleaned crack splitting the upper headwall. Follow that crack down to a ledge with a big cedar growing out of it. The regular start is the ledge/dihedral system about 80 feet right and 100 feet down from the end of that ledge.\n\nP1-P2 (5.7): An easy corner/scramble to a ledge. From the ledge, traverse down and left to the huge ledge with the big tree; you'll probably have to do a little easy simulclimbing to do this as one pitch. There's also several fun variations starting further left that are a bit harder, but would allow you to pass a really slow party on the first pitch.\n\nP3 (5.9): From the ledge, either head up a steep crack with juggy flakes (some are a bit hollow) or start from the left up a dihedral. Either way, you end up at a roof. Step out to the right (this is airy and fun, with great pro) and follow the crack out right until it heads up again. Be careful of drag. Belay on a nice sloping ledge.\n\nP4 (5.8). Head up and left on an easy slab peppered with knobs toward a right-facing dihedral. Get into the dihedral (crux of this pitch), top out, and traverse left to another ledge. Watch out for rope drag on this, too. Longer than it looks.\n\nP5 (5.7). The money pitch. Go up the obvious crack that splits the shield. One of the most enjoyable pitches in the world, I think. You'll giggle the whole way up. It's 130 feet long (?). You can jam in any of the bomber, perfect jams along the way, or if you get tired of that, step onto the stair-like knobs peppering the face. Sublime. And it ends on a perfect ledge with a separate crack to set an anchor. Gear wise might want to bring triples in hand size as its easy to run out of gear here\n\nP6 (5.9). Keep following the crack. A little \"bouldery\" crack move gets you off the ledge, then it's cruiser jamming to the top. Getting all the way to the top in one pitch from here will stretch a 60m rope. You may have to stop on the slab to bring up your second before you actually hit the top and trees. Don't sweat it, though. There's room for gear everywhere.\n\nFrom here, there is a rap route, or scramble down the gullies on the left (as you're facing the wall). Follow the cairns all the way (well marked).

Although the climbing is technically more moderate than Outer Space, the combination of exposure, route-finding challenges, and the occasional runout section combine to provide a spicy feel beyond the grade.\n\nWith the exception of pitch 1, all pitches put your climber out of line-of-sight, and out of earshot.\n\nPitch 0: 5.6, 180 feet. Scramble up to the large tree slightly right of the Mary Jane dihedral. Move left and enter a 4th class gully. Follow this up toward the distinctive 'hanging' tree at the top. Sling the flake and/or the tree.  (Some route descriptions omit this pitch, or call it the scramble to the first belay station.)\n\nPitch 1: 5.8+, 90 feet. Move right of the tree to the main ledge and proceed up corners and slabs to the crux of this pitch, an 'awkward' roof which can be negotiated via the slab on the left, or stemming high and pulling over the roof.  Once past this, climb 30 easy feet to a small ledge directly below the Mary Jane dihedral.\n\nPitch 2: 5.8 - 5.9, 150 feet. Find the easy overhung traverse moving left and up at a diagonal.  After 90 feet or so, you'll find yourself at the foot of a fantastic 5.9 finger crack system which presents the technical crux of the pitch, in the form of another 'awkward' transition leftward when the finger crack system peters out.\n\nSet belay on the ramp with bushes above the finger crack, and chill in the slot behind the large flake. (an alternate to the crack system is to continue traversing left, then climb up low-fifth class blocks to the belay).\n\nPitch 3: 5.8+, 180 feet. Take an airy, exposed step up and right to a slab which progresses about 40 feet up to a roof.  Clip the bolt, skip the buttonhead, and when the slab begins to roof out, move right around the arete.\n\nIf the fingercracks of the prior pitch are the technical crux of the route, the face climbing above the arÃªte in this pitch are the mental crux.  Proceed directly up the face (small cams for pro here) through some fun mantling moves to a dihedral with a small ledge and vertical and horizontal cracks.  This will be your most-exposed feeling belay station.\n\nPitch 4: 5.8, 90 feet. From your belay, climb straight up the dihedral. When crack in the corner runs out, move up and to the right to gain the knobby face, and marvel at the beginning of a sea of chickenheads.  Pull over an easy roof and continue up the 5.5 face to the large ledge with an overhanging roof and obvious right ramp.  Belay from the ledge.\n\nPitch 5: 5.6, 200 feet. Move up the ramp on the right side of the ledge and marvel at the endless chickenheads in front of you.  Pro is very sparse- sling the occasional chickenhead- and move generally left, following the easiest path. Climbing will become progressively easier from here, and eventually you'll reach 3rd-class jumbles of blocks- go as far as you have rope and set belay.\n\nPitch 6: low 5th, 150 feet. Climb generally up and left toward the top, then head right up one of the gullies to the sandy summit.\n\nDescent: From the summit, move left to find the cairn-marked descent trail, which will lead you across the top of the gully at the base of the wall and onto the rib across from the wall.  Take a moment to enjoy the view, and follow the cairn-trail down.  Some of this will be 4th class scrambing but if done right will not require a rappel.\n\nNear the bottom, enter a narrow gully and work left (back toward your packs).  A short scramble (watch for the cairns!) over a fin ridge will gain you the flank at the foot of the wall- continue down and left until you reach your starting point.  If you proceed too far, you'll be cliffed out.","protection":"Gear to 3\" with an emphasis on finger and small hand sizes, double set of nuts","location":"Follow the climber's trail from the snow creek trail up to the base of Outer Space.

Rack up here, stash your packs, and say hello to the goat welcoming committee. Scramble up and left over easy terrain toward a large evergreen below the prominent Mary Jane dihedral. Use the gully to looker's left of the hanging tree for easiest access.
