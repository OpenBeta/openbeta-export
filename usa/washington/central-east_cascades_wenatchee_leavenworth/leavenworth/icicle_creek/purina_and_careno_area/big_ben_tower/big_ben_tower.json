The crux is the roof move after the slab on the first pitch.\n\n2nd pitch starts wide right off the belay, maybe 5.9, then mostly 5.8 hand crack. After the big ledge and bush there are a couple of options. I went straight up a over hanging crack, maybe 5.9.\n\nI would give this 3 stars but it was pretty dirty.","protection":"Gear to 4\". Double up with 1\"- 3\" cams","location":"Starts at the very lowest toe of buttress , sort of inside corner, steep blocky, then low angle and old bolt on slab traversing left to gain the chimney where the 2nd pitch goes. There is a good belay pedestal after pulling the roof move. There is an old 1/4\" star drive anchor at the top of the tower, rap down back side(north)."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.524Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:14.524Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,04e395a7-b62f-5055-b5c3-e0a7b724df28,1a4b9fe5-403c-5a9c-b802-1d0ab5e68e1d,0887db5a-7b6a-5239-8921-ef0032323403,cd675d46-6eaa-57a3-b069-b197d32ffa8e","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Leavenworth","Icicle Creek","Purina and Careno Area","Big Ben Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.70335,47.55194]},"bbox":[-120.70401624064411,47.55149033981815,-120.70268375935588,47.55238966018189],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108617695","area_id":"zWddRm6qV6OwabGX0y/6jg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:08.895Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:56.291Z"}
