Best to start off a boat or paddle board or something. A traverse in from the right may be possible. Would likely add a grade or two. Follow an obvious right facing rail feature up and left to a pretty good rest before the crux. A couple moves right and up from there takes you through the crux sequence which finishes with a big reach to a rail feature that runs up and to the right and puts you directly above the start. From here the climbing eases significantly. Follow the rail to a flake/block, get on top of that thing and finish up however you wish. I went up and right because it was the cleanest but all options are pretty easy from here. Be careful with the block, it's big and didn't seem loose but the very left side sounded a little hollow and I didn't love the look of it. I forgot to bring anything to pry with when I cleaned the route but I would have tried to take it off if I had. I pulled as hard as I could, stomped, kicked, and jumped on it (while cleaning on top rope) and it didn't move. The route never goes under it and it's a DWS so there's no belayer but probably worth treading lightly as you mantel the rail. You'll need to step across the block. I might just be paranoid but FYI.","protection":"Deep water. Everything about 35ft up and higher is pretty easy.","location":"Route starts maybe 30ft to the right of the left arete on a flat edge. Goes up and left a bit but ultimately cuts right to traverse pretty far right of the start. Just follow the features, it's fairly obvious."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:15.582Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:15.582Z"},{"_id":"P39svR6eUsi6qFo6fHCt9A==","name":"Marshall's Strain","yds":"5.10c","grades":{"yds":"5.10c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Marshall Lewis","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.33885,48.04012]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"114945394","mp_crag_id":"114587953","areaRef":"GFE+g/CtVamG16/amQDE9Q=="},"content":{"description":"","protection":"Deep Water Solo, S0","location":""},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:15.582Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:15.582Z"},{"_id":"bTsNEkK0ULmpiLnZ0Pqs5Q==","name":"Hummingbird","yds":"5.11-","grades":{"yds":"5.11-","french":"6c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":false,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.33885,48.04012]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"115146077","mp_crag_id":"114587953","areaRef":"GFE+g/CtVamG16/amQDE9Q=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the double crack system left of Beehive Crack. Tricky sidepulls, underclings, and not crimpy. Still good movement and a project for June-September! The crack is shallow in certain areas, has beautiful bushes I have left in. I incorporated underclings, and high steps, and drop-knees. Top out above on the slanting edge to the right, Â that reaches the 40 foot mark. The first ascent of this was as early season as it could get, so I had good friction on the rock. This season also add about 5 feet of climbing to the wall.
