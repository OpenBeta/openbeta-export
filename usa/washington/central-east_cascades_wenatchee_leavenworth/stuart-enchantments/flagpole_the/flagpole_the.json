The bolts on the ladder are old and somewhat dodgy looking.  I used tie offs through some of the hangars as they were unable to accommodate regular biners.  Although these days of very low profile biners that may not be an issue anymore.  The top anchor is nice and new and very reliable.  The exposure on this route is memorable.","protection":"Light alpine rack is all that's needed and basic aid gear.  One etrier would provably suffice, or even just standing in slings if you have a long reach.  I remember having to top step at least once.","location":"See opening page for location."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,a8c59bca-3e16-5c23-ac90-29fe05ec3580,b8dd7bec-4ee1-51ef-ac0c-2778f2ea9c32,d8f9468e-0c61-565f-9619-1a6b6e34f104","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-East Cascades, Wenatchee, & Leavenworth","Stuart-Enchantments","Flagpole, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.85814,47.48743]},"bbox":[-120.85880542196114,47.486980339818146,-120.85747457803889,47.487879660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110173601","area_id":"2PlGjgxhVl+WGRprbjTxBA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:31:00.553Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:55.710Z"}
