Crux is 2nd pitch.\n\nPitches:\n\nP1 (5.10-, 180ft) - Climb up 5.8 slab to corner which is fun and protects well - crux is 5.10-. Belay at the orange\n\nwall. There's a big horn 10ft below the orange rock.\n\nP2 (5.10, 180ft) - Step out right and into crack (fairly heady move) @ 5.10b/c. Continue up widening crack to a short off-width. A #3 cam fits in the back half way up, but the last ten feet it is useful to have a #5 if you are not comfortable with offwidth. Continue up to left facing hand crack, 5.10. Belay at the end here on horn, semi-hanging belay or with a 70 continue straight up for another ~25m on face holds and cracks to a blocky belay.\n\nP3 (5.10-, 115ft) Straight up cracks on the prow. Veer left at an angling ramp to a great belay ledge.\n\nP4 (5.8+, 130ft) - Starts with a hidden traverse on jugs, then move straight right for 25'. Pull right under a hanging arÃªte into splitter hands and fists not visible from below. Don't be tempted to go up the first cracks you see, if you keep going right you'll get to the great hand crack.\n\nP5 (5.10-, 115ft) - Starts with easy cracks, and aim for the awesome steep headwall with a left arching splitter finger crack and wild knobs. When the finger cracks peters out you move up and right on knob jugs to the tower's prow. Belay here where it joins with the last pitch of Acid Baby.\n\nP6 (5.9, 130ft) - This is also the last pitch of Acid Baby. A wild ridge traverse with great exposure leads you to the top of a gully. Stick to the top for maximum fun.\n\nDescent: Go up and around one more rock buttress and up and over a small col. Go down the chossy gully. There's a little 5.0 non-exposed downclimbing, and traverse on some ledges aiming for a small lake. Continue traversing to join the Aasgard Pass trail.\n\nAlternatively continue up further to a larger chossy gully and down to the small lake and on to the trail.","protection":"Double rack to 3\" and a #5 if you want to protect a 10' offwidth section.","location":"To the left of Acid Baby"},"__v":0},{"_id":"WYRZvjhqVceM20GOyO8cRg==","name":"Acid Baby","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Mike Layton, Dan Cappellini, Rolf Larson (July 2005)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.82188,47.48368]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"109928434","mp_crag_id":"109928429","climb_id":"WYRZvjhqVceM20GOyO8cRg==","areaRef":"q7hZP+lNVEKbZb466KKGQw=="},"content":{"description":"Acid Baby is one of the finest alpine rock climbs in the Stuart Range.
