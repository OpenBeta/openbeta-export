Traverse across the narrow, exposed ledge and belay below the obvious flaring chimney (low 5th).\n\nP2 (~30'/10m): Climbing the flaring chimney to the summit where there is a small tree and some gear options.\n\nTwo pitches are recommended despite the length due to the wandering nature of the first pitch.\n\nA single double rope rappel easily reaches the ground. An intermediate rappel could be set up. Be careful of the rope eating snag when you pull the rope.\n\nThe route does not see a lot of traffic and has a lot of lichen and is very slippery when wet. It started snowing just before we began climbing and by the end it was too slippery to do much of anything.","protection":"Small rack to 3\".
