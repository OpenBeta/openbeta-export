Jams/locks and side-pulls, with good feet all along. The position is absolutely fantastic, and the climbing great. If you own a canoe and live in Washington state, this line should be near the top of your list!\n\nThe biggest challenge of climbing this route is canoe logistics. You can anchor the canoe to the rock with gear in the lower cracks. Rather than rappel the route (which would require pulling the rope, and having it land in the water), lower one climber to the canoe and have the other walk off the top to meet the canoeist on the lowlands north of the Bastion.\n\nThe route unfortunately faces a straight where speedboats really seem to enjoy gunning it, so waves can be a nuisance on a busy boating day.","protection":"Gear to 3 inches.
