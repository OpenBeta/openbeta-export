You're probably not going to fall because of the difficulty of the moves, but a fall due to a hold exploding is very realistic.\n\nDon't let this detract you from the climb- it's not amazing, but def worth doing for the lieback sequence up top.\n\nGEAR BELAY: the gear belay is on the climbers left about 2' below the mesa top. Bring a #4 and a 0.5 for sure; I also plugged an offset 0.5/0.75 BD cam adjacent/right of the 0.5 in the same slot. See pic- it's really your only option, otherwise I wouldn't spray so much gear beta.","protection":">Singles #0.2, #0.3, #1, #3, #4 for gear anchor\n\n>>Doubles: #0.4, #0.5, #0.75, #2*.\n\n>>>If you own an offset #0.5/0.75 (purple/green), bring it for the anchor.\n\nTriples of #2 might be nice if you want to sew it up like I did because of the rock quality. I had to get more creative without a third, but it was fine.","location":"The crack climb two cracks right of Jagged Edge.

The route begins with an interesting set of face moves to get over a bulge that’s in your face from the start. Once you’re able to get into the crack, you’ll find that it’s width varies as it curves back and forth up the column. This makes for some interesting mini-cruxes that will eventually lead you to wider climbing with a fun top out move.\n\nThere is a lot of loose rock on this route that tempts you as face holds offering an alternative to the sting of the offwidth, but it’s best to stay in the crack not just from a purist perspective, but also for safety. Using the face throughout the climb will result in a 5.7 rating, while you will get a 5.9 from staying in the crack.\n\nRight now, the best way to anchor is to redirect the rope through a BD #3 in the corner crack above and to the back of the column and then run through the chains at the top of The Jagged Edge 5.7.\n\nUltimately, chains need to be installed on the left wall directly over the route for a less complicated rope situation.","protection":"Gear from 3-12”.
