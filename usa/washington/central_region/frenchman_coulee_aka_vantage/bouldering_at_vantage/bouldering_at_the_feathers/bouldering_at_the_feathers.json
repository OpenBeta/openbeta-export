It is very important to not use the other column or else this is a very easy route v2 probably. At first glance it may seem that there is nothing here to get you up, but have faith God has given you what you need to top out. Start with left hand in a micro pocket on the south face of the boulder. Right hand on a barely outcropping sidepull bump on the south corner of the boulder. The route consists of sidepulling, microcrimps, shitty feet, and some decently dynamic moves. It is a lot fun to project and figure out.","protection":"1 pad, spotter not essential","location":"This is in the most central location at The Feathers possible.

The only problem where you are actually climbing on a roof, albeit a short one, that is parallel to the ground. You start with good feet and an incut semi juggy crimp and another crimp for your right hand. Get to the jug ledge just above where the roof ends using the very large crack to keep yourself attached to the under cut wall. Footwork is imperative for making the transition to the roof. You will be parallel with the ground so having a spotter is important to have if you end up falling backside down. The second most difficult move is transitioning to the roof. The crux is making the finishing move to the ledge from the crack. I had a lot of fun projecting this with my buddy and I'm sure you will too. It could be harder than V4, if you think it is comment below.","protection":"1 pad, 1-2 spotters.","location":"The location of this route is very easy to find. It is on the north side (\n\nthe dark side\n\n) of the columns there on the eastern end that is a little higher than all the other routes there.
