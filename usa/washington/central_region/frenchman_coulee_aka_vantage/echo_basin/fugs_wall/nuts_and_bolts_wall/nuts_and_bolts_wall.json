In my attempt to sample at least one or two climbs in each \"wall\" at Fugs wall I sought out this and found a new 1/2\" SS anchor on the climb next to it and with a cam directional it was easy to TR.\n\nIn it's current condition it would be a serious lead. The 2 buttonhead/ SMC hanger bolts look solid ( well, as solid as 1/4\" bolts go) but the rock they are in is highly fractured.\n\nI cleaned all the really loose rock away, but did not replace the bolts.. If the bolts were replaced I would remove the R rating.With the anchor next to it, it did not need it's own anchor.\n\nThat said it is a really fun, with a very hard sequence past the 2nd bolt.\n\nThe crack above this is good and quite a bit easier.","protection":"the crack is about 50' of hand and finger size.","location":"Around the corner ( right/west) from the Piton Traverse.
