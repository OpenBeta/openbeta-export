No anchor, but good cam options from #.5- #2. at the top.","location":"It is pretty difficult to explain where this is. The most obvious landmark is a roof about 30' east of this that were formed when the lower rock blew out and is a decades old rock slide, and then this route looks like a wide chimney on the left side of a narrow prow that juts out.
