Story has it Andy Fitz installed the anchors back in the early 90's and then lost interest.  Fast forward a few years to 2004 when Dale Fleshman and JIm Yoder led the rig calling it 5.10b/C2.  The line finally saw an attempt but once again was dismissed.  It is now a fully equipped route ready for laps!  I can't believe it took this long for the route to see a proper send.  I looked long and hard at the top hoping it would not need bolts but after serious consideration and consultation I decided to get the drill. It really is a good route and should get better with traffic. The climbing starts with some generic crack climbing to a ledge (same one as wildcat).  From here gain the finger crack (which protects well with small to medium nuts) and climb this to the horizontal break.  Once you leave the horizontal break get set for the bolted portion of the climb which involves shallow stemming, smears and edge work with your feet while crimping edges, pulling on the arete and using the crack (when you can) for your hands. Fun!","protection":"4 bolts and Gear to .75 inches with a red camelot (or similar sized unit) for the bottom will get you to the chains.
