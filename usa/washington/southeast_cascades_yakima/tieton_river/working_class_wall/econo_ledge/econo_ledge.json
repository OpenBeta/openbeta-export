Good knot, check. Wife beater tank top, check. Cutt-off jeans, check. Okay...Time to get to work.\n\nBegin by moving up through the roof feature by making some big reaches to big holds until you arrive at a nice perch at the 4th bolt. From here continue up the face on good incut holds to the base of a small roof. Once at the roof you can rest on a huge jug, if you can find it (Hint: you might have to reach behind the washing machine to find your daddy's stash). Now it is party time, take the roof straight on and continue up the face on cryptic crimps and sidepulls to the glory jugs just below the chains.\n\nOh yeah!

Alas, the holds are much better than expected and just when the hands get thin, feet appear to support you.  Although the climbing is gently overhanging, technical and sustained, its all well within the 5.11 range. The cadence of this route is fantastic, with obvious clipping stances, fluid movement, and the best holds coming just before the final (crux) roof encounter.

If you're ready to rise above the inversion and fight for greatness, this fine new route awaits you.\n\nLike any good legend, this route starts with humble beginnings at the Econo Ledge. Clip a keeper bolt under the roof and move up to a hero jug in the broken part of the roof. Clip the perma-draw here and commit to the path ahead. There are great holds for clipping the next two bolts, but the sequences between them demand attention. The bolts eventually switch to the left side of the crack, and you'll probably want to switch your alliances as well. Your first test comes after this transition, and it wont be an easy one. Raw power and a creative spirit will be rewarded with a rest before the final battle which looms ahead. Your ultimate test comes in the form of a ten-move match, a fight that'll require courage, determination and ingenuity. If you fail here you'll find yourself experiencing the falling action first hand, but if you succeed, you'll be known around these parts as the Hop Town Hero.\n\nGently overhanging and technically demanding the whole way, this route requires equal parts endurance and creativity. While there's no single move harder than Postcard From Palmsprings, the sheer number of difficult moves brushes this one close to the 12a grade. Using the \"Tieton Sandbag Calculator\" ® this should put the listed grade at approximately 11c. Whatever the grade ends up at, there's no doubt this is a classic route for the wall.","protection":"9 quick-draws. 7 bolts, one perma-draw to steel lower-off biners.\n\nBelay bolt at the base.","location":"This is currently the farthest route right on the Econo Ledge.
