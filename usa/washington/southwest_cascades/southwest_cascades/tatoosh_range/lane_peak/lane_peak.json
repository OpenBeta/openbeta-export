Rainier, Adams, and St. Helens. This is the easiest route to the summit and the only viable one in the summer. The rock is loose but not a complete scree field. Pro is sparse to non-existent aside from the sturdy tree about 3/4 of the way up, but the 4th class terrain makes the route do-able with moderate risk. The beginning 200 feet or so can be protected with a fixed line from a sturdy tree. The rest of the climb is 3rd class from there.The route will be snow-covered in early season (likely still possible to ascend). Wait until around August for a snow-free ascent.","protection":"A sturdy tree about 200 feet up can be used to attach a fixed line and/or rappel. Use a 70m rope if you want to rappel to the  ground from this tree, or down climb. Not worth bringing a trad rack aside from some slings for the tree.","location":"Take the Pinnacle Peak trail starting at Reflection Lake to the ridgeline of the Tatoosh Range. From the ridge follow a climbersâ€™ trail as it winds its way west to Lane Peak. The 4th class section of rock starts on the east face of the peak approximately here: (46.7577816, -121.7523414)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,92f9a13d-6569-5e8a-bcf6-421cc787b8f4,7916d17d-080c-5901-bf30-a68e2f184158,c38688ab-a7fc-5c83-a5a8-94ce2e353646,27663522-448d-5923-b0f3-81953ba51c96","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Southwest Cascades","Southwest Cascades","Tatoosh Range","Lane Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.7532,46.7581]},"bbox":[-121.75385636155437,46.75765033981814,-121.75254363844562,46.75854966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110175004","area_id":"J2Y1IkSNWSOw84GVO6Uclg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:35.688Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:25.967Z"}
