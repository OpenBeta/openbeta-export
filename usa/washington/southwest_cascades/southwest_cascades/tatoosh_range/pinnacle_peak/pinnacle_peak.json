Loose rock and scree is a serious concern on this route.\n\nPitch 1: Scramble up mostly 4 class terrain to a belay ledge with a large dead tree.\n\nPitch 2: Climb blocky terrain up to 5.5 to an obvious belay bench which features a rappel anchor going down the south face. An old piton can be clipped about a quarter of the way up the route. A traverse about half way up the pitch offers some excitement and exposure.\n\nPitch 3: Continue to the summit on mostly mellow terrain. This pitch is more of a walk up and could be done unroped or simul-climb if comfortable with the terrain. Note if pitching this out, a 60 meter rope may not make it to the true summit depending on where you set up the anchor, but the terrain is so mellow it shouldn't be an issue.","protection":"5 to 8 double runners, 2 to 4 cams in the small to mid range (e.g. 0.4,  0.75, etc.), a few nuts may also be useful.","location":"From the Castle/Pinnacle col (46.7571, -121.7305) take the obvious east ridge up Pinnacle."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,92f9a13d-6569-5e8a-bcf6-421cc787b8f4,7916d17d-080c-5901-bf30-a68e2f184158,c38688ab-a7fc-5c83-a5a8-94ce2e353646,1980371d-5925-5d64-90d9-52fbe74b3926","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Southwest Cascades","Southwest Cascades","Tatoosh Range","Pinnacle Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"},{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.73258,46.75801]},"bbox":[-121.73323636045805,46.75756033981813,-121.73192363954193,46.758459660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"115164121","area_id":"GYA3HVklXWSQ2VL750s5Jg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:35.687Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:25.949Z"}
