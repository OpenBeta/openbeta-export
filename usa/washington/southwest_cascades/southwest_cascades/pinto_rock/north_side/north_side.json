The lichen gives the rock a brilliant yellow color which is very pleasing to the eye.\n\nSidewinder is a slightly-overhung traverse with good feet, except for one crux section with tricky moves where most of your weight is on your arms. There are good holds but they take some searching. The difficulty is mostly mental and mitigated by well-placed bolts every four feet or so. The basalt climbing is similar to Exit 38 and offers a nice change of pace to the welded tuff comprising other climbs at Pinto Rock. Since it's a traverse, the route is best cleaned by a follower.\n\nOnce completed, climbers have the option of lowering from the chains to the roof lip then toproping Top Gun.","protection":"Bolts with anchor + chains","location":"Either hike around the east side of Pinto Rock or climb to the summit then rappel down the standard rap rings; they meet up with the halfway point of Clast from the Past.\n\nThe trail to the route is extremely steep and loose; I slid down on my butt when heading back to the car."},"__v":0},{"_id":"/qsoRoiQWECievxXpLQstQ==","name":"Clast from the Past","yds":"5.10b","grades":{"yds":"5.10b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Kevin Buselmeier, Jim Yoder, Brenden Sullivan, ground-up","type":{"sport":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.92476,46.32448]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"110931364","mp_crag_id":"110928210","climb_id":"/qsoRoiQWECievxXpLQstQ==","areaRef":"0F4AhGEGVqSBh8tHTTb/jg=="},"content":{"description":"P1: 5.5 - Climb right side of the big slab to chain anchors. 7 clips, 100ft\n\nP2: 5.10c/d - Clip first bolt with long draw, pulling the small roof is the crux and then easier climbing to the top. 9 clips, 80ft\n\nDescent: Rappel the route","protection":"Bolts","location":"Look for the first bolt about 8ft up on the right edge of the great huge slab."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,92f9a13d-6569-5e8a-bcf6-421cc787b8f4,7916d17d-080c-5901-bf30-a68e2f184158,16a87d90-a96d-5dd8-ae62-4474fd9430f2,d05e0084-6106-56a4-8187-cb474d36ff8e","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Southwest Cascades","Southwest Cascades","Pinto Rock","North Side"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.92476,46.32448]},"bbox":[-121.92541114026356,46.324030339818144,-121.92410885973646,46.32492966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110928210","area_id":"0F4AhGEGVqSBh8tHTTb/jg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.92541114026356,46.324030339818144],[-121.92410885973646,46.324030339818144],[-121.92410885973646,46.32492966018187],[-121.92541114026356,46.32492966018187],[-121.92541114026356,46.324030339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:36.690Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:08:15.638Z"}
