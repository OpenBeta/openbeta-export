This route begins on the prow just left of the gully for \"Bowling Alley\". The crux (if there is one) is just a quick move off the ground. From there, the climbing stays quite moderate yet enjoyable with some decent exposure in areas. Excellent route for developing your \"cobbletrust\" skills.\n\nP1: 5.7 -  Clip the first bolt overhead, mantle to small ledge and continue up the edge of a cobblestone staircase.  6 clips to chain anchor.\n\nP2: 5.6 - Shimmy across the \"camel humps\" (may want to sling the second hump), then hand traverse across very thin saddle to first bolt. Clip 5 bolts to chains.\n\n(Pitches 2 and 3 can be linked with long slings down low on the first 3 clips, 12 clips altogether 55 meters.)\n\nP3: 5.6 - Continue up through a shallow groove, up a few low slabs and then up to the large bench above. 6 clips to chains.\n\nP4: 5.8 - Down climb slightly left and step across gap to clip first bolt then continue up the \"spine\". 8 clips to a hanging belay.\n\nP5: 5.6 - Finish on the Bowling Alley. Climb through the band of basalt to a chimney, sling a cobble after second clip, then leftward up a shoot to the summit. 5 clips.\n\nDescent: From the summit, rappel off the North end of the East face from an anchor set up near a tree. Make two rappels with a 60m rope or make one double-rope rappel to the ground.\n\nNOTE: Chains are for belay and emergency exit only. Rappelling these routes can be dangerous! Be highly aware of swing potential and possibly taking your hands off the rope and climbing a bit to anchors, auto-block recommended. Most rappels are total rope-stretchers so TIE KNOTS or meet your doom!","protection":"Bolted, quickdraws and at least 3 alpine draws - 12 total","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Bc4a1KI5VpedV7KKBzNhPQ==","name":"Bowling Alley (aka Regular Route)","yds":"5.4","grades":{"yds":"5.4","french":"4a"},"fa":"Brenden Sullivan, Jim Yoder, ground-up","type":{"sport":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.92365,46.32649]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"109342321","mp_crag_id":"109342307","climb_id":"Bc4a1KI5VpedV7KKBzNhPQ==","areaRef":"We+s3aTwUPCDj6UFksqr0A=="},"content":{"description":"From the pull out, follow the trail up to the lowest toe of the formation. Then, take a left and skirt around the rock about 75ft until you arrive in a narrow gully. Due to rock fall, try not to belay or leave packs directly in the mouth of the gully.\n\nP1: 5.2 - Climb up the gully to the first bolt about 25 feet up. Continue up another 20ft to the next bolt and bare right up the gully to a belay in a saddle overlooking the east face. This is a 40m pitch. 4 or 5 boltsÂ and slings to chain anchors.\n\nP2: 5.6 - Sling a nice cantaloupe off the belay and climb directly up the vertical groove over large watermelons , traverse camel hump back onto \"Regular Route\". 11 bolts to chains under a large bench.\n\nP3: 5.4 - Climb up to a bolt and cut left across the groovy ledge and up a knobby ramp. Sling a few rocks and clip 3 bolts to chain anchors in basalt band.\n\nP4: 5.6 - The summit pitch. Climb through the band of basalt to a chimney, sling a cobble after second bolt then leftward up a low angle chute to the summit. 5 clips. Don't forget to sign the summit register!\n\nDescent: From the summit, rappel off the North end of the East face from an anchor set up near a tree.
