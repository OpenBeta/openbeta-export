Turn up &  scramble (class 3 - 4) to the top of the trees, with a nice bench for the belay point. Start up somewhat left, then right. The first 30-40 feet are difficult to impossible to protect. Work to your right to the large crack, then up until you pass around a small Alaskan Yellow Cedar. Just above the cedar, setup the upper belay on a cindery bench. From this point it is a class 3 or 4, very exposed scramble up the summit ridge. We rappelled from a rock 10 feet below the cedar.","protection":"Small to medium chocks, #3 cam.\n\nThe rappel requires 60M rope","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,92f9a13d-6569-5e8a-bcf6-421cc787b8f4,7916d17d-080c-5901-bf30-a68e2f184158,e6e0a3d8-abb6-5aec-9d51-40a0b34a9b41","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Southwest Cascades","Southwest Cascades","Shark Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.86027,46.27023]},"bbox":[-121.86092049548455,46.26978033981814,-121.85961950451545,46.270679660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113734269","area_id":"5uCj2Ku2WuydUUCgs0qbQQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:36.195Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:30.867Z"}
