In 2016 the route was freed, starting via Smoke Signals.\n\nBoth the aid climbing and free climbing descriptions and grades are provided here.\n\nAID CLIMBING OPTION\n\nPitch by pitch aid descriptions (edited 31 March 2017)\n\nPitch 1: Approximately 30 m, 5.7 C1. Start up the slab about 100 feet right of the climbing/no climbing boundary. The first pitch begins with some free climbing and progresses into aid about half way up. A few bolts are used on the head wall. Finish at a bolted belay on a grassy ledge.\n\nPitch 2: Approximately 30 m, C1F. Continue up a corner system, past a tree and follow cracks and seams to a bolt and an arching overhang, and another 2 bolts. Step up and then right past a tree with tat and progress up a bolted head wall to a 3 bolt belay. Mostly small gear on this pitch but include cams to supplement the bolts. This is the second pitch of Smoke Signals.\n\nPitch 3: 25m 5.8ish Move the belay to above the big tree on the ledge. Continue up the corner right of the anchor and through a series of ledges. Traverse left behind a large tree and continue left and up a seriously bushy ramp. Behind the bush is a double off-width crack with a bolt at the start. Belay from atop of these cracks using the first bolts of pitch 4's bolt ladder.\n\nPitch 4: 15m C0 Bolt ladder, with one hook move between bolts if you can't reach. Bolt belay at the top.\n\nPitch 5: 30m 5.6 C1F From the belay move thru easy slabby terrain clipping a couple bolts and following a fixed line to an anchor behind a tree. Head strait up on bolts to a small roof. A couple free moves and bolts get you to a pair of bolts with chains at a hanging belay.\n\nPitch 6: 25m 5.8 C1 From the hanging belay, head strait up on gear to a bolt, or head right for more free climbing. Both join together for loose free and C0 climbing to the final anchors.\n\nPitch 7: 30m Head up along 3rd class terrain and a few 5th class steps to the hikers trail on top.\n\nFREE CLIMBING OPTION\n\nThis route was free climbed in the spring of 2016 using Smoke Signals for the first pitches. Here are the details if free climbing the route.\n\nPitch 1: 5.12- 30m:  Starting in the ditch, follow a shallow right leaning ramp to get into the Stone Soup crack features. Follow this up and past a pin. The route steepens and climbs through the bolted (crux) short head wall.  Alternatively, one can climb the first pitch of Smoke Signals (5.10b).\n\nPitch 2: 5.10d 32m: Head up a weakness on the right of the anchors passing a small tree on its left side. Continue up the discontinuous crack finding good stances between reachy moves on good holds. Clip a bolt and step left on to a slab, working across the slab below a small roof towards a bolt. Climb up towards a small tree passing it on the right side and then on to the final crux head wall. The head wall has bolts, a pin and can take a couple of nuts if required. Plenty of gear can be found on this pitch. A set of offset nuts will be very useful, especially the #7/gold size.\n\nPitch 3 5.8 25m: Move the belay to above the big tree on the ledge. Continue up the short right facing corner right of the bolt and through a series of ledges. Traverse left along a ledge, behind a large tree and continue left and up towards a bush at the top of the ramp. Climb a double off-width crack with a bolt at the start. Belay from atop of these cracks from the Alice In Wonderland ledge using the first two bolts of the bolt ladder of pitch 4.\n\nPitch 4 5.12+ 25m: Ascend the bolt ladder crimping away madly and brushing lichen as you go. An alternative is to ascend a short vertical crack about 10' right of the bolt ladder and then traverse left along a hand ledge back to the bolt line. Follow the upper half of the bolt ladder still crimping on small edges and pull onto the large Swiss Family Ledge system. Continue following the low fifth class slab steps up and rightward passing a pin and a few more bolts until you reach a belay platform below the steep arete.\n\nPitch 5 5.10d 30m: Head strait up the arete following a line of bolts and pins to a small roof. Pull the roof on the left and continue up a short crack to a set of anchors at a hanging belay.\n\nPitch 6 5.9 25m: From the hanging belay, move slightly right and head up a crack on gear passing a few bolts, a pin and two more bolts. Be extremely careful of the blocks that you are climbing on as many are loose time bombs. Reach the final anchors\n\nPitch 7 4th 30m: Follow easy terrain along the ridge crest until you reach the fence adjacent to the summit trail. I","protection":"All anchors are good bolts. There are also a generous number of protection bolts on the pitches. Goes clean with a bunch of fixed pins, and even if they blew you can probably find a way up on clean gear.\n\nThanks to the pins and bolts, you don't need lots of gear to climb this route. Bring doubles from tiny through .5 C4, one or two .75, and one each 1 through 3. Didn't have to have the 3. I mostly placed small cams, grey-red C3. Bring at least one hook. I placed only one nut, but there was plenty of opportunity to place them. Offset nuts are helpful, offset cams are not useful. I did not find a large cam at all necessary in the offwidth, but if it was wet a 5 or 6 would make it easier. Don't think a 4 would help too much.","location":"From the water spigot go about 100 feet up the climber trail."},"__v":0},{"_id":"kDCGBi/4XIaqSPVb+ZPi8A==","name":"The Steamboat Captain's Dream","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"July 2018  Topher Dabrowski;  April 1999 Andrew Leiner & J.

This route is named in his honor. For more on this history, watch the short film\n\nBeacon Rock Then & Now\n\n.\n\nThe Steamboat Captain's Dream is a link up of a few existing pitches from a couple of different routes together with newly opened pitches. The line stays true with the character of the opening pitch and offers more varied and superb climbing on the way to the true summit of Beacon Rock.\n\nWhile most of Beacon Rock is closed to climbing annually from February until early July, the NW section of the rock remains open year round. This route is a great option for those looking for a multi-pitch adventure earlier in the season. The 5.10 nature of the route will keep you reaching into your bag of trad tricks and will ask for a wide variety of climbing skill as the route offers everything from low angle slab to slightly steeper terrain and thin crack to wide flakes.\n\nPitch 1\n\n5.10B, 28m\n\n-  Ascend large ledges and good holds to a wider left leaning crack. The first gear is about 20' up in this crack but the climbing is straight forward to this point. Continue up as the route zig-zags its way up the wall following a discontinuous crack system, look carefully for offset nuts and small to medium cam placements eventually reaching a stance below where the rock steepens. Here find a good cam placement in a horizontal slot to compliment the older baby angle piton. Launch into the pitch's crux by moving up, passing a bolt and then exiting left around a buttress. Once you turn the corner, look for good features and a few more gear placements as you take the slab up to a bolted anchor. Due to the nature of the rock on this pitch some of the gear placements are not obvious but they're definitely available to the skilled trad climber. Appreciate the fact that the FFA of this pitch was done without the bolt!  For the most part (except a slightly different start) this pitch was originally called\n\nSmoke Signals.\n\nPitch 2 5.10D\n\n32m\n\n- head up a weakness on the right of the anchors passing a small tree on its left side. Continue up the discontinuous crack finding good stances between reachy moves on good holds. Clip a bolt and step left on to a slab, working across the slab below a small roof towards another bolt. Climb up towards a small tree passing it on the right side and then on to the final crux head wall. The head wall has bolts, a pin and can take a couple of nuts if required. Plenty of gear can be found on this pitch. Offset nuts will be very useful on this pitch, especially the #7/gold size.\n\nMove the belay about 25' up above the trees and to a comfortable ledge with anchors.\n\nPitch 3 5.10C\n\n25m\n\n- continue up the short 15' right facing corner just right of the belay anchor and the short cracks above. Weave through a series of ledges and traverse left into a stance behind a large tree, a larger cam can be placed here. Lay back the big flake past 2 bolts and then traverse right across the face to find the next anchors just above.\n\nPitch 4 5.10A\n\n18m\n\n- climb the low angle left leaning crack passing a piton mid way. Clipping the last bolt of Stone Soup's bolt ladder at the exit is fair game if needed. Find a belay station on the face to the left after you exit on to the comfy ledge. The micro-cams are useful on this pitch.\n\nPitch 5 5.6\n\n20m\n\n- make a step up a 6' corner and follow the low angle ledges passing 2 bolts to an anchor below a steep arete and behind a tree.\n\nPitch 6 5.10C\n\n30m\n\n- head straight up the arete following a line of bolts to a small roof. Step right, through the roof and continue up the ridge past a short crack to a set of anchors above a small ledge on the face.\n\nPitch 7 5.9\n\n30m\n\n- from the belay move right and up a crack and corner system passing a bolt, a piton and another bolt. Continue following the discontinuous crack until it hits a shallow roof, step right at the roof and continue up following a couple more bolts as the terrain eases. A final belay can be found at a comfortable stance. Be careful as some of the blocks are loose.\n\nPitch 8 4th class\n\n30m\n\n- climb a couple of steps and follow the easy terrain along the ridge crest for 100' to reach the Beacon Rock trail.\n\nVARIATIONS\n\nPitch 1 var. 5.11A\n\n-\n\nA direct finish to the exit on the first pitch can be climbed. After stepping left and up from the bolt, follow a direct line to the top on good holds requiring some longer reaches. Small to medium nuts are useful for this option.

Otherwise rappel from any pitch with a 70m rope.\n\nNotes:\n\n(i) When rappelling from the anchors at the top of pitch 5, angle down the 5.6 low angle pitch to get to the top of pitch 4 and the hand lines which lead you to the next rappel anchors.\n\n(ii) From the top of pitch 2, rappel from the anchors near the edge of the wall and not the anchors behind the trees on the spacious ledge.

The route meanders all over the NW Face to follow the path of least resistance to the top.  It is characterized by mostly 3rd-class hiking on dirty ledges, with a couple of short stretches of 4th-and 5th-class rock, on which the FA party, and others shortly thereafter, fixed long iron rods into the rock to aid their ascent up these \"impossible\" sections (no harder than 5.7 by modern standards).\n\nStart hiking up a left-trending dirty 3rd-class ramp just to the left of the clean (ish) face at the base of the NW Face just above the large boulders.  The first iron spike is within 50', so you will know that you are on route.  You will reach a modern bolted anchor after about 250' on route (well-after the first switchback, and just above the first bit of 4th-class rock) that you can use to belay the crux pitch above:  60' of dirty 4th-class followed by a 40' 5.7 dihedral.  Follow the trail across the ledge, up another 15' of 5.easy rock, and walk through the perched forest before cutting back left up some 4th-class rock for 150'.
