Two of the lines start at the right side of the boulder in a sit start under the boulder. One line goes up the end of the boulder towards the back, about a V3. The 2nd line goes out to the front of the boulder, and up the obvious pockets and crimps and is a V2 called Cheap Date. Left side of the boulder has a V3ish line that also starts with a sit start and goes up the crimps and pockets.","protection":"Pads and a spotter to watch your head as you come out of the little cave.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"uc92roctX6am8DKACjdaPA==","name":"Cheap Date","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.03412,45.64311]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"110273305","mp_crag_id":"119081597","climb_id":"uc92roctX6am8DKACjdaPA==","areaRef":"FpdYOeZvXW2SlPrWHvNTLw=="},"content":{"description":"SDS climb the tip of the boulder, far right if you're facing west.","protection":"pad","location":"about 50 feet west of the Bruce Lee Boulder"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,92f9a13d-6569-5e8a-bcf6-421cc787b8f4,2a973519-48be-50ae-acf3-c87f4d6a6162,df66fc7e-939c-55df-bcb0-5ca6b8fe2196,9d61addd-6d93-5ed7-9246-f007213b7de7,16975839-e66f-5d6d-9294-fad61ef3532f","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Southwest Cascades","Columbia Gorge","Hamilton Boulders","Lower (Main) Area","Date Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2+"},{"count":2,"label":"V2"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.03412,45.64311]},"bbox":[-122.03476317513805,45.64266033981815,-122.03347682486195,45.643559660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119081597","area_id":"FpdYOeZvXW2SlPrWHvNTLw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:39.696Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:34.960Z"}
