Unlike its  popular sibling [Ozone](https://openbeta.io/crag/079f2530-9cd1-5d5c-9b98-3088064aba5e), this crag doesn't see much visitors even during the height of the summer.  Just under one hour drive from downtown Portland and with a short approach from the car, it's an excellent crag for those whose want a quick getaway from the city and some solitude.  Most of the climbs are traditionally protected in the 5.8s - 5.10s range.  As of 2023, anchors are in great condition.\n\n### How to get there\n\nSee GPS coordinates. If heading east on Highway 14 (coming from Portland), the pullout is on the right side, approximately 0.5 mile after Ozone.  It's not unusual to drive pass Ozone pullouts full of cars just to find yourself alone at Farside.\n\nThe approach begins at the east end of the pull out.  It's not advisable to access the top of the crag from the approach trail."},"density":14.6,"totalClimbs":73,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:39.213Z","updatedAt":"2023-07-11T03:46:17.726Z","_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"64acd08955f9ec50d8708060","prevHistoryId":"64ac90be55f9ec50d870174b","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"updatedBy":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw=="}
