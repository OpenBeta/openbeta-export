Downclimbing the ridge of gendarmes is the crux. When you reach the lowest point in the ridge ascend either a series of ramps to the ledge under \"Horse's Mouth\" (shown in red) or a gully on the NE side of \"Point B\" (Shown in blue) to regain the ridge crest.

The scenery, position, and exposure on the climb are fantastic, but the rock quality is generally poor. I found the most difficult climbing to be the cleanest and easiest to protect but the nature of the route still requires as few as two placements in a 60m pitch.\n\nThe Shield Wall is only the first half of the route; 7 pitches of low 5th to 5.7. Once atop the wall you begin the process of navigating the parapets of the of the SE Ridge; three 30m rappels and an additional 6 pitches of climbing from 3rd to 5.7\n\nThe highlight of the route was the crux pitch passing the 2nd tower on the right by climbing a well protected finger crack, I thought this pitch was stout for the grade.\n\nRetreat from anywhere on the route would be complicated and potentially dangerous.\n\nDescend the standard route.","protection":"Single rack .0 - 3 and a set of wires.","location":"Use the trail located 1000ft beyond the standard route trail entrance."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,331c2ae8-e5e8-51da-b96b-01ef85a5ba36,ec50bde8-f454-5436-92bd-1a1b940140d8,9bc5ddfd-cea3-5182-866c-3903a29fb48f","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Olympics & Pacific Coast","Olympic National Park","Mt.
