At nearly 9000ft of elevation gain in 16 miles its one hell of a loop. Start by following the Lena Lake Trail to upper Lena lake. Its likely that after leaving Upper Lena you won't see anyone else for the rest of the day. From the lake head SW toward the ridge S of Mt Lena. If you play your cards right you'll catch the way trails that will guide you for most of the rest of the traverse. Continue heading west passing by scout lake and then up and over the ridge SE of mount stone. Continue skirting down and around the base of Mt Stone via the easiest route possible until you connect with the West Ridge. Ascend this ridge via a short 3rd class section. After bagging the summit decend and connect with the Putvin trail at the base. Follow the trail back down to Hamma Hamma river road where hopefully you have stashed bikes that will take you quickly down the last 4 miles of dirt road to your car.\n\nThis route makes for a very long day so make sure your up for it and bring appropriate gear. Ice axe and crampons are the only technical gear you'll need and you'll likely use them very little.","protection":"none","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,331c2ae8-e5e8-51da-b96b-01ef85a5ba36,ec50bde8-f454-5436-92bd-1a1b940140d8,bea662b8-ee62-5a46-9618-9f3e44d3f006","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Olympics & Pacific Coast","Olympic National Park","Mount Stone"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.5028,47.7319]},"bbox":[-123.50346853965591,47.73145033981815,-123.50213146034406,47.732349660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106150664","area_id":"vqZiuO5iWkaWGJ8+RNPwBg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:52.943Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:46.691Z"}
