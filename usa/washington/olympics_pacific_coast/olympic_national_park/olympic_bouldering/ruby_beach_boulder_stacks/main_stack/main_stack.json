Your hands will be bleeding after this route if you aren’t prepared. Mostly slopers other than a few key crimps and jugs. The rock is so grippy and coarse that it almost hurts to climb it. On the bright side your hands stick to the rock especially in the cold. Basically any surface feels like it’s grabbing you. You start with your feet on the overhung bottom, and your hands on a crimp and a slug (slopey jug) from there use the abundant amount of small jugs and slopes to get your way towards the top where you’ll meet some finger pockets. That’s what gives it a v1-2 grade marked by x’s 3 and 4 there’s a jug and dug in crimp. Then work your way up to a main finger pocket, get your feet on the jug, and drop your knee into a higher finger pocket of your choice.
