From here climb through a series of pockets, edges and nubs. The climbing goes from dead vertical to slabby at the top. With a great position above the water, the only thing spoiling this climb is the relatively short length and the coarse and often friable nature of the rock.","protection":"QDs","location":""},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:13.700Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:13.700Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,331c2ae8-e5e8-51da-b96b-01ef85a5ba36,873918a2-3795-5464-b060-58565d63ce7d,e4fcd589-631f-5a03-a778-e92d701b1eb3,0369efb5-ecbe-504a-8d09-f6c0bd15ff80","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Olympics & Pacific Coast","Elwha River","Underhood, The","Bermuda's Triangle"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-123.55563,48.0954]},"bbox":[-123.55630325252109,48.09495033981814,-123.55495674747891,48.095849660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111775258","area_id":"A2nvtey+UEqNCfbAvRX/gA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:08.545Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:55.612Z"}
