Climb the blocky, vertical face to a diagonal ledge angling up and to the right. At this point traverse left onto the slab face and climb until you reach a large ledge. There is a slightly tricky move to get off this ledge but from there you can scamble to the top.\n\nBe aware of rock quality, on my first ascent I had multiple holds break. Most of the bigger holds are solid (although I had a large jug pull at one point). On the slab be careful as a lot of the crimps aren't solid.
