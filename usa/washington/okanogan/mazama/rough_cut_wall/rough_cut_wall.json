There are anchors on top of the roof if just doing the first pitch. To access the second pitch, keep going another 30 feet. First up, then right to another anchor.\n\nPitch 2 follows the bolt line up through a weakness in the large roof high on the cliff. Just above the roof there's a single chain (presumably to make the clip easier), then two side by side bolts (odd). Clip the right one and climb the corner straight up.\n\nHeads up for some loose rock throughout, but especially towards the top. Helmet recommended. Regardless, this route has some really fun steep climbing!\n\nDescend in 2 rappels. There is a rap station just left of where you belayed atop P1. You have to swing in because of the overhang. If you have a 70m rope, you can use the rap station you passed near the end of P1. Knot your ends.","protection":"15 draws.
