Solid rock, ample protection, easy access, and a wonderful location add up to a classic and fun romp up this massive wall.\n\nAlthough there are 5.9 cruxes on this climb, they are all very short and very well-protected.  Overall, the route is extremely generous in its bolting.\n\nPitch 1:\n\nBegin at a small fir tree.  Head up easy 5th-class ledges to a large ledge with a bolted anchor next to a large fir.\n\n(5.4)\n\nPitch 2:\n\nSteep face to an anchor.\n\n(5.8)\n\nShift\n\nthe belay to below a left-facing dihedral.\n\nPitch 3:\n\nUp the dihedral. You will pass a rappel anchor.  Continue up to the anchor on the ledge with the large blocks.\n\n(5.7)\n\nPitch 4:\n\nClimb the face above through three steep cruxes. Juggy pockets just where you want them keep the grade moderate. End in the Notch.\n\n(5.9-)\n\nPitch 5:\n\nClimb the straight-forward face above. Belay at a tree.\n\n(5.7)\n\nShift\n\nthe belay to the large fir by the wall. The top of the gully is here. It is my understanding that you can descend the gully from here. It might be an unpleasant \"pinball\" experience down the scree. Beware loose rock from above.\n\nPitch 6:\n\nClimb a nicely exposed face with a slight left-to-right traverse.\n\n(5.8)\n\nPitch 7:\n\nThis pitch begins with a bouldery crux off the ledge. There are a couple more bouldery moves on this fun pitch.\n\n(5.9-)\n\nShift\n\nthe belay again to below the juggy slab. There is a large fir tree here showing scars from the frequent rockfall at this spot. Beware, especially if there are parties above you here.\n\nPitch 8:\n\nClimb the fun juggy slab to a semi-hanging anchor.\n\n(5.8)\n\nPitch 9:\n\nThis pitch follows a short, exposed traverse to the right.\n\n(5.4)\n\nPitch 10:\n\nTraverse back to the left. You will reach a 2-bolt anchor. It might be preferable to continue up to the beginning of the next pitch and belay off of the first bolt. If you opt to belay off of the 2-bolt anchor, be sure to shift your belay before starting Pitch 11.\n\n(Easy 5th-, 4th-, and 3rd class)\n\nPitch 11:\n\nThe money pitch. Begin by ascending a short leaning pillar. Stem over to the main wall, and thrutch up a somewhat awkward set of features. Beyond, the awkwardness eases, but the difficulty remains consistent.\n\n(5.9)","protection":"15 quickdraws.  A single 60-m rope.\n\nHelmets\n\n.

The trailhead is 100 m north of the parking.  Follow the trail up to the talus field.  Cross the talus to gain the trail up and back to the left.  The route begins at the foot of the buttress, just south of the cascading Goat Creek (on the south side of the next gully south of the creek, actually).\n\nA more detailed description of the approach and the route itself can be found in Bryan Burdo's guidebook, or by asking at the Goat's Beard climbing shop in Mazama.\n\nYou can rappel the route with a single rope.  Alternatively, you can park a car (or bike) shuttle on Goat Creek Road, and hike to the top and drive back down.\n\nIf opting for the car shuttle, drive up Goat Creek Road; turn left at the Y (hairpin).  Follow the road up past 2 (?) cattle guards.  At the second cattle guard, the road will begin descending.  Park here.  The trail should be on the left side of the road, just north of the barbed-wire fence.\n\nTo return to your vehicle from the top of Prime Rib, the key idea to keep in mind is that you are north of the barbed-wire fence, and there is a trail that runs all the way along the fence to the top of the wall.\n\nFrom the top of Pitch 11, continue up 2nd- and 3rd-class ledges until you reach the forest.  Continue uphill, aiming to stay on the ridge.  If in doubt, go right (south).  It is impossible to go too far right.  Eventually you will find the fence.  Follow it back to the road.
