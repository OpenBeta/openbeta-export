Move right through the first roof and enjoy the high-quality rock. Traverse left into the awkward start of the overhang (this is the crux). Continue climbing through overhanging bulges  and a stellar crack after the last roof to a 3 bolt anchor. The leader must belay the follower from above to clean and then both climbers rappel twice with a 60 meter rope. *** This route is long and strenuous. Use KNOTS at the end of your rope and mitigate rope drag with RUNNERS!!***\n\nOptional: This can be done as 2 pitches but recommended as one endurance burn.
