Good consistently fun climbing (except for the 50' long 4th class scramble up the middle section) leads to very nice rock up high. Belay at the 2 bolt anchor just below the top. A 60m rope just barely reaches (so use a couple of long draws above the middle rap anchors and have the second tied in and ready to climb from the start), an inexperienced team may want to do it in 2 pitches (belay at the rap station half way up).\n\nThere are a few ways to descend. Walk off to the east (easy gully with lots of loose rock) or two single 60m raps down the route via the rap anchors at the top of the 4th class section, then walk off down East gully or walk west and continue rapping down Mercy Street (on the Middle Earth Wall).","protection":"fixed - 17 bolts","location":"On the right end of the upper Ledge area, best approached by the scree slope at the far right end of Burge (right of the base of Raptor Wall).
