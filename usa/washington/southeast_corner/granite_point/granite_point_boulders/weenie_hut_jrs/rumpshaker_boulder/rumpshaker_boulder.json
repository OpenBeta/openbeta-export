Start with your right hand on a solid dimple sloper on the right side of the arete and left hand and a sharp side pull on the face, both holds about chest to head height off the ground. A heel hook at the start is quite helpful. Slap your right hand up on slopers until your ready to move on to the face of the boulder that is less overhung. Make a move to the horn and celebrate that the hard moves are over. Continue up with easy moves to the top of the boulder. The topout is fairly high off the deck but gives a beautiful view of the river and has an easy walk off using the arete of Feel Good.","protection":"","location":"The prominent awesome looking overhung rock you will see first in this area to the right of Dirty Upper lip."},"__v":0},{"_id":"um9NNIhPUwqKlQWSUnC9/w==","name":"Feel Good Arete","yds":"V-easy","grades":{"yds":"V-easy","font":"3","vscale":"V-easy"},"fa":"Mason Ulrich","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.36146,46.60094]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"119432006","mp_crag_id":"119436676","climb_id":"um9NNIhPUwqKlQWSUnC9/w==","areaRef":"FZ8s7/iKXnyDJO+3ReSWFw=="},"content":{"description":"Start as far left as possible on the arete located in the cave like area to the left of the rumpshaker.
