Start with left hand sidepul and right hand gaston right next to each other (feet can be placed on ramp below boulder but try to avoid climbing over to the boulder your feet start on. Move your left hand up to series of small crimps slighlty further than center of slabby face until you can get your right foot to left hand start (almost a handfoot match with right foot and right hand). From here find your way to standing on the slabby part of boulder having to arch your back if your taller since the portion above the slab is in your way to stand up straight.

Find whatever feet work for you and either shoot straight up to left arete or reach out right to crimpy pocket like feature. If you reach out right first work to the left arete and finally get in a spot where you have good feet to continue up arete and finish the route by topping out straight up from the end of the arete staying on the face you started the route on.
