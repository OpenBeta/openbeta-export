Traverse all the through the cave until you start to exit and then shoot up for the bird poop covered jugs. Once you reach the bird poop jugs shoot up again to the ledge above and work your way left until you can sit on the top of the boulder that lies above the cave. At some point I will get the courage to heel hook and rock over on top of the ledge for a cleaner topout that would have a horrendous fall if you were to slip (quite scary when alone to try that top out).","protection":"","location":"In the cave formed behind the Head Games boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ErPb6obdUzSD0mXnyT+0zw==","name":"Path of Least Resistance","yds":"V0-1","grades":{"yds":"V0-1","font":"4+","vscale":"V0-1"},"fa":"Mason Ulrich","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.36259,46.60142]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119433127","mp_crag_id":"119432790","climb_id":"ErPb6obdUzSD0mXnyT+0zw==","areaRef":"rQW/jK9RWKSkJHY0SXeW8g=="},"content":{"description":"Start with right hand on small ledge and base of the seem that runs up the face and left hand on the small slopey ledge above and left of right hand.

From here get footsy with it and work your feet up to move right hand to slopey ledge out right or use intermediate crimps to help get you there. Slap right to a higher slopey ledge with a hidden good spot that makes it feel less like a sloper. Cross or bump to get to a hold on the right side of the crack and continue straight up for topout.
