The original route heads up discontinuous cracks and ramps on the slab to the right, ending at a belay on top of the snag buttress.  Another option (better in my opinion) is to climb Undercover to the Springboard ledge on top of Zig Zag.\n\nPitch 3\n\nHead directly up from the Snag Buttress to a ledge below a roof.
