There is a large tree at the top of the wall to build an anchor. Route starts to the left of a tree right off the trail on sloping terrain that angles up and left. Climb nice rock up and left for 10 feet or so. Jugs and large sidepulls are plentiful for nearly the entire route until the top. A few tricky moves will get you to the top of a small ledge that is to the left of a bulge. Climb bulge directly if you want to get sporty but be prepared to clean off moss and dirt.","protection":"Large tree at top, bring slings and gear to create top rope.","location":"Wall is on left as you hike south next to Cranberry Lake."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,eb90c961-5437-5017-84ab-dc81bc063e94,e555294e-d0c0-5150-a0bb-fd8d44cc7889","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","San Juan, Fidalgo & Whidbey Islands","Cranberry Lake"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.64268,48.50262]},"bbox":[-122.64335864445955,48.50217033981815,-122.64200135554042,48.503069660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119665467","area_id":"5VUpTtDAUVCgu/2NRMx4iQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-122.64335864445955,48.50217033981815],[-122.64200135554042,48.50217033981815],[-122.64200135554042,48.503069660181865],[-122.64335864445955,48.503069660181865],[-122.64335864445955,48.50217033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:38.005Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:02.893Z"}
