I was REALLY bummed but the wall got cleaned and I was there so I took my consolation prize and it turns out it was pretty tasty.\n\nStart on top of the large pedestal/apron. With your left hand on the arete, get your feet on the slab and set off on your journey. I'll leave it at that besides these two bits of beta....1)At some point you want to get into a layback on the dihedral feature in the middle of the wall. 2) You will want, at the very minimum, basic crack climbing skills for the top.\n\nThis was almost called Tiger Crack Attack, Cougar Crack, or Lawn Dart to commemorate a pretty spectacular fall from Trip which resulted in what looked like a big cat attack to his leg.","protection":"I used 4 closed pads lying flat and 1 open pad on top. This setup took 2 falls from up high which resulted in nothing but laughter.","location":"If you walk uphill from Load Management and walk past the Aeolian and Timebomb boulders approxiamtely 50-ish feet you will find a tall and imposing arete.
