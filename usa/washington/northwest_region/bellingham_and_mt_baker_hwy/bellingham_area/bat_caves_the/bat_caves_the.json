There is some great climbing, it just happens to be guarded by choss and vegetation. Ah, the Northwest","protection":"Gear from .5 to 5 inches, doubles 1-4 (extra wide gear won't hurt)\n\np1(5.7): A chossy approach pitch angles up a vegetated slab/corner to a large block. Once on top of the block traverse left past a bolt to the base of the crack and up to a bolted anchor. Gear is non-existent off the deck, and the foliage adds some spice to the first 40 feet.\n\np2(5.10+): Wild stemming and jamming made on this steep splitter is made slightly more difficult by shrubs growing in the crack. Mostly #.75-3\n\nBuild an anchor from a stance on a chockstone, as the crack widens to 4\". (or run the hero pitch to the top)\n\np3(5.8): Follow the dirty 3-5\" crack to the upper tier and belay off a tree.\n\nScramble up to the top and walk off the hiking trail. Also, with a 70m rope, one can rappel from the top, to the anchor at the top of pitch one.","location":""},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:13.008Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:13.008Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,349d3bbe-0812-53d3-8cbb-004f7a46ff2c,e6c36c34-e7c3-57bf-aaed-1b549bfab786,b7eb0f16-6e3c-5b7a-888f-a0899d75c3c6","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","Bellingham and Mt Baker Hwy","Bellingham Area","Bat Caves, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.4159,48.6267]},"bbox":[-122.41658031145339,48.626250339818135,-122.41521968854659,48.627149660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107681560","area_id":"t+sPFm48W3qIj6CJnXXDxg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:07.528Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:53.871Z"}
