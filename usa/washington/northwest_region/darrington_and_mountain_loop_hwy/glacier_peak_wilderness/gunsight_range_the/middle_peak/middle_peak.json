The route will require carrying over, likely with ice axes and crampons. It begins and end on glaciers, although for us it began on the Chickamin and ended on the Blue Glacier. Most of the climbing is in the 5.9 range.","protection":"Double rack of cams from yellow Alien to gold camalot. Single #3, #4, single finger/tips cams, and a set of nuts.","location":"To find the start of where we began, just walk along the Chickamin Glacier to the north, well past the NE peak, and you almost get to where a dirty gulley of bad rock more or less ends the ridgeline's continuousÂ run. At this point you can tell that the top of the ridge will be a  pitch from the snow. We did a pitch that began off large squarish blocks, just to the right of this broken dike/gulley."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:13.001Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:13.001Z"},{"_id":"Zo8+OD3MVPOeSlcitnQF0Q==","name":"East Face","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Wertkin and Putelis - 2006","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.66,48.5093]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106325768","mp_crag_id":"106325754","areaRef":"pY13T6CyWii2DEdB/Iu0rQ=="},"content":{"description":"This route follows a hidden line, which unfolds piece by piece with amazing climbing and perfectly clean rock.
