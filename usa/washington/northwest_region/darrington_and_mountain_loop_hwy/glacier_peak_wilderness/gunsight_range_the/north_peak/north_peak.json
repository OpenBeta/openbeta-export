Climb up a pillar, cracks, flakes, and occasional knobs, generally straight up. A belay can be made at ~40m on a small (think one foot) stance.\n\nPitch 2 - The crux pitch. Follow thin cracks and knobs to the left of the large corner, overcome a small roof (5.11+) and belay in cracks above, at the base of an orange flake.\n\nPitch 3 - Up cracks on the right side of the flake, that gradually widen from 1/2\" to 3\" - 5.10\n\nPitch 4 - Up the obvious widening crack above, occasional face holds help when most needed. 5.10++. Belay will be at a small ledge, the first real stance encountered on the route.\n\nPitch 5 - Straight up the dark corner above, fun stemming and face holds lead to a mantle onto the summit terrace. 5.8\n\nThis is one of the best routes in the Cascades.","protection":"A full rack, including doubles of mid-sized cams and a 4-5\" Cam. Offset nuts and small cams are helpful, especially if aiding the crux roof.","location":"From the left (north) edge of the face, traverse right on a narrow ledge to a small cairn near where the ledge divides.
