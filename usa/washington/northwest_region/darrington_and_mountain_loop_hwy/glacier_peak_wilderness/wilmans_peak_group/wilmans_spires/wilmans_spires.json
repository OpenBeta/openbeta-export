Joining the crack is 5.6, the crack itself is 5.4. The crack leads to a ledge; from here, head a little east to the summit.\n\nDescent: two single-rope rappels (from a bolt on the summit and a slung station east of the first crack), then descend the ramp and climb back over the 5.5 crack to the notch.","protection":"Set of nuts and cams, maybe hexes (basically a light alpine rack), and plenty of slings for rope drag. 50m+ rope... it can be combined into two pitches with a 60 or 70, but the meandering nature of the route will cause more drag.\n\nIf in early season, bring ice axe and crampons, as the gully can get fairly steep.","location":""},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.435Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.435Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,3a23c2ca-4492-5f50-b79b-ecc5b445d938,d04fcbcf-7d1f-54e9-8c87-1ddd287a39ce,d57a4db6-fd8a-5e98-9c9d-94b4ee503a60,a9f559e2-5093-5650-b72e-6a39bce65f68","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","Darrington and Mountain Loop Hwy","Glacier Peak Wilderness","Wilmans Peak Group","Wilmans Spires"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.36585,47.97249]},"bbox":[-121.36652164851832,47.97204033981815,-121.36517835148165,47.972939660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120288527","area_id":"qfVZ4lCTVlC3Lmo5vOZfaA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:06.563Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:51.923Z"}
