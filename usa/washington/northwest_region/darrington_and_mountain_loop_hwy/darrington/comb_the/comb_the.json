Easily 4-star climbing, but docked a star for the scrappy start. The climbing is well protected by a mix of perfectly located 3/8\" bolts and gear. Pitch 1 angles right, past the 10a crux, then up a knobby face. Pitch 2 starts with more steep knob grappling (5.9 reach) then eases off, passing a couple gear placements. Pitch 3 attains the left-trending flake crack above (10b), then finishes with more knobs. Rappel the route using double 60s.","protection":"First pitch is all bolts, pitches two and three are mix of bolts and gear. Full route requires a standard rack, double on cams under 2\", plus a dozen draws.","location":"Approach using the strip of old growth, then follow the horizontal log as described under The Comb overview. Â From the end of the log, continue right another ~300' to the base of the route - see photos. Once you spot the bolts, reaching the start (3\" fir tree) requires ascending a steep vegetated ramp angling left."},"__v":0},{"_id":"1F0174eEXWySD7nJiar3eg==","name":"Bump City","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Don Brooks 1973","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.62054,48.15345]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119929917","mp_crag_id":"119913914","climb_id":"1F0174eEXWySD7nJiar3eg==","areaRef":"r8uagAWqUaGsXqyH5TqenA=="},"content":{"description":"An early Comb route with great knob and slab climbing and stainless hardware.
