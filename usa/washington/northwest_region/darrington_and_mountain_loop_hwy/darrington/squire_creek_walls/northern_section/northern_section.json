It took two seasons; back and forth, nobody there except us, the hummingbirds and the frogs.\n\nA couple years back we had thrashed our way over from the base of the Daddy and there it was, our new beginning. It starts in a kind of hollow grotto, a narrow swan's neck of granite, twisting its way down from way the hell up there, curving and white. Here we could start...\"","protection":"Single standard rack to 4\". There is a cruxy spot on the first pitch which protects well with a #5 Camalot, not needed higher up.\n\nAll of the holes on this route were drilled with hand drill and hammer. As the route is within the boundaries of designated Wilderness, power drills are not allowed. All bolts are 3/8\" stainless steel wedge bolts. Hangers are modern, stainless steel, mostly powder coated. Chain anchors are mostly Fixe stainless steel two-hanger chain with equalized ring.","location":"Follow the approach directions on the Northern Section page.
