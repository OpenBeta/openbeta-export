As a member of that first recorded ascent team, I can vouch that there was little sign of it being climbed before, except for a 20+ year-old chewed up and faded white rap sling at the top of pitch two. It also features an abundance of loose, lichen-y rock that will keep it from being \"classic\" unless it gets a lot of traffic. This is certainly an \"adventure climb\"!\n\nPitch 1 - 20m, 4th class. Gain the South Ridge from the snowfields, then traverse aproximately 70' down and right to the start. 20m - Climb straight up to gain the ridge line. DO NOT link with Pitch 2, as your belayers will be in the fall line of any P2 rockfall.\n\nPitch 2 - 30m, low 5th class. Climb the ridge! Pitch ends in a small notch below a gendarme. The historic rap sling (only sign of an earlier attempt) are on the overhanging horn. Scary to think of rappelling on the that!\n\nPitch 3 - 30m, 5.6. Bypass the gendarme on the right, keeping to the more difficult but also more solid rock. Regain the ridge and stop just short of the notch.\n\nPitch 4 - 30m, low 5th class. Continue up the ridge to the cockscomb belaying just short of the summit ridge.\n\nPitch 5 - 30m, low 5th class. Best broken into 2 or 3 quick short pitches to the summit.\n\nDescent: Descend the North Ridge.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Mr4v1NZEV1Cuy4YtAo01cQ==","name":"North Ridge","yds":"4th","grades":{"yds":"4th","french":"1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.06681,48.50663]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"109252305","mp_crag_id":"109252144","climb_id":"Mr4v1NZEV1Cuy4YtAo01cQ==","areaRef":"8QJ9Suz2VDWpru0iulpPrA=="},"content":{"description":"The North Ridge starts at the obvious col between the Aiguille and the Torment-Forbidden ridge. 2-3 pitches of almost-level ridge climbing can be pitched out, simul-climbed, or short-roped (3rd class).
