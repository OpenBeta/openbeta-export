Find a good spot to cross the moat and climb approx. 80m up low angle dirty 4th (no pro). Traverse left to an obvious couloir. Climb the couloir (50-60 degree snow or AI2, rock pro to right) and pull over the chockstone at the top. Make another short traverse left then ascend directly up the face on low-5th with occasional steeper steps no harder than 5.6. Keep an eye out for the \"duo-lith\", an obvious boulder split by an off-width. Climb past it, gaining the N. Ridge a couple of rope lengths beyond. The easy, scenic simul-climb along the ridge crest is over too quickly but the views from the summit are more than adequate compensation.","protection":"light alpine rack to 3\"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,728b06de-e8c1-5ee6-af71-bc29729507d1,bec8f6d2-89a9-5283-8aba-7e22fb2870b3,8369f825-5317-51e6-b41e-d77a14112eb5","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","Hwy 20 and North Cascades National Park","North Cascades","Mt.
