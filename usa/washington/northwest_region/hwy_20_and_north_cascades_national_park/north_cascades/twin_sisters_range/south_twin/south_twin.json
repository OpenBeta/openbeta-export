Many route options exist and the going is a steady class 3. One short class 4 down climb constitutes the crux of the route.\n\nAt the notch it should be obvious that continuing to follow the ridge crest will become class 4/low 5th, at this point traverse around to the south and follow gullies and/or a snowfield (seasonal) to the summit.\n\nIn general the rock is quite solid and the scrambling is among the best to be found in the Cascades. I believe this is considered one of the longest continuous scrambles in the range.","protection":"Some parties have reported bringing ropes and a light alpine rack, expect class 4 with some moderate exposure and plan accordingly.","location":"A rough climber's trail can be picked up around where a large pipe crosses the logging road, this can be followed to the aforementioned basin."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,728b06de-e8c1-5ee6-af71-bc29729507d1,bec8f6d2-89a9-5283-8aba-7e22fb2870b3,92a408b9-55d2-5853-aa80-116714a55b8a,ed04b8f8-e5b7-5416-b29f-fe3e681760fa","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","Hwy 20 and North Cascades National Park","North Cascades","Twin Sisters Range","South Twin"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.98725,48.70484]},"bbox":[-121.98793136710312,48.704390339818126,-121.9865686328969,48.70528966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111256587","area_id":"7QS4+OW3VBayn/4+aBdg+g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.98793136710312,48.704390339818126],[-121.9865686328969,48.704390339818126],[-121.9865686328969,48.70528966018185],[-121.98793136710312,48.70528966018185],[-121.98793136710312,48.704390339818126]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:48.997Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:17.815Z"}
