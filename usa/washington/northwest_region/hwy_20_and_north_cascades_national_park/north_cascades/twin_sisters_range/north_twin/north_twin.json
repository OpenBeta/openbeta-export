Once you've endured the slog, the route slowly turns from exposed hiking between stands of little fir trees into some sporting alpine scrambling. Options for 5th class abound. Easy route finding (just follow the ridge crest) with beautiful views and solid grippy rock! Lots of unnecessary handjams and fingerlocks can be had.\n\nExcellent write-up on\n\nSummit Post\n\n.","protection":"Most do it in a pair of sturdy hiking boots. If descending the north slope, bring ice and crampons.
