Class 2 on rubble gains the summit. One rappel and downclimbing gains the shoulder; walk back towards the start of the ridge to locate a small tree with rappel slings; one more rappel from a large block gets you to the ground.","protection":"Single rack to #2 camalot, long slings","location":"West side of North Ridge starts below the 5.7/5.8 more direct North Ridge."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,728b06de-e8c1-5ee6-af71-bc29729507d1,bec8f6d2-89a9-5283-8aba-7e22fb2870b3,63085d13-a2a7-5cea-bcea-bf0407ea8856,7b38be5f-a106-5060-a490-0963d36cef1e,08f75f45-5dc1-5184-b356-a06fdcf5adf7","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","Hwy 20 and North Cascades National Park","North Cascades","Washington Pass","Cutthroat Lake Crags","Molar Tooth"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.70807,48.5394]},"bbox":[-120.7087491374081,48.53895033981814,-120.7073908625919,48.539849660181886],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117649096","area_id":"CPdfRV3BUYSzVqBv3PWt9w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:49.548Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:45.535Z"}
