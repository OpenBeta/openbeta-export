From Burgandy Col, drop down the steep snow onto the glacier and head East.  Eventually, you will arrive at the rock that leads to the summit.  Scramble up and be proud.  To descend, reverse the route.","protection":"Most climbers will only need standard glacier gear, but some may want a light(!) rock rack for the scrambling to the summit.","location":"There are two starts to this climb:\n\nBurgundy Col\n\nThe most common approach begins at mile marker 166 on Highway 20.  Drop down the embankment and cross the creek on a log, then pick up the well-defined climber's trail.  From here, make the long hike towards Burgundy Col.  Eventually, you will see a gully that heads to the Col - stay on the left of the gully and haul yourself up there.  Once at Burgundy Col, grab some water and a snack while taking in the incredible views. This approach involves about 3500 feet of elevation gain to reach Burgundy Col, where you will downclimb steep snow to gain the glacier.\n\nSilver Star Creek\n\nI have not personally done this approach.  There is good beta available on Summitpost and other websites, but you essentially stay on the East side of the mountain the whole time and avoid the climb to Burgundy Col. This is the best option when it is early season and there is plenty of snow covering the approach."},"__v":0},{"_id":"8tYOG1IHV7a5egnJAGeVeQ==","name":"East Ridge","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"Geof Childs, Larry Goldie 9/14/2000","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.58637,48.54845]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"119482513","mp_crag_id":"111875731","climb_id":"8tYOG1IHV7a5egnJAGeVeQ==","areaRef":"PL0J1OYjXUqmypnYt7NEFw=="},"content":{"description":"This often overlooked but stunning ridge follows a continuous path from the Cedar Creek TH to the summit of Silverstar.\n\nGeof and Larry graded it 5.8 IV, soloing the entire ridge and skirting some of the sub summits. If you rope up earlier or keep a continuous path up the ridge it can easily become 5.9+ V or harder.\n\nI gave it an PG13 rating due to the loose rock encountered on route, and another parties agreement that it was quite dangerous. I would say PG13/R is fair depending on your chosen route.\n\nThe best beta I can provide is to try and follow the ridge as much as possible. Just follow your intuition and enjoy the flow.\n\nIf you think you need more specific beta, this is likely not the route for you.\n\nSome history for the route can be found in this NWMJ article\n\nPart 1\n\nand\n\nPart 2\n\nThe Wa Pass Traverse TR\n\nMy TR with photos for stoke","protection":"Standard rack.
