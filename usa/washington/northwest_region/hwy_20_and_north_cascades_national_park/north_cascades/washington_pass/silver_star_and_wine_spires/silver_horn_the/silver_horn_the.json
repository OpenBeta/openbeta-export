Up finger cracks through occasionally scrappy rock, then step left out of the main corner, into a smaller and cleaner corner. Atop the big corner, traverse right, below a roof, and into a beautiful splitter crack, flakes, and delicate mantle to top-out. A few shorts bits of 5.10a... mostly easier and well-protected.\n\nFrom the midway ledge, begin at the toe of center of the upper face. Aim for a roof just above  small pine, and below a long right-facing corner. Pull the roof (crux) and jam up the long hand crack to a belay. Move up and rightward to a nice ledge and belay stance. Pitch 7 begins with easy laybacking on junk rock before the quality improves markedly and stemming corner leads to a hard sequence exiting the corner, and a nice ledge. The final pitch follows the deep chimney (protect well once inside) up under the summit before swinging pullups and a mantle deposit you on top.","protection":"Cams and nuts to 3\"","location":"Beginning at the obvious flake on the left side of the lower wall, this climbs crosses over \"The Chalice\" at the obvious halfway ledge.\n\nWe descended via rappeling the SE side of the peak to the start of the face.
