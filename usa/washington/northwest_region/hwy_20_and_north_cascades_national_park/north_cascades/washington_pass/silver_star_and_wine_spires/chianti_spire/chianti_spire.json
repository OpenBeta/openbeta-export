There are at least two starts possible, before joining at P3.\n\nTraditional start:\n\nP1/P2 - Follow the large left-facing dihedral with orange rock on the right, and grey on the left. The crack is wide, but protects well. 5.8-5.9\n\nLeft Variation:\n\nP1 - Aim for the clean white left-facing corner  to the left of the long orange, traditional start. One long pitch gets you up into the perfect finger crack and to a small stance below a chimney. Save yellow alien sized cams for the last 20 feet. 5.10b\n\nP2 - A few well-protected chimney moves lead up to a horizontal break on the face above. Cut your feet loose and swing out wildly to the right, follow the crack up and right to join the original start in the major corner. 5.9\n\nP3 - Up The lower angle dihedral with face climbing and flakes. Belay before the route forces you to move left. 5.7\n\nP4 - Up the dihedral to a blind leftward step-across move. Keep working left to a ledge below a thin-hands splitter. 5.8\n\nP5 - Up the obvious crack, going from .75\" to 4\" to a small ledge and bolted belay. 5.10\n\nP6 - Continue up the 4\" crack, using face features and the corners, and eventually landing out on top next to the summit block.","protection":"Gear to 4\" with doubles from yello alien to #4 C4 camalot.\n\nIce axe will be handy for most of the year, all gear can be stashed at the base of the climb.","location":"From Burgundy Col, descend down a short snow step and traverse south below the East Face of Burgundy spire, over a small snowy rib, and to the obvious east side of Chianti.\n\nDescent is made via rappelling the route on fixed anchors. Two ropes are recommended, one might be possible.
