Great movement, committing moves, huge exposure, beautiful position: some of the best climbs in the Washington Pass area.\n\nP1: The West Face shares its first pitch with the Northwest Corner, a somewhat dirty face up to a chimney with trees above (5.8). From here, move the belay up 3rd class terrain to a huge sandy ledge at the base of a large corner, the base of the second pitch.\n\nP2: Climb this corner on the left side (5.8+) 50 feet to a good belay ledge. Continue up this corner (5.7), step left and and lieback up a 5\" flake (5.8) until you can stand and put in some pro. Continue past a horn with lots of slings around it and undercling right, past a bolt, below the small roof (5.9).\n\nP3 (or P4 if P2 broken up): The crux pitch (5.11-) begins at the end of the undercling, so get psyched. Climb the thin (!) crack up and a little left until it eases up and you can step left into the next crack system. Build a belay here (~40 feet up) or continue up another thin finger crack (5.10c) until it opens up to 2\" and eases off to 5.8. A few moves across the slab below a bolt bring you to an easier crack system. Finish up the cracks and then run across easy ground to the summit. Enjoy the views of North Early Winter Spire, Liberty Bell, and the Wine Spires!\n\nThe original descent is down and (skier's) left of the summit and descends into the notch between North and South Early Winter Spire. Three single rope raps bring you down to the notch (often snow-covered), another gets you off the large chockstone (a fun, free-hanging rappel), and some scrambling and downclimbing (or a short 30 foot rap) get you back on the ground.\n\nA newer descent starts about 15' climber's right of the end of the finishing jams.","protection":"Rock rack up to 3\".  The crux pitch and the 5.10 above it eat small stoppers like candy, but if 5.11 is near your leading limit, consider bringing a set of micro cams so that you can just plug and go.","location":"Look for the dirty cracks leading to a tree-topped chimney left of center as you approach the base of the tower."},"__v":0},{"_id":"GFgsJCUdUXWj0BssysWniQ==","name":"Northwest Corner (a.k.a.

There are some wide bits, but they are actually quite fun and don't require the use of wide crack techniques. The climb starts by scrambling up a trail traversing north along the base of North Early Winter to the base of a corner/crack that leads up to a ledge with lots of trees.\n\nP1 - Climb the crack/corner to the ledge. Part of it is a chimney that doesn't have much in terms of protection, but this section is short and fairly easy.\n\nP2 - From the left edge of the ledge, continue up and left through some more trees and up a corner to another belay ledge.\n\nP3 - Continue up a left-leading flake/wide crack (remember the big gear!!!) to another belay ledge with many slings wrapped around the tip of a small pillar. You don't want to skip this belay because you will want to have all your big gear for the next pitch.\n\nP4 - Continue up the \"surprisingly secure offwidth\" pitch. It seems like the best way to do this pitch is to smear up the face and stick your right arm in the crack for balance.
