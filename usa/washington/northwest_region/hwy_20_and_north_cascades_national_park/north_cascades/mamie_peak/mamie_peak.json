See topo for pitch details.\n\nThe route is easily and quickly rapped with a single 70m rope. On the big ledge find the rappel anchor about 30' to climbers left of the top of Pitch 3.  The sixth pitch has a tendency to eat ropes while rappelling.  To avoid this place a leaver biner on the second bolt and have the last person down clip the pull strand through the biner.
