Head up the ridge via moderate snow bypassing a pinnacle on right.\n\nJunky towers and bergschrunds ahead - bypass them left/east via low-moderate angle ramps within the icefall. Choose whichever is least interrupted by crevasses.\n\nRegain the ridge prior to Cockscomb. This section has insanely loose and sketchy rock in the wrong season. Pass Cockscomb on left via steep snow. Later in the season, one may have to descend to the Park Glacier and climb the headwall (AI3, several screws).\n\nFollow the snow/glacier ridge up to the summit.\n\nDescend Coleman-Deming (easy-moderate glacier).","protection":"Few screws and pickets. Glacier gear.","location":"This is the true north ridge of Baker whereas the classic North Ridge is actually the NW spur. Access from Heliotrope by crossing the Coleman and Roosevelt glaciers and taking low to moderate snow to the ridge around 7500 ft elevation.
