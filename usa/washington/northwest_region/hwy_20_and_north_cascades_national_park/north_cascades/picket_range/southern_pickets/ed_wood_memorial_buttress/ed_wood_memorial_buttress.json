Continue up a steep dihedral good rock to the summit of \"The Blob\".\n\nAs with many climbs of this alpine variety, the rating may vary according to the line one chooses.\n\nWe rated it 5.10c, but it was repeated and down-rated to 5.9. Hence the 5.9+ rating, as a compromise.","protection":"Gear to 3\", no fixed anchors.\n\nDescend by traversing the Blob ridge north to the Blob/Terror Col (an adventure in itself - short simul'ing is recommended). Look for webbing anchors over a steep section at the col edge, and rappel from there into the notch. An easy scramble down the col leads back to the bench, and maybe a rinse in a pool.","location":"Just North of the Himmelhorn on \"the Blob\" formation."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,728b06de-e8c1-5ee6-af71-bc29729507d1,bec8f6d2-89a9-5283-8aba-7e22fb2870b3,b8297bb5-4c54-58e3-afdb-312137b3faa5,92c1b7e2-484a-5cb8-83ec-d4bc7096a2fb,f168c140-6ad0-5a01-a3fd-505baa4d572f","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","Hwy 20 and North Cascades National Park","North Cascades","Picket Range","Southern Pickets","Ed Wood Memorial Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.28356,48.7716]},"bbox":[-121.28424227261745,48.77115033981814,-121.28287772738254,48.77204966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116791466","area_id":"8WjBQGrQWgGj/VBbqk1XLw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:49.555Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:42.773Z"}
