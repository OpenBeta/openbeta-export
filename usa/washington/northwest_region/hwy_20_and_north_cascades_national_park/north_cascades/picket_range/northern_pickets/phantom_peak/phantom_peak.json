A lot of snow climbing from the cirque, then a few leads of class 4 rock to the summit. The crux of the route is the hanging glacier below the peak, which may be impassable in late season. Make sure it is in condition. Ascend up the glacier just to the south of Phantom; continue up it Â where it narrows and flows from higher up on the peak. Turn north and climb over a rock step to the highest snowfield. Climb this to the notch, where the rock climbing begins. Two or three pitches of easy slab climbing lead to the ridge; avoid towers on the south and climb the 25-foot summit block. Rappel when possible and downclimb the route to the snow. Grade II from high camp in Luna Cirque.","protection":"Runners and a few pieces of gear, helmets, rope.","location":"On the east side of the Northern Pickets, from Luna Cirque."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,654ed03a-bd15-5545-b25f-4474e027735d,728b06de-e8c1-5ee6-af71-bc29729507d1,bec8f6d2-89a9-5283-8aba-7e22fb2870b3,b8297bb5-4c54-58e3-afdb-312137b3faa5,ad67a032-81d7-5e6a-ab4f-616465713ede,bac5c682-3080-5618-b8a7-3fe5caa26a93","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northwest Region","Hwy 20 and North Cascades National Park","North Cascades","Picket Range","Northern Pickets","Phantom Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.32977,48.8153]},"bbox":[-121.33045286715931,48.81485033981815,-121.32908713284066,48.815749660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119741589","area_id":"usXGgjCAVhi4pz/lyqJqkw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:49.552Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:24:45.829Z"}
