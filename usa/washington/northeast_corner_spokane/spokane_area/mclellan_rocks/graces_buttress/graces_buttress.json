One over the shoulder sling is a good idea at the start to keep rope drag to a minimum. A small selection of small cams is a good idea to protect the start until one has exited the overhang on its right side. After that the crack takes excellent solid cams all the way up. The large tree (long slings needed if used) or the obvious cracks at the top can be used at top rope anchors if a climber does not feel up to leading it but wants to practice his/her crack climbing skills.  Likely this route will settle more in the 5.9 difficulty range once it has been climbed a few times and cleans up a bit.  Like any first ascent there was a bit of lichen here and there, but the crack itself is now reasonably clean as are the key face holds.","location":"This route is hard to miss once one has located Grace's Buttress (also hard to miss).  It starts in a right facing dihedral capped by an overhang on the left side (river side) of the buttress.  The upper 2/3rds of the route is an obvious hand to off-fist slightly overhanging crack--easy to see."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:02.827Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:02.827Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,91c13448-e430-59b4-a625-bbc20c04d5bd,499c68c4-277c-5703-af05-7f254fb0751e,c42e435a-32e7-59d9-b696-7c95e99a699a,0ef90e59-2a0d-5118-b83b-882c098f8fd0","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Northeast Corner & Spokane","Spokane Area","McLellan Rocks","Grace's Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.72573,47.83596]},"bbox":[-117.72639987931295,47.835510339818136,-117.72506012068703,47.836409660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119516180","area_id":"DvkOWSoNURi4O4gsCY+P0A=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:59.839Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:38.961Z"}
