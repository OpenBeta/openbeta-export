Follow a few bolts up the easy face to the highest anchor.  Somewhat runout.  5.7, 20m.\n\nIt is possible to combine P1&P2.  Make judicious use of long runners near the P1 belay and also for bolts 3&4 on P1 to keep rope drag reasonable.\n\nIt is difficult to communicate with your second from the top of P2, and if the second falls low in the crux it can be quite challenging to get back on the route.","protection":"P1 6 bolts, P2 8 bolts, P3 6 bolts.

If you're sure no one is on I Wanna Go Home, rappel climber's left from the P3 anchor to the P2 anchor on that climb, and make another 35m rap to the ground. If not, rappel to the P2 Plank anchor and then rappel straight down Seize the Day, off the edge.\n\nYou can reach the ground in a full 60m (double rope) rappel from the top anchors.","location":"The rightmost line at Lost Boys, beginning in a corner."},"__v":0},{"_id":"NV8XtwHHU02AostU1eb+Eg==","name":"Lost My Marbles","yds":"5.10b/c","grades":{"yds":"5.10b/c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Garth Bruce, Drew Fletcher & Dave Perkins (2005)","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.6319,47.4352]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"105858455","mp_crag_id":"105853947","climb_id":"NV8XtwHHU02AostU1eb+Eg==","areaRef":"BRwOQqrdUlq0aZV+MOMA2Q=="},"content":{"description":"This is a nice line with good movement.

This felt more exposed than I expected from the ground; make use of the arete and think things through-- a short but unprotected fall on the anchor/ledge is a possibility.
