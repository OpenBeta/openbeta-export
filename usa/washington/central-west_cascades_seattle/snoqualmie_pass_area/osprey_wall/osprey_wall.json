There are a variety of rock types and some excellent crystal pocket holds. The pro is a mix of bolts and natural gear with the 3rd pitch being the only fully bolted pitch.\n\nPitch 1, “First Flight,” 5.6\n\nThe first pitch is a bolted slab that ends in a chute between two groves of trees. From the ground, spot the first bolt on the cleanest black and white granite. Scramble up dirty ledges to start the pitch. Exit this pitch to the right, then move the belay uphill and left beneath the corner.\n\n4 bolts, 30m\n\nPitch 2, 5.9+\n\nStart at the brown right facing corner with jagged rock. Stem your way up to a roof. After the roof move right to a short bolted slab. This takes you to the anchors beneath a clean, left facing corner. Some airy moves but the crux is well bolted.\n\n5 bolts + gear, 40m\n\nPitch 3, 10c\n\nThe money pitch! Thoughtful, steep moves through roof systems on awesome white marbled rock. A direct line to the heavens with two overhangs and a full value arête.\n\nStart on incut holds off the belay. Follow the steep corner and pass a roof, briefly moving right for a moment, then back left to follow the bolt line. At the final arête, follow the sustained face to the left or do some bigger dynamic moves out right.\n\n11 bolts, 30m\n\nPitch 4, 10c PG13\n\nAn adventurous and long pitch. Limited gear options, search carefully! If you are unsure about route finding look for distant bolts.\n\nMove horizontally off the belay to the right, placing small gear. At the huge exposed fins, move straight up to a four inch thick slung horn. Move up pockets and sidepulls to a stance with a small flaring horizontal. Follow bolts up a rightward diagonal ramp until at the final overhang. Protect your follower with a #1 at the end of the overhang, then continue up and right to a bolted belay at the top of the wall. Watch rope drag.\n\n55m, 5 bolts + gear, 9 long slings\n\nAt the final belay, look climber’s left for a tree rap anchor.","protection":"Doubles from Blue Alien to BD #1. A couple finger sized offset cams or Totems. Single #2. Small nuts, regular and offset.\n\n13 quickdraws, many long slings for the last pitch.\n\nTwo ropes for rappelling.","location":"From the small parking area, walk through the woods following cairns and trees flagged with climbing rope to the base of P1."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,6b052fb6-8d97-5eaf-a3ab-da30b42975aa,da501364-9f09-500a-85a9-5d3a042315b8","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Snoqualmie Pass Area","Osprey Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.42322,47.43549]},"bbox":[-121.42388476487383,47.43504033981814,-121.42255523512621,47.435939660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118562070","area_id":"2lATZJ8JUAqFqV06BCMVuA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:47.850Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:40.961Z"}
