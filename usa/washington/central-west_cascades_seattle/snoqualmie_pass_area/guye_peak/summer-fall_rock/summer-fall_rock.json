This climbs the obvious slightly treed south rib that faces the highway. The beginning is a pitch or two of fourth class (reasonably well protected), which soon gives way to dirt/tree/talus gullies on the upper rib separated by 3rd class rock steps (easily simulclimbed).\n\nP1 (4th): Climb the wide rock face, decent quality rock with best pro in a corner/dihedral in the center. You'll pop out on a large slabby, dirty portion with very little gear so best to belay at the edge of the steeper section, or just begin simuling.\n\nP2-4: Move to the right on the slab and climb a slightly steeper section with a few gear placements, then around to the right of a buttress and into a gully that sits above a larger gully. Beware rockfall. Finish at the top of the gully in a occasionally wet dihedral/chimney. Easily simuled, but exposure may lead to pitching out.\n\nP5-7: Move up and right from the top of the mini chimney through trees to the center of the ridge. (From here walk up and around right to the easiest gully). Four or five 70-foot steps follow, involving sections of 3rd and 4th class rock intermixed with dirt gullies and trees. It gradually grows easier until you reach the south summit block. Would require short pitches if belaying due to rope drag, so best simuled. (Exposure is limited.)","protection":"A single rack should do it, mostly cams. Pro on Guye is generally intermittent and bad (rock quality/flakes) so bring lots of slings to extend. The best belay cracks are not easy to find but are .75 to 2s. Bigger cams will get used as well. Generally smaller cracks are filled with dirt, flaring, and chossy.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"24ezYe8UU/OceWGQPq1wOA==","name":"South Gully/South Spur","yds":"Easy 5th","grades":{"yds":"Easy 5th","french":"1+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.40882,47.44195]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"111722458","mp_crag_id":"118580912","climb_id":"24ezYe8UU/OceWGQPq1wOA==","areaRef":"Xvx46PlwVNmsJyp2i6feiw=="},"content":{"description":"This is the summer/fall version of this route.  The winter/spring version is listed here:\n\nGuye Peak South Gully (winter/spring)\n\nAscends the obvious gully on the South side of Guye Peak.

With the exception of the traverse pitch, the rock is generally poor in quality and can be very lose.\n\nApproach: Start by hiking up the talus cone beneath the face and scramble a couple hundred feet of loose, mossy, dirty slabs to the the start of the roped climbing.\n\nPitch 1: wander up 100 feet of low 4th/low 5th class, occasionally crumbly and dirty rock to a tree, belay at the tree.\n\nPitch 2: continue for another 100 feet to a slung block belay, again low to mid 5th.\n\nPitch 3: continue up similar terrain to a large ledge, known as \"Lunch Ledge\". A second option is to climb some steeper and more difficult, but probably more fun cracks to the right, to a smaller sloping ledge at the start of the traverse pitch.\n\nPitch 4/5: The rock quality improves significantly here. If you start the traverse from the Lunch Ledge, you should climb a short pitch (~50 ft) right and up to the small alcove at the top of the cracks in the option for P3. If you start at that alcove, one pitch will suffice for the \"Improbable Traverse.\" Climb 5.8 moves straight out to the right, being careful not to go too high following an off-route piton. There should be good ledges for the feet and several old fixed pitons for protection. Make sure to protect the traverse for your follower as well.\n\nAt the end of the traverse climb down slightly to the base of the 4th class ramp that visibly cuts across the face from the highway.\n\nPitch 6/7: Climb 4th class up the ramp to the top of the ramp. Here the primary difficulties cease and a route to the summit can be found that avoids 5th class terrain.\n\nDescent: From the summit traverse north up and over two subsummits. Traversing over the final summit looks to be 5.9+ with significant exposure and poor rock/protection, so most rap off a tree on the east side and climb a short gully to bypass the true summit.","protection":"A standard medium sized alpine rack will suffice. There is some fixed pro on the traverse pitch.","location":"The route is located on the west face of Guye Peak.
