BABNH is not like that. It’s the kind of route a person could be standing in front of while exclaiming “Nothing worth climbing around here.”  A more insightful person might say “Hey here’s a cool crack” Full disclosure: I was not insightful and was in fact a little disappointed when I first saw the crack. Climbing it turned out to be a blast.\n\nPerhaps it’s really an extended boulder problem - albeit an easy one.\n\nThe route is a right arching thin crack and the climbing is much better than you'd first think; however, it is reluctant to dry out at times.  If you're working through the Exit 47 top rope circuit, it's definitely worth climbing as it's easily accessed and has kinda groovy climbing.","protection":"Tree for anchor on top?","location":"This route is located on a small formation directly uphill from Anne W/ An E."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.325Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.325Z"},{"_id":"KwhZ++ZVXA21vcp1SlQMBw==","name":"Anne with an E","yds":"5.11d","grades":{"yds":"5.11d","french":"7a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.46026,47.40014]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"117318615","mp_crag_id":"112012451","areaRef":"IziEK9lfUMK3+G3gkgwG1g=="},"content":{"description":"Splitter thin crack in despearate need of a cleaning","protection":"Finger sized pro","location":"Directly center of Anne with an E buttress"},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.325Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.325Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,6b052fb6-8d97-5eaf-a3ab-da30b42975aa,6f6cf23d-958e-58c8-8390-cbd286ebff06,2338842b-d95f-50c2-b7f8-6de0920c06d6","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Snoqualmie Pass Area","Exit 47","Anne with an E"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.46026,47.40014]},"bbox":[-121.46092431871844,47.399690339818136,-121.45959568128158,47.400589660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112012451","area_id":"IziEK9lfUMK3+G3gkgwG1g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:06.560Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:51.769Z"}
