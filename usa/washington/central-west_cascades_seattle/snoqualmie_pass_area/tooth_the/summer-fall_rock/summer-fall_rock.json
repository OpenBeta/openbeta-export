Great, well-bolted climb on a classic climbing objective in a beautiful location. Views of Mt. Rainier on the way up and tops out to views of Glacier, Baker, Stuart, etc. 60 m rope and some draws are all you need.\n\nAscent:\n\nP1: Scramble up to start climbing inside the corner and move left for face climbing with good hands. 6 bolts\n\nP2: Fun face climbing with great holds. Shift left onto the top of the face. Follow a series of ledges along the top of the face eastward to the next belay. You may not be able to see the bolts until gaining each ledge. 13 bolts\n\nP3: Follow the bolts line up and left to the next belay. Easy, but slightly licheny 5.7 climbing. Hanger on the 2nd bolt is missing as of 6-18-2020. 4/5 bolts.\n\nP4: Follow the bolt line up to a small face. Traverse slightly right then up to the belay. 7 bolts\n\nP5: The crux. Look left for a bolt to gain the ledge (watch out for a loose handhold) and traverse right along the top of it. Do some awkward moves up through an opening. Then move up to do some pumpy moves to get to the belay. Extend some of the draws to minimize rope drag. 9 bolts\n\nP6: Follow the bolt line for some easy climbing to the next belay. 5 bolts\n\nP7: Easy scrambling. Look right to a left facing dihedral/block for the single bolt. Follow that until the summit. There may or may not be an anchor at the top (couldn't find one). Depending on comfort could sling a block, put in some small cams (0.4 and 0.5 C4s), or some nuts to build an anchor on top. 1 bolt.\n\nDescent:\n\nDown climb to the top of P6 and do 6 single-length rappels down to the base of the climb.\n\nBe careful throwing rocks down if there are parties below.\n\nSome TRs on\n\ncascadeclimbers.com/forum/tâ€¦","protection":"13 draws.
