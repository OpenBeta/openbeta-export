Rock quality is poor in a lot of areas, be ready for run out ridge climbing. My lengths are rough estimates. We climbed with a 70m rope.\n\nP1: Start up the gully to the left of the saddle with trees. I made it to the ridge and went over it to belay off trees on the south side of the ridge. (200ft)\n\nP2: From the trees scramble down and skiers left until below a chimney-ish feature with a chockstone at its top. You won't see the chockstone from the trees, but it will be very obvious to spot from below once you scramble over. Climb up to below the chockstone. Supposedly there is another variation that acends the ridge itself here and ends above the chockstone. (90ft)\n\nP3: Go around and then over the chockstone to start climbing the ridge itself. There is a hard to protect move along the way up a small vertical face, with poor quality rock. Keep going until you reach a flat spot with trees on the right. I went left here to belay and be ready for the next pitch (200ft)\n\nP4 Continue left and regain the ridge. We started simuling here. I crossed back over the ridge to the south side and spotted what looked like a nice steep section of better quality rock so I went for it, but it turned out to just be steep with poor quality rock. If this part got cleaned up it would be fun. Until then, I don't recommend it. It prob went at 5.9-ish. I think you are supposed to stay on the ridge instead of what I did. (150ft)\n\nP5-6 Continue from the false summit to the real one (300ft)\n\nDescend by heading south for a short distance down to the little trails looking things, then head east to another '\"false summit\". On the far side of that false summit you see a tree with rap tat on it. This will be the second gully you come across on the descent (you will pass another gully as you are heading east toward the false summit). Rap or downclimb this gully until you see an obvious saddle going back toward the east. We saw rap rings high on the wall here, but everything was set for snow conditions, so we had to head down this gully a bit to get to some rap tat. Do a couple raps (depending on how much you want to downclimb), and end up on the skiers right of the east face. Go down the scree back to thumbtack rock.","protection":"Single Alpine Rack. I seemed to use my 0.4 a bunch, so maybe 2 of those.","location":"Approach as for East face, but when you get to thumbtack rock (10T 0616013E 5257415N), head right up a grassy gully to go over the ridge.

Depending on exactly where you start, this pitch is 5.1-5.6.\n\nPitch 2: Traverse left under the roof to climb easy 4th class rock for about 40m. There is very little pro here, so when you see a spot for a gear anchor, use it, as they are hard to come by.\n\nPitch 3+: Keep going up easy 4th class terrain trending slighty right towards a notch that puts you onto the Northeast Buttress, about 40m. You can either build another anchor at the notch or start simulclimbing. From here you are mostly in 3rd class terrain with perhaps a few 4th class moves up the left side of the Northeast face towards some trees.\n\nAfter topping out near the trees, you can scramble up to the summit of Chair Peak where there is a nice spot to sit and eat lunch.","protection":"Opportunities for protection on the route are minimal with some sections having over 50ft of runout. Finding good cracks for building gear anchors can take time.\n\nRecommended gear includes a set of small nuts, and single cams from .2 to 2\". There is one place for a #3, but it's not really needed. Bring plenty of single and double length slings as the route tends to wander, along with cordelette for building gear anchors.\n\nFor the descent, make sure you have some extra nylon webbing and rap rings for rappeling.\n\nDepending on the time of year, an ice axe will be *extremely* helpful.","location":"Approach:\n\nFrom the Alpental Ski Area parking lot, take the Snow Lake trail.\n\nAt around 1.5 miles, where the trail forks, take a left (West) towards Source Lake.\n\nFollow this trail for about a half mile until you see a somewhat narrow rocky gully heading WNW and starting at about 4200'. Depending on the time of year, this gully may have some snow in it with water running down.\n\nAscend the gully (3rd class) while trying to avoid slipping on the wet rocks or dislodging any big boulders until you reach a small cliff at about 4800'.\n\nFollow a path to the right heading North through a notch in the trees which opens up onto the basin directly below the east face.\n\nAscend the likely snow-covered basin, heading WNW, to the base of the climb at around 5500 feet, which begins right below a small narrow chimney that is easily identified from a distance.\n\nDescent:\n\nThere are many descent options, of which only one will be covered here.\n\nFrom the summit, head part way back the way you came until you see a *south facing* rock gully. There is a tree at the top of the gully with some webbing around it. If you don't see this tree, you are in the wrong gully. Either rappel or down climb the gully, which is filled with loose 3rd class rock until you reach a wider, steeper, looser gully that heads Southwest. Instead of continuing down, which looks quite treacherous, cross over the easy gully and scramble up to some trees and a notch.\n\nIf you are in the right place (good luck!) you will see a large boulder next to a tree with a bunch of webbing around it that is at the top of a steep, east facing gully. From here, do 3+ rappels (the number depends on how much snow is in the gully) to get back to the snowy basin where you started the climb. This will put you about 300 feet southwest of where you started.\n\nDescend the approach route, *or* head east over the snow and through some trees towards a large clearing until you reach a boulder field. Follow the boulder field down until you run into a trail that connects the Snow Lake and Source Lake trails. This is a bit longer, but also a bit easier than down climbing loose wet rock."},"__v":0},{"_id":"LS4R73r8VACCMmt3OI7jrw==","name":"Chair-Bryant Traverse","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"Ari Schneider, Jason Linker","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.46702,47.4596]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"116134757","mp_crag_id":"118647194","climb_id":"LS4R73r8VACCMmt3OI7jrw==","areaRef":"u+4y0WXFUQiQ4+rq6wtamA=="},"content":{"description":"Long alpine ridge traverse from Chair Peak to Bryant Peak. Summit to summit is 0.65 miles as the crow flies, but the actual climbing is obviously much longer. There are numerous sub-peaks along the way. Most of the climbing is easy 5th with some crux moves up to 5.7. There is a lot of rappelling required, thus the A0 rating.\n\nWe started up the Northeast Ridge of Chair (a popular ice route in winter). We free-soloed about 3/4 of the ridge (easy 5th), then roped up for a crux 5.6 move about 3/4 of the way up.\n\nWe then rappelled down a gully on the Southwest side of Chair, then continued free soloing up chossy rock up to the ridge proper. The ridge is then followed for about 0.35 miles (as the crow flies) over loose terrain with a number of mandatory rappels, some easy down climbing and blocky scrambling. We encountered a short slabby crux with a 5.7 finger crack that we protected with micro nuts.\n\nWhen we ran out of exposed ridgeline we rappelled down to the Bryant Peak col above Melakwa Lake. A short hike and some snow scrambing (ice axe appreciated) led us to some easy 5th class simul-climbing up the Northwest face of Bryant Peak. A few rappels off trees on the Northeast side of Bryant Peak brought us down to the snowfields above Source Lake.\n\nHiking out can be a slog. The goal is to intersect with the approach route for the Tooth.","protection":"Single rack of trad gear. Bring lots of extra webbing to assist with rappels. Pick a webbing color that will blend in with the rock. There are generally lots of big rocks and trees to rappel from, but we did need to pound two knifeblade pitons at one point to build a rappel anchor. 60m half ropes were very helpful for all the rappels. I personally would not try this with a single rope.","location":"Start at the Northeast Ridge of Chair Peak. Park at the Alpental Ski Area. Approach as for the Tooth. At Source Lake climb up a gully toward the Northwest, orienting to the Northeast Ridge of Chair Peak. I remember doing a short 4th class scramble to surmount a cliffband about halfway between Source and Chair.
