The snoqualmie rock book does an exceptional job at explaining the climbs. However if you do not have the book, there is a rest area with trees about 30 feet back of the wall, this spot is the best shade for this cliff the climb starts straight above these trees. Another way to find this climb is, you look up and there are tiers of ledges. Two climbs start about 20 feet up on the ledge where a belayer can stand there is a big black block one of the climbs goes up this route is Pillar Under Pale Streaks the other route on this ledge is Nocturnal Pulse of Celestrial Palace a 11d the first route to the left of these is With Love Lie Ancients Nestled Within.
