Well that's a flat lie. Whoever wrote that is a liar. This route is way better. If Ondra, Sharma and Honnold got together and devised a route to bring all their celebrity climbing friends to, this would be it. Prepare to climb better and get stronger by just looking up at this route from the belay. I've heard that by climbing this route, afterwards, you will be able to climb at least 1 grade harder. That's a number grade, not a letter grade. Put that in your pantry with your cupcakes.\n\nStart left of the bolt line and then go directly over the little nose off the deck...straddling the front of it with a cheval-like move. This will make the clipping and rope travel make sense. It will also make your crotch feel like it's in mortal danger. If the rope is wack, your beta is smack.","protection":"12 bolts, chains at top","location":"Directly to the right of 'Drilling Me Softly'"},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.325Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.325Z"},{"_id":"RdVKwOYoX6ygH+XLUYx6tg==","name":"Drilling Me Softly","yds":"5.10b/c","grades":{"yds":"5.10b/c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Wylie Moreshead, 2020","type":{"trad":false,"sport":true,"bouldering":false,"alpine":true,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.45564,47.36741]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"120477565","mp_crag_id":"120477509","areaRef":"45r5R5LZWmq72y2sXQnwgQ=="},"content":{"description":"OMG. Probably the best route you'll ever climb. It's got everything: 3D stemming, backstepping, flagging, roofs, laybacks, jugs, crimps, underclings, you name it. If you bring a date and they watch you climb this, they will insist on making wild passionate love to you when you get down. Just sayin' so you're not surprised. I contacted Mountain Project and asked them if they could make an exception and rate this route 6 stars. They refused because they are haters.","protection":"12 bolts, Chains at top","location":"Furthest left route on the Sofa King Buttress"},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.326Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.326Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,6b052fb6-8d97-5eaf-a3ab-da30b42975aa,6685e0d6-315d-56a9-ab7d-5536a02c5004,e39af947-92d9-5a6a-bbdb-2dac5d09f081","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Snoqualmie Pass Area","Citidel, The","Sofa King Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.10b/c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.45564,47.36741]},"bbox":[-121.4563039063891,47.36696033981815,-121.45497609361092,47.36785966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120477509","area_id":"45r5R5LZWmq72y2sXQnwgQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:06.559Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:51.739Z"}
