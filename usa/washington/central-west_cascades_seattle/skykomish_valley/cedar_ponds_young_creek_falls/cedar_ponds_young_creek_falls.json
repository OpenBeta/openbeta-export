The climb is on the hanging side, Once at the base of the climb you will be 15 to 20ft above a dark deep pool. Climb straight up on slopers and crimps to the base of a roof. Undercling and power out on slopers and pockets! I did this climb three years ago and never published due to laziness. This past year Aaron Day re-found the climb and re cleaned the poorly cleaned topout and got the 2nd ascent! Thanks for the cleaning and great work on send!!! The rock quality is 1* the movement 3* and the position is 4*. So overall i think 3* is fair. Also have people with you ready to pull you out if you botch the landing. DO NOT CLIMB ALONE!!!. You can also sess the topout on rappel. For the full send you got to jump off top! . Classic!","protection":"Deep Water solo","location":"Youngs Creek Falls.
