The Online Sector of Static Point has been rebolted, and at the FA team request, Online has been retro-bolted to invite more climbs. Don't worry, there is still plenty of runout - while the 33m 5th pitch is protected by 7 bolts, earlier pitches are up to 48m and only offer a handful of protection points, a mix of bolts and a few gear placements.\n\nFull information including topos can be found here:\n\nLINK\n\n.","protection":"There are 2-7 bolts per pitch with bolted anchors.\n\nA single set of cams #0.3-#2 or 3 and a single set of stoppers #4-10 should cover most gear opportunities on any route in this Sector.\n\nA full topo is available at the link in the Description.","location":"Online is the first route found at the base of Static Point - the first bolt 30' off the ground should get your attention and also set the tone for the rest of the climb.\n\nA new rappel route, with anchors, allows for the use of a single 60m rope.
