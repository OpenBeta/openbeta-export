Surmount the first roof, and move into the break below the second bulge using the super positive knob. Sink the most positive hand jam of all time, and pull yourself over the second bulge, using any or all of the following: high feet, sidepulls, fingerlocks, ringlocks, figure fours, wacky dance moves, and stemming. Â A short stretch of face climbing and cracks above the bulge take you to the chains.","protection":"2 bolts and a single set of cams from tips to thin hands","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,0bb1bb37-18ee-5769-974b-2b238388e482,a701bef6-2ff8-5c72-9aea-afe92f0bc5fa,291f6ff0-b64e-5b80-9f26-4cc5ef1a0df2,43daed05-fe0d-51ad-9955-64741f15947b,620a2f70-bc4d-520a-99c2-77397fec176c","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Skykomish Valley","Index","Upper Wall, Lower Tier and Trail","Outcrops on UTW trail","Mineshaft Wall, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.56724,47.82044]},"bbox":[-121.56790967902938,47.819990339818126,-121.5665703209706,47.82088966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120844892","area_id":"YgovcLxNUgqZwnc5f+wXbA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:44.041Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:50:36.878Z"}
