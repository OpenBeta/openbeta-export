In Leavenworth, this route would easily be rated 5.9+ or 5.10A.\n\nTo approach, just cross the tracks, go slightly uphill, and trend diagonally right to the closest wall.

Belay on the ledge. 25 feet\n\nMove your belay over to the base of the finger-crack on the climber's right.\n\nPitch #2 - 5.8 - Jam or lieback up the thin fingers to tips crack in the left facing corner. Scramble up to the base of the squeeze and belay at the fixed bong. 70 feet\n\nPitch #3 - 5.8+ - Wrestle and grunt your way up the vertical featureless superslick flared squeeze chimney.
