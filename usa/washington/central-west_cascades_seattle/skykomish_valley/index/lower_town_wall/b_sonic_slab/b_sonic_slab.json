Terminal Preppie offers multiple 5.11 cruxes with a great blend of power and finesse.\n\nClimb easily to the first bolt, then ponder the first crux:  an insecure friction sequence to nab a good jug below the roof.  Undercling right and power over the bolt-protected roof (5.10 if you do it right), then balance up to a short crack/flake.  Place a small wired if you want, or run it out to clip the first bolt of a fantastic three-bolt crimping sequence on matchstick to half-inch edges.  The highly technical ultimate crux comes at the last bolt, starting off a good stance, which is good because it might take awhile to decipher.\n\nAh, but it's not over!  After a moderate runout (good holds will appear), sidle up on a flake below the final roof and place a small wired (good placements).  The final 5.11 crux pulls the roof on thin jams to a bomber rail, with a welcome horizontal hand crack at the back.","protection":"5 bolts (old bolts replaced in 2007), plus a few supplemental pieces.  Definitely bring small wireds for the upper roof and for protecting the small crack/flake above the first roof.  A #1 Camalot works well in the flake getting to the first bolt.  A #3 Wild Country Rock is perfect for the upper roof.  You can place a #2 Camalot in the final horizontal hand crack.","location":"Approach as for Roger's Corner.
