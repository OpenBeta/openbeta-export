Well-bolted slab climbing grows in difficulty until a distinct, thin crux section. After the crux, there is a much easier runout either right to an anchor on TPMV below its 10d mantle pitch or to a higher anchor via a dike and easy roof. Natural gear protects the dike and the moves over the roof. The crux of the route is infamous for being rather thin for the grade, especially during the warm season. Descend from the anchor above the roof or better yet continue to the anchor at the top of the TPMV/Japanese Gardens routes via 5.7-5.8 slab climbing for a full size pitch.","protection":"Bolts and gear to 1 inch. Bolted anchors.","location":"The best approach is probably via Princely Ambitions (.9) and Dr. Sniff and the Tuna Boaters (.10+). From the anchor at the top of the latter climb, scramble up and right across a grassy ledge to an anchor below the slab. Beware of loose debris on the ledge: anything that falls could easily land on someone below! One 70m rope will get you down the wall, with a variety of anchor choices available."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.491Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.491Z"},{"_id":"09QnO39gU26PyZY2VBYBIA==","name":"Lamar's Trust","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"Gregs Mckenna and Olsen","type":{"trad":true,"sport":false,"bouldering":false,"alpine":false,"snow":false,"ice":false,"mixed":false,"aid":false,"tr":false},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.57147,47.81854]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"117622118","mp_crag_id":"107721455","areaRef":"zp7T7boDW36klDimghol1w=="},"content":{"description":"Might be a bit scruffy and the bolts might still be 1/4\"  This route and the following pitch that goes to the top of the wall contain really fun climbing and are atypical for Index.  Perhaps someone will be inspired to brush them off and upgrade the hardware.\n\nClimb crack/corner just to the left of Beak!
