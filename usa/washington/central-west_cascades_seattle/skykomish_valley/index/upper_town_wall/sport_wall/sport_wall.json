The crux is pretty much right off the belay, with a nice edging sequence that though thin and difficult, will seem straightforward after the trickery on the previous pitch. Be mindful of falling onto your belayer as you weave tenuously back and forth directly above her. After this, it's relatively smooth sailing until a perplexing section that may vary in difficulty (inversely) proportional to height of climber. My memory of the remainder is foggy and/or non-existant, but none of it is as hard as the beginning section. A nice counterpoint to Calling Wolfgang and a must-do if things went well enough on that route that you and your partner are up there already.

It demands four stars but has seen very little traffic over the years. After an initial gear placement climb airy 5.11 edging past three bolts. An easier section in the middle takes a small to medium sized nut before bolts appear again and the difficulty begins to ramp up. Suffice it to say that with relatively few ascents, just where and what comprises the crux is somewhat debatable, but it is most certainly in the vicinity of the last few bolts. For me at 5'7\", there was a reachy move from nebulous, bad holds around the second-to-last bolt, followed by a high-step maneuver that seemed as though it should've been easy but wasn't. One attempt made me throw my shoes in the bushes nearby while the next saw me redpoint, so it probably comes down to minutiae and the vagaries of tricky \"steep low-angle\" climbing. As with most Index routes, it is somewhat temperature dependent and even sunlight filtered heavily by trees on those 80% RH, 80 degree summer afternoons can make an appreciable difference to ones experience and ego.\n\nThe pitch above this is called Straight to Voicemail.

To take advantage of the aforementioned insurance, bring a green or red C4 and a few small to medium nuts along with the 12 quickdraws.
