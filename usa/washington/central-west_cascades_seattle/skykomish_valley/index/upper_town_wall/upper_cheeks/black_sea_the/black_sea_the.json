It is also possible to climb half way up Echolocation then move right at the overlap onto P1 of Gods Bones midway up and lower off of bolts there.  This allows the second to clean all the gear off of Echolocation before lowering down to the poop deck and pulling the rope for a lead, leaving two of the bolts on Gods Bones hung.\n\nHung gear may offend the sensibilities of...some people.
