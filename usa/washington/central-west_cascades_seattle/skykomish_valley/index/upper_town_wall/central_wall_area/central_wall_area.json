In reality, the route merely suffers from a well-known Index paradox: like most long Upper Town Wall free routes, despite the fact that Rise and Fall is amazing and was established in the 90's at a relatively modest grade, it saw few (if any?) subsequent ascents until the summer of 2010. With more traffic, the climb has been rediscovered as a classic. The alleged runout section on the 5.10- second pitch isn't runout at all; it seems bolts may have been added at some point in the past, or perhaps the information was suspect to begin with. Appropriately, the climb was named after an incident involving one of the first ascentionists and an unfortunate rappel off the ends of his ropes while descending the route. Miraculously, he limped away from the fifty foot ground fall and subsequent tumble with a mere broken ankle (and maybe a few ribs; story can be found in old Climbing or Rock and Ice magazine)! Anyway, here are the pitch descriptions:\n\n(Approach via Green Dragon or Davis Holland)\n\nP1: Climb the corner that comprises the second pitch of Green Dragon past four bolts before moving left onto a face. Traverse left with difficulty, then up a quartzite dike that leads to crux passing a roof. Liebacking and face climbing on the continuing dike leads to an anchor (.12a/b)\n\nP2: Airy climbing up a dike leads past a roof and some really cool rock to another belay atop a small ledge (.10a). A short pitch, but fun and interesting.\n\nP3: A fairly short pitch that packs a wicked punch; consensus is that this may actually be the crux of the climb. From the belay, climb right and up more quartz holds and some knobs in a corner to a crack lieback. Climb the roof above the lieback via edges and pull over onto a slab with a really tough and tenuous mantle. Get your magic toes ready and pull off another improbable mantle-like move and a few really thin slab moves before the difficulty relents and a belay is reached (.11d++).\n\nP4: Climb a long and varied slab with some wild pockets (even a monodoigt or two!), roofs, bulges and a couple of thin crux sections (.11c).\n\nP5: Climb overhanging, blocky rock to an anchor below the top of the Upper Town Wall (.10b). Loose in places; one of the bolts is in a hanging three or four ton block stack that vibrated when I sounded it out, so use caution. There is natural gear near the bolt if attaching yourself to it makes you nervous. Short pitch.\n\nEither do another twenty feet of climbing to reach the very top or, more prudently, rappel the route.","protection":"Mostly bolts, but gear is required on the approach pitch and some finger-sized cams are crucial for a safe experience on the rest of the climb. Aside from the first pitch, I used one small cam on each of the pitches except the second (5.10a) pitch. A singles rack from small to .5 Camalot size will provide good options for the placements. 16 draws, including some runners, were more than enough for us. For either of the approach pitches, hand sized pieces and a good selection of stoppers will supplement the smaller cams nicely. Doubles in finger size cams useful for the 5.11a option.\n\nAll the anchors are chain equipped, have at least two bolts and are in good shape.","location":"Approach the route via Davis Holland P1 (a fun 5.9 varied hand crack and fourth class ledges) or via Green Drag-on P1 (a really cool 5.11- varied finger crack and fourth class ledges). Bring nuts for the finger crack option. Belay beneath a large right-facing corner with some bolts and a flake at the start.

A two-bolt anchor lies on the left side of the chimney on top of a small ledge.\n\nP2: 5.10a, 5.10c A0, or 5.11c, depending on how you go - The original route, with a single bolt for aid if you traverse right from the anchors. Pulling on a sling brings you to a crack system; these moves go free at 5.11c.\n\nThe more common way is to continue up the chimney for about 20 feet then follow a crack on a ramp that goes down and right to a shallow corner. Done this way the pitch is overall 5.10a.\n\nEither way, from this point continue up a crack in a small corner until some large solid holds become available, then rightward and upward to a mantle onto a large ledge and the anchors.\n\nP3: From the anchors climb up the quartz-like face, past one bolt, to some cracks that will take gear. Hand and footholds are numerous but many are downsloping. Continue directly upward to the anchors, or bail out leftward into the pine trees. This pitch probably deserves an R rating.\n\nFor descent, you may rappel the route with 2 60m ropes, use one of many rappel options to climber's left, or walk off easily. To find the trail, go leftward until you find the dirt road, follow it until you reach a steel and cable barricade, and go left.

Traverse rightwards on perfect rock to a\n\nhighly\n\nmagical crux deadpoint to one perfectly placed knob and a tenuous hand/foot match, ~V8. A few easier moves lead to a good rest on a bread loaf hold where you can calm down and commit to the tenuous and obscure slab sequence that guards the anchor.
