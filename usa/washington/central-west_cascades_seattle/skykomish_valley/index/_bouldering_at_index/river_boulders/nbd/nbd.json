I mostly did this out of a lack of being able to find anything else that was climbable, and in my skill level, due to a very high river. Hands on the left corner of the rock, and one foot on the big, sloping base near the bottom of the boulder. Then move up from there, working your feet up slopey pockets and hands along the edge, avoiding the moss that lives on the rock. It's a quick climb with only a few moves, and a fun little start. Nothing particularly special, but it's something to do that's on the easy side. Good for a beginner.","protection":"Bring a crashpad. Possibly 2 to help with the awkward landing zone.","location":"Facing NBD, looking at it in the direction of the river from the small basin this climb starts in, you'll see it. I started as pictured (see photo). The downclimb off the top uses a rock to the left."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.677Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.677Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,0bb1bb37-18ee-5769-974b-2b238388e482,a701bef6-2ff8-5c72-9aea-afe92f0bc5fa,b409060b-05a9-58f1-aa19-f51dc2d53f2b,0cc112c2-79e6-58e1-9a9e-4b434a2fc0e9,20492eef-29aa-5999-999b-cdd0ee04feda","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Skykomish Valley","Index","** Bouldering at Index","River Boulders","NBD"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2-"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.60163,47.81713]},"bbox":[-121.60229963633613,47.816680339818134,-121.60096036366387,47.817579660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109033741","area_id":"IEku7ymqWZmZm83Q7gT+2g=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:05.254Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:50.044Z"}
