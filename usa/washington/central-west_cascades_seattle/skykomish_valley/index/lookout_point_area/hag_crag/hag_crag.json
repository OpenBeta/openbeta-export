Then jam and layback up the crack. One can belay on the same bolted anchors of End run and Game on.\n\nA challenge with the crux is that the flake crack is invisible to you when you have to move over. It is a blind reach. Look for where the left face of the corner has an upper (third) crack that can be jammed or underclung. Here is the place. That crack is actually the other side of the crack you are shooting for. It is a big reach. Some may have to dyno for it. And if you are under 5' tall, it may be physically impossible to make the reach. Doing a two-handed dyno would be very awkward from the way the corner and crack are situated (dynoing around a bulge). So, the given rating is more of a minimum. I suppose most routes are body-size dependent, but this route may be more so than most.","protection":"Full range of sizes.\n\nAt the bottom, a few finger-to-hand size nuts and cams.

It seems faster and easier to do with one's feet on the slab, ones back or hands against the top.
