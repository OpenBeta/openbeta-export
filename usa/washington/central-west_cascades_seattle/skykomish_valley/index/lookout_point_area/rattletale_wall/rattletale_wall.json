Funky laybacking leads past first bolt to crimpy section at second bolt. Perplexing jugs lead past couple bolts to last bolt where a compression boulder problem guards the chains! Better lead than top roped. You can skip the final crux by going around to left side of arete if going direct is too tricky. Not all climbs need to be over bolted. If you need bolts every 4 feet look elsewhere.","protection":"Quickdraws","location":"Left of Chasing the Lizard, on small subbuttress"},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.867Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:11.867Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,0bb1bb37-18ee-5769-974b-2b238388e482,a701bef6-2ff8-5c72-9aea-afe92f0bc5fa,412ee74c-14c2-5cd5-95ee-ba8cca64e08d,a4e9b1e0-463b-559d-a979-5e8f50beb3e3","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Skykomish Valley","Index","Lookout Point Area","Rattletale Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c/d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"V2"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":13,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":6,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":8,"advanced":7,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.5613,47.8243]},"bbox":[-121.5619697288264,47.82385033981815,-121.5606302711736,47.82474966018188],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106204432","area_id":"pOmx4EY7VZ2peV6PUL6z4w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":18,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:05.482Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:50.462Z"}
