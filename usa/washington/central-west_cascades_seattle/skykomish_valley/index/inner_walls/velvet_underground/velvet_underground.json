The line takes an obvious clean path up a steep arete starting with moderate face climbing which leads into a powerful and well protected crux.

The climb is about 8-10 minutes of bush walking past Foodbar then Fire wall on your left side. You will continue down the canyon via path of least resistance until the wall is visible on right (east)?
