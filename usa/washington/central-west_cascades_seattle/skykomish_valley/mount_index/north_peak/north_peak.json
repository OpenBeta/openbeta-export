The first ascent party consisting of Schoening and Beckey climbed in sneakers over two nights. They reached the summit of the north peak by noon on the first day, before spending a night on the middle and main summits.\n\nModern parties can likely do the route in one night, with the cruxes being water and conditions. Climbing early season can bring more snow, but greater risk of rock falling down from overhead. Late season brings less overhead hazard, but snow/water becomes rare. A traverse in any season will be quite the serious endeavor.\n\nRegardless of when you climb it, be prepared for amazing views and a lot of loose rock.","protection":"Single alpine rack and a handful or two of rappels worth of tat if comfortable at the grade.","location":"Start at the lake.
