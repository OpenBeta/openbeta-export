Turn right and cross a waterfall gully, which can be extremely hazardous depending on the season. Continue along a forest path until the trees disperse at the base of another large cliff. Traverse along the base until you reach a gully. Keep on the left side while ascending upward if you don't like battling through slide alder. (Hint: you don't.) Once at the top of the ridge, follow it north. Downclimb slabs (2nd class) east to a gully, which you will descend. This is all to get around Point 5760+. Traverse around the rock summit, and follow another gully back up again. Don't go to the top, turn right at a ramp so as not to dead-end at cliffs. This ramp is 3rd class and the crux - beware of rockfall or icy conditions. Once at the top, traverse east over talus and climb north to a notch. Here is the famous ledge traverse - traverse a famous thin ledge. This can be very dangerous if conditions are adverse, although it isn't technically difficult. Class 3 climbing up the ridge leads to summit.","protection":"None, nothing requires belaying, but caution, good routefinding skills and a careful eye on the weather are essential.","location":"From Highway 2, turn left on Barclay Creek Road (marked as FS Road 6024). Park at the Barclay Lake TH, or if you like complicated vehicle maneuvers, park on a spur logging road nearby which cuts a tiny slice of elevation off the climb. Follow said spur road to a firepit. A faint path leads to the crossing of Barclay Creek. Bushwhack (difficult) uphill until reaching an old, unused road. Follow the road left to another firepit; a climber's trail leads upslope from the second firepit area. This trail is a good place to call the start of the route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,0bb1bb37-18ee-5769-974b-2b238388e482,0dbf55ac-a79d-5359-a58d-d8f4e38fb3bd","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Skykomish Valley","Gunn Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.4477,47.81621]},"bbox":[-121.44836962447106,47.81576033981813,-121.44703037552893,47.81665966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120237182","area_id":"Db9VrKedU1mljdj044+zvQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-121.44836962447106,47.81576033981813],[-121.44703037552893,47.81576033981813],[-121.44703037552893,47.81665966018186],[-121.44836962447106,47.81665966018186],[-121.44836962447106,47.81576033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:30:46.325Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:08:27.787Z"}
