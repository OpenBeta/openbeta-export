Sit start on good jugs, right hand is around the arete.  Easy move to a sharp incut hold then move up to a slopey side pull.  From here bump up to the semi positive sloper a foot or so above your right hand, this is the crux move and if you miss you crash into the stump behind you.  Once you establish your right hand left foot high step and move out to the left hand jug just below the lip.  Finally right hand on the lip, left up to the jug just above the lip and finish with a scary mantel onto a mossy slab. The topout needs some cleaning, I didn't have any good brushes but it is still do-able just a tab more scary.","protection":"Two pads are good, a spotter might be good too, but not necessary.","location":"The west forest, drive almost to the end of the road.  Park at the last wide spot before you reach the end of the road and look up hill.  There is a huge boulder coming out of the hillside, hike up to this and around the right and look about 15-20 yards up hill you will see money shot.  Have fun!"},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.210Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:12.210Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,0bb1bb37-18ee-5769-974b-2b238388e482,80b98a59-7a0f-5b2a-a3d3-4f8a5172d040,a404e99a-f147-52fe-b93b-6f1173b948e5,11bea39c-893e-5369-a290-6e75ab8f3f28,904cead8-2d96-5a2c-98c5-4ef71dd620f0","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Skykomish Valley","Gold Bar Boulders","Forest","West Forest","Money Shot Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2+"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-121.611,47.84942]},"bbox":[-121.61167005314933,47.848970339818145,-121.61032994685067,47.84986966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118332125","area_id":"kEzq2C2WWiyYxU73HdYg8A=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:06.188Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:51.313Z"}
