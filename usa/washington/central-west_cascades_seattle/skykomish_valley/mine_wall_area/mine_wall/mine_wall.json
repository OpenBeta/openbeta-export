This route is the full extended version of Greedy.  Climb to the first belay on Greedy (6 bolts or so).  Climb Greedy (SO GOOD) and just keep on trucking, clipping very nice hardware as things get steeper and steeper.  There are 2 discrete cruxes separated by a good rest.  Clipping the anchor is kind of desperate if you don't nail the finishing sloper just right.  To me, the last boulder problem felt V6/7 ish.\n\nThere is one block that I would be careful with.  But I think you don't really have to touch it.","protection":"Bolts","location":"I'd recommend an 80 meter rope.  But a 70 could work if you pull back into the wall to the first belay.
