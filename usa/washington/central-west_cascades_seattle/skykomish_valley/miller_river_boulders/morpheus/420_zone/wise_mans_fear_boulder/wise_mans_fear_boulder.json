Use feet out right.  Go up on good holds to arete/lip.  Go to the top using the left arete.  Do some wizard $hit and high steps while using the slopey hand holds on the arête to make a desperate move to the top.  Very rewarding. A low start on the footholds of the normal prob adds a grade to the problem and a couple fun moves.","protection":"As many pads and spotters as you can bring unless you have cajones to do it solo.","location":"On the right side of the trail up the slope in the talus field.
