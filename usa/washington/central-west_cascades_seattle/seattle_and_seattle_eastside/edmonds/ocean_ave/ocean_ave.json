See location info below for approach beta. The route goes straight northeast for nearly a mile on stacked granite blocks. Conditions are best on a flowing tide between 6 and 8 feet. Any higher (or an ebbing tide) and expect the rock to be slippery, any lower and it will feel more contrived since you could just as easily walk below the rock band.\n\nContinue sideways past old pitons (railroad spikes), several tricky gendarmes, skittish crabs, and the occasional freight train. Once you \"top out\" and reach more scrambly terrain, you have completed the route. A few descent options exist in order of distance from the route's top-out:\n\n1. You may be able to traverse around the Lynnwood Wastewater plant and onto Bertola Rd (I have not tried this).\n\n2. You can continue upcoast and hop over the fence at the abandoned pier.\n\n3. You can exit more legally via the Meadowdale Park trail.\n\nI have completed this traverse in the South-to-North direction, but I did consider a possible North-to-South and it would be futuristic to say the least.","protection":"Handful of chocks and a wetsuit if you aren't comfortable at the grade.","location":"The good rock begins at 47.8286, -122.3659 and ends at 47.8393, -122.3543.
