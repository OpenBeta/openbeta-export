Continue up the eastern pillar to a 6’ dyno (big fall potential here).  Climb into the bridge and stem between the beams for thirty feet, then drop down and monkey through a few moves before wildly swinging into the iron cross (more big fall potential).  Continue the monkey a few more moves before mantling onto the beam ledge.  Intentionally sandbagged thin edges and greasy pockets will lead you through the final overhang of the bridge deck.  Another challenging mantle leads to the top.  A UW Gymastics Team training ground favorite.","protection":"No pro","location":""},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:08.095Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:08.095Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,cfe129f6-5f60-5bc8-87b3-3d3bfaff9472,7e417346-4bea-5085-9f18-3c0f60efd272,578b6bb9-7c13-53d3-abbb-bbb1a5cbcfd8,3be9aa8e-b170-5d0c-aa7c-3864d60a8d80,f7f70d2e-b73b-517a-b047-a0d6c489c75a","pathTokens":["USA","Washington","Central-West Cascades & Seattle","Seattle and Seattle Eastside","Seattle Urban Climbing","Ramps To Nowhere"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.29441,47.64408]},"bbox":[-122.2950774149429,47.64363033981814,-122.29374258505712,47.64452966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118293424","area_id":"9/cNLrc7UXqwR6DWxInHWg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:03.444Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:46.351Z"}
