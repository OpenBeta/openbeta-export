Faces SouthWest (so good bet for afternoon on a cool day). Much is shaded by mature trees, so not as hot as might expect on hot afternoons.\n\n Straightforward access on official maintained trail then unofficial \"herd paths\".\n\n A bit south from the true \"hollow\" so a bit more noise than some other sectors. Some swampy land near the base, so likely more insects than some other sectors -- could be better after it's been dry for a while.\n\n More climbing nearby at sector Sloane, just below NW.\n\n Top-Roping: Obvious way to reach the top of this cliff to set up a top anchor is to scramble up (slippery) around the left (north) side.\n\n Name: Vaclav \"Vic\" Benes is like the grandfather of New Jersey climbing. While working as a mathematician at Bell Labs, he got many long-time NJ climbers (using the \"Murray Hill Canoe Club\") excited about climbing - (One of those Bell Labs climbers with a big impact was Neil Sloane who with Paul Nick later authored the climbing guidebook for NJ). Benes also made important contributions to the mathematical theory of stochastic processes with applications to voice communication. Bell Labs in Murray Hill NJ during that time was one of the top technological research centers in the world, and supported the largest land-line \"telephone\" network.\n\nFirst Ascents? When we started exploring this rock sector, we discovered lots of previous work (cleaning + cutting) to prepare the rock and cliff top and base and approaches for climbing. So we could focus on just trying different possible routes for climbing. Whoever did that work, please contact us so we can give proper credit for your First Ascents.\n\nwarning: Loose rock is still a concern in this sector. Belayer or other members of party should not stand anywhere near underneath the climber or underneath a leader setting up top anchor.\n\n . . . (Lots of vegetation on this rock as of 2018.
