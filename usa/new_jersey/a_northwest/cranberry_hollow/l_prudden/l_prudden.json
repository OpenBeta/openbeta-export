First Ascent in the 1950s of \"Bonnie's Roof\" the great classic Gunks route, and other FAs. Devastating in every way: athletic, smart, charming, pretty -- skier, dancer. And a self-driven climber from childhood: When her parents told her to stay up in her room, she would just climb out the window. Later climbed classic mountain routes in Switzerland and Italy. In 1954 built one of the first public artificial climbing walls in USA.\n\n Working together with Hans Krauss (the FA leader of \"High Exposure\" the other great classic Gunks route), discovered a new approach for children's health and strength, and she was named to the first US President's Council on Physical Fitness. 1957 cover photo on famous national magazine, sponsorship of popular healthy breakfast cereal, then her own television show. Which left no time for climbing. Then she organized and promoted a drug-free approach to managing pain and focused on that. Two of her rather helpful devices are the BoDo and the Crook -- simpler than competing devices, but perhaps more effective for climbers.\n\nwarning: Loose rock is still a concern in this sector.
