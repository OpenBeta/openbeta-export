(If possible perhaps better to place an etrier / aid ladder over the deep crack to the right where the overhang is less steep, using trad gear instead of the tree)\n\n Start below the 6-ft-tall overhanging break mid-way up the slab, 2 ft left from above thick mature tree. Up the slab to below the pine tree growing out of the rock just above the left side of the overhanging break. Use Aid to surmount the break, the up the middle of the slab above to finish between two mature pine/cedar trees.\n\nwarning: The rock on and near this route has not been climbed much yet, and some of the rock is still breakable and loose -- so the belayer and other people should stand far away from underneath the climber or someone setting up top anchor.\n\n . . . (Lots of vegetation on this rock as of 2018.

Routes 30-60 ft, facing mainly South, some West.\n\n Cool weather days nice in afternoon due to favorable exposure. Much is shaded by mature trees, so not as hot as might expect on hot afternoons.\n\n Top-Roping: Access to set up anchors by bushwhacking from approach trail to sector Benes. Or from the bottom by scrambling up around Right (E) side, but this has a rather slippery and exposed segment.\n\n Name: Mark Ronca pioneered many of the hardest routes in western New Jersey. Then took his rock and ice climbing expertise out to Colorado, and became a climbing ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nFirst Ascents? When we started exploring this rock sector, we discovered lots of previous work (cleaning + cutting) to prepare the rock and cliff top and base and approaches for climbing. So we could focus on just trying different possible routes for climbing. Whoever did that work, please contact us so we can give proper credit for your First Ascents.\n\nwarning: Loose rock is still a concern in this sector. Belayer or other members of party should not stand anywhere near underneath the climber or underneath a leader setting up top anchor.\n\n . . . (Lots of vegetation on this rock as of 2018.
