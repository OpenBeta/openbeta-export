Sometimes climbed and traveled for climbing with Bonnie Prudden. But instead of adding more climbing achievements, he virtually invented modern sport medicine. Although trained as a surgeon, he promoted using non-surgical techniques for treating injuries and alleviating pain, and advocated including exercise for recovery instead of mainly \"bed rest\". Wrote best-selling book for relieving pain without drugs, and organized a nationwide program to teach it to people.\n\nwarning: Loose rock is still a concern in this sector.
