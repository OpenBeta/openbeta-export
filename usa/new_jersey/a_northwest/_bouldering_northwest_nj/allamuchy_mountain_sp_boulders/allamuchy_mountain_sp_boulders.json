The quality of some of the rock is a bit chossy so bring a brush and test questionable holds. There are some amazing holds and features in Allamuchy and the friction is typically high and textures run the gamut from slick crystal to coarse feldspar.\n\n There are two trails from the parking lot: one is to the right as you enter the lot and is marked with teal blazes as part of the Highlands Trail. The other is to the left side of the lot and is unmarked.\n\n Do not trespass on the Scout Reservation. Signs make the boundary apparent. As facing up the hill on the unmarked trail, to the right is Allamuchy Mountain State Park, the left is restricted. The unmarked trail leads first to Look Mom! then to Drop Top which is off trail to the right and then The Karate Kid boulder further up the trail at the top of the hill. Over the hill and trending right is off trail access to the back area: Cumulus, Nimbus, Tall Wall, Big Fat Pauly, Z CRACKS.\n\n Follow TEAL blazes from the lot to the left fork and across the first small stream for Doorknob area. This is the closest quality climbing to the parking area. Across the second stream bed is Cracked Boulder/Cross Stitch, Pickle and Leopard Print Pumps (LPP off trail) further up teal at the topoint of the hill. Follow the second streambed over big talus and blocks to The Spear, Darth Maul, gallery of the Sith (some of the hardest and highest quality), Tall Wall and Cumulus/Nimbus and much more interesting rock.\n\n There are other boulders along Waterloo Rd which are worth stopping and looking for. Please be respectful of the folks that live in the State Park and do not park on or walk through any private property.\n\n !Leave nothing but chalk marks! That means no trail markers, no dog poop, no cig butts, beer cans, tape balls or other refuse, and definitely no camping or fire making, ever!! Please be respectful of the land, rock, wildlife, other hikers, bikers, hunters and climbers that use this area.\n\n There are still some moderate and hard projects at Allamuchy, even true classics to be unlocked! Those which I know of and have worked to develop will be listed here with a clear indication that the ascent is either unknown or is a definite, unclimbed project. If you claim an ascent or have more proper and historical beta, please contact hennehammocks@gmail.com or direct message me on MP. I love this place and I hope you share my passion! I want to represent and report on this beta page correctly and as accurately as possible and we can help each other to share the amazing climbing in Allamuchy! Thank you all for your hard work and input to make bouldering in Allamuchy a true experience."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":72,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:55.370Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:00.310Z"}
