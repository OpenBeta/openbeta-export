Climbing is legal here but you must enter from Allamuchy State Park's Green Trail. Do not cross private property. Just North of Cranberry Lake in Byram Township are several outcrops ranging in height from 20 to 35 feet. These outcrops were heavily used in the 1990's and offer some great climbing. Some locals cleaned them up in recent years but no first ascents from the ground up have been established. Old pictures of climbers on these outcrops can be found on newspapers.com. We'll have pictures and more route information up soon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:55.931Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:16.612Z"}
