Some people call it Tomahawk. The “Indian head” feature can be seen clearly from across the river o the Pennsylvania side of the Gap. It’s an iconic feature first noticed I the mid-1800’s by tourists on the Lackawanna Railroad. This route starts at the left-facing arete just to the right of the split tree. \n\nPitch 1: Climb up 15 feet and slant left continuing up another arete to a ledge. Continue up and into the dihedral with a crack to another ledge with bushes. Belay here. \n\nPitch 2: Exit left and traverse the ledges to the arete then up to the top.","protection":"Standard gap rack: Small to medium cams, 2 large cams, set of stoppers, few small tri-cams.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"AOPVPmPDVAaDSdGiaOj7xg==","name":"Denture Grip","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.11129,40.9693]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"115789641","mp_crag_id":"107238804","climb_id":"AOPVPmPDVAaDSdGiaOj7xg==","areaRef":"d3+Lh0hFUqmvdIIlMgAteQ=="},"content":{"description":"This route starts the same as ‘Indian Head’.\n\nPitch 1: Follow ‘Indian Head’ up for 40 feet to the left of the overhangs.
