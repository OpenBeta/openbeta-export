Pitch#3, Work up and to the left till just under the ceiling at another outside corner, now a long traverse left following just under the ceiling until reaching a sharp corner which you must climb up to make your way up to the top.

Final pitch also R. Small cams a Must. Tree anchors on top but i did not use it. I hiked out.  NOTE: communication is very difficult on this climb. There is 2 instances where you will loose site of your partner and cannot see or hear them due to wind and highway. You will need to both be comfortable with rope signals, or shouting like crazy people, but even shouting was mis-comunicated so be very weary.","location":"To find at great arch wall look up at the massive ceiling above, start far Right, scramble up to a small ledge with a tree on it.

The pitch has gear where you need it, but by no means plentiful. The pitch finishes in a very cramped belay dike/ledge after some fun moves. The second pitch goes up to the obvious roof above, with no true rest.  The roof is then exited by traversing 15ft right on underclings and smears/small feet and then up to a pair of bolts in good condition and rap rings. BE WARNED, if the second blows it during the roof section there is no easy way of getting back on the wall as they will be left dangling in space with 80ft of clean air below them.  Also worth noting, the gear directly above to belay on pitch 2 is pg13/R for about ten feet and a slip here would be bad news. Additionaly if the leader goes for a ride during the roof section, with rope stretch and swing they could easily drop kick the belayer. For a bonus third pitch you can top out and wander back to the corkscrew rap station on your left, or stay roped up and make your way to the climbers left over some grassy ledges with no protection to the same station.","protection":"Assortment of nuts, cams from .3-3 doubles...0.75 helpful.   Double ropes to rappel (60m)","location":"The start can be found 25 meters up hill from triumvirate, easiest to belay from a flat spot in the wash below the dihedral while the leader scrambles up a section of 5.3R to their first piece.
