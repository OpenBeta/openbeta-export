You can accomplish some of the routes, like 'The Rib', with a 70 meter rope and 1 pitch but 2 ropes are needed for rappelling. If you gain access to the top of the cliff (lower  headwall), you can walk down the Class III slope and it eventually meets up with several old trails (grey & yellow), but they are no longer blazed and maintained. The were originally blazed by Hugh Dougher in the late 1970's and then reblazed by Joey Vulpis and Micky Levine in the early 2000's.
