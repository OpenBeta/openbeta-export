Your initial goal is to stand on top of that ceiling. Turning to pass the ceiling is a crux move.....look for a hand jam in this move to help you.  At crux, there is a large loose rock on your right...be careful not to grab.  The crux move might be much higher than 5.6. After passing the roof, climb up to the easy access ledge, which has many thorns, and belay.LINK Pitch 2 and 3 together: Pass the small roof that is just above the belay station by directly going up through the roof or by stepping 5ft to the right and accessing the easier arete and face.  This small roof is 10-15ft above the belay station.Climb up to the corner directly above 2nd roof and follow it until huge overhangs force you hard left and out to the obvious arete to your left that turns 90 degrees and places you on a new face. This is easy climbing in this section (5.4).  The rock in this corner and as you escape the roof at the very top of the climb (according to the old description pitch 2) is often bad, and no good belay can now be created at the 90 deg turn from the one face to the other.  Once you make this 90deg turn, you'll be out from underneath the large roof that was above you (for the old description of pitch 2) and find a new corner to climb with no roof above you. From above 2nd small roof to 90 deg turn is 85ft.Continue up now in the new obvious corner.  Pass the 2 trees very near the top (found in my other pic) because they have become suspect raps to the more solid rock at the top out to make an anchor.  It would be better to top out and walk your way back over to the triumvirate face and rap down off of THE RIB route. The 2nd corner section is about 80ft long.","protection":"Standard gap rack: Small to medium cams, 2 large cams, set of stoppers, few small tri-cams.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"eb21ZsKlVwuOLcHURKMX2Q==","name":"\"V\" The Final Battle","yds":"5.11d","grades":{"yds":"5.11d","french":"7a"},"fa":"Matt Hill & Mark Ronca 1996.
