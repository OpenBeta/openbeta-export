Hit it in the early spring before the foliage comes in. \n\n  Starting on the slab next to the open book that begins the rib, move up a groove to a small roof atop the slab.  Pull this on the right end, then pull up the larger roof at the middle on obvious jugs (well protected, but last decent gear for a bit).  Continue up until you reach a grassy ledge.  Belay on 1-1/2\" gear at the left end of the ledge. \n\n  P2 - Climb up the corner above the belay, then head hard right, fighting Poison Ivy and a birch tree, then move up onto the soft sloping dirt ledge (Loose rocks!), and weave thru the small trees to 20' of gorgeous crack (reminiscent of CCK at the Gunks) At the end of the crack, move left, avoiding a stack of loose-looking blocks and a tree, then up to the top.  Belay on small gear or trees. \n\n  Descend via The Rib with 2 single rope rappels or 1 double rope rappel. \n\n  Rope drag on P2 could be pretty bad with the way the route wanders.  For an alternative, Continue P1 straight up from the belay ledge (looks unprotected), and do a semi-hanging belay below P2.","protection":"Extra active gear in the 1-2\" size is helpful for the route as described - At the P1 belay there aren't many other options.
