Majority of the strip are unremarkable V-Beginner grade climbs which are fine for warming up. As of now, there are 5 solid climbable faces that can range from (pending on variation) V1-V4. \n\nCan’t get any easier to drive to and park. With parking right along the strip on both sides of the street and no access fees, a simple address plug-in of a local landmark into your GPS app of choice will get you there and set-up in no time.\n\n Plenty of sun and rides along the sidewalk so there is mild-to-moderate foot traffic with the occasional curious bystander (street connects two major roads in the city and shares a block with basketball courts and skate park). Pet friendly and have had zero issues with law/parking enforcement.\n\n I’m hoping this area to be discovered by someone who knows “rock type” soon but as of now, rock type and quality feel GOOD with 4 ascended faces and 1 ongoing project (so far by this v4/5.10 gumby)\n\n (Being this location and contributor are both new to MP, details and pictures are gradually being added so stay tuned - March2020)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:55.929Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:01.063Z"}
