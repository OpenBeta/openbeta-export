It's at the top of the cliff but outside the gate, so think you're allowed to climb it. One boulder, has a lot of holds and has about 40ft of climbing space, varying from heights of 5ft to 20ish ft. There is also a rock about 8ft tall and wide near it if you want to practice on that as well. both spots stay pretty dry, rain a few hours beforehand doesn't affect them."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:55.928Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:56.253Z"}
