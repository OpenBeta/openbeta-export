It is lined on both sides by cliffs similar to those at Watchung Reservation, except that the cliff are smaller, with easier climbing, and the rock is a bit more crumbly.  However, this location is quiet and peaceful on weekdays. On weekends, the spot should be avoided because of the crowds of picnickers.  Almost all of the climbing at Hemlock Falls is of easy to moderate difficulty."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:55.929Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:56.266Z"}
