Starting further right and using the Gaston as a left hand side pull doesn’t change the grade, but it’s not nearly as fun. One of the best routes in the park.","protection":"1-2 pads and a spotter","location":"Middle of the Heavenly Terrace Boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"eKvnr/YhVtmlAVNWQF8UZg==","name":"Blue Spotted Tail","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.37225,40.96761]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"120095010","mp_crag_id":"120094998","climb_id":"eKvnr/YhVtmlAVNWQF8UZg==","areaRef":"K5CBCnszX4eVSniDhl1nSQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start with your hands in the slanted horizontal crack, make your way up using a crimp, get a high foot and reach for a sloper up to the left.
