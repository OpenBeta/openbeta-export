It's a great experience for beginning boulderers, especially in the fall. The park isn't the super traveled, so it can get a bit overgrown in the summer months. Like most of New Jersey climbing, the area is heavily wooded, extremely humid, and buggy in the summers. If your climbing in the summer, bring a cooler, some bug spray, and a change of clothes (for the sweat). If your climbing in the Fall You'll probably come across some Princeton students, but that's about it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:55.374Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:47:00.105Z"}
