This is one of the oldest climbed cliffs in New Jersey after the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. James Waddell Alexander II, a native New Jerseyean from Sea Bright NJ who holds first ascents on Long's Peak in Colorado, was one of the oldest active climbers in the state of NJ. He frequented this cliff between 1915 and 1940. The rock is vertical and part of the Western lateral moraine of the Wisconsin glacier. Most of this land is NJ DEP property. Climbing is legal here but you must park your car off the road or in the lot just South of the cliff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:55.370Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:55.050Z"}
