Top out on a ledge about eight feet up below the big knob on top. The knob was too chossy for me to try to climb and has dirt and vegetation on top. The crux is getting onto the ledge. Use slopey holds on the ledge and (carefule) underclings above it to get up there.","protection":"","location":"Might be easiest to find it with coordinates. My phone gave me 38.266266, -86.531773 when I was there. You can start about .75 miles south and .25 miles east of the Hemlock Cliffs on a Forest Service road where it bends around a gully with a stream at the bottom. You can park around there and get down to the stream bed. Them follow it north and a bit east for about half a mile, and you'll see this boulder on the right, or east, slope of the gully. There are lots of chossy walls lining this gully covered in moss, but look out for this one that is relatively bare and that has cracks criss crossing it."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,ae7de25e-6cd6-512b-9e85-1dd9f7f53ab3,7ce7f80b-cd50-5fd6-a932-76dcaa5aa375","pathTokens":["USA","Indiana","Hemlock Cliffs"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.54047,38.27729]},"bbox":[-86.54104279948928,38.27684033981814,-86.53989720051071,38.27773966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112804985","area_id":"fOf4C81QX9apMnbcqlqjdQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-86.54104279948928,38.27684033981814],[-86.53989720051071,38.27684033981814],[-86.53989720051071,38.27773966018186],[-86.54104279948928,38.27773966018186],[-86.54104279948928,38.27684033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Located inside Hoosier National Forest, most of Hemlock Cliffs is open to climbing.
