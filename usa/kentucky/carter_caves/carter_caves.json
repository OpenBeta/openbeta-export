Crux is towards the roof where the rope comes over the rock. The rope can lay along the tree but will also rub on the rock edge. Lots of small crimps but great foot holds.

Bear right, and you will come to two small anchors near a large tree at the top of the route. Be careful when placing draws here (or anchor yourself to something prior).
