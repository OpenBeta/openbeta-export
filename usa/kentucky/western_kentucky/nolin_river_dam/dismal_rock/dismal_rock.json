Keep an eye out for the eagles that frequent this area.\n\nPitch 1 Classic Crack (5.8), Newly rebolted and will need 5 quickdraws to gain the bolted anchor located on the face above the large ledge.\n\nPitch 2 Hawkwind (5.10b/c) New Route and will need 10 quickdraws + Anchor.\n\nStep up and right of the anchor on good holds to clip the first bolt and meet with the angling arete. Face climb and follow the arete up to a comfortable rest at the fourth bolt before a minor heel hook crux. Roll onto the ledge and gain the proudest no hands rest in the area. Clip the 6th bolt and commit fully around the corner to pump it out, as the arete becomes less defined, to the redpoint crux at the 9th bolt. Finish by grabbing the best holds on the routes as the difficulty eases back and continue past one more bolt to the anchors. (climber can be lowered to the ground, instead of belaying from the top)\n\nPitch one and two can be TR from the ground using the pitch 2 anchors with a true 70m rope, but every quickdraw must be clipped on the way back down to prevent the climber from swinging into unclimbable territory.\n\n70 meter rope is recommended and can easily reach the ground on a rappel from the top. This route is easiest and most efficient if cleaned on TR. Please tie knots at the end of your rope.\n\nRappel Anchors have been added halfway down the rappel so a 60m rope can be used for a double rappel, instead of swinging over to another anchor station.","protection":"10 Bolts + Anchors","location":"Currently the only route on the main wall with new wave bolts.
