The climbing here is downright weird, with powerful, dynamic moves between heinous slopers and the occasional knob.  The business is quite bouldery, typical of the sloper problems one might find at a climbing gym.  Fortunately the rock here is ultra-grippy, but do yourself a favor and save this one for a cold day anyway.\n\nBegin with one easy move and a few hard ones to gain two good rails near the arete.  Work back left to the \"dong hold\", clip the 2nd bolt, and lunge between slopers to the obvious horizontal break.  Move left, make a big reach, then head back right toward the arete.  Make one more big move to reach the obvious pocket.  Follow more slopey pockets & disappointing pinches as the pump builds.  At the last bolt things finally ease up.  Move out right of the arete to the anchor.","protection":"~7 Bolts, 2BA.
