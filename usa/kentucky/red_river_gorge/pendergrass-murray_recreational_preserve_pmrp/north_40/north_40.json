Not a jug haul by any means.   Start by traversing in from the left on a crimp rail to reach a jug at the base of a crack/flake.

From the flake, aim for a large pocket, find a way to get up on a large jug and then figure out a way to reach the next jug up and left.   From here, the climbing eases up as the holds are very positive and the climbing is straight forward.
