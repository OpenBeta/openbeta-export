Regardless, this one is for you!\n\nAn amazing route that I unfortunately don't have much info on. The Ray Ellington guidebook reads something like \"This line will probably shut you down, and probably make you cry\". With a description like that you have to get on it, right?\n\nThe aggressive start only yields to more aggressive slab, delicate climbing, pinching tiny iron oxide deposits, an amazing technical challenge! The crux for me was either the awkward steep mantle, or clipping bolt 5/6... hate to take a real whip on this guy!\n\nThis one definitely reminds you why you love/hate climbing.

Follow the trail left about 100 feet and up to a large ivy grown wall with 2 clean gold streaks on the right.  Bleak December is the left of the two routes.  I believe the route in the streak 20 feet to the right is called \"Dainty Butterfly\" 12b - but I could be mistaken.\n\nFastest approach:  You can take a left fork off the approach trail to Oompa and Loompa.  Look for the uphill overgrown logging road about 40 feet after hopping over the small creek - approx 150 yards from the road.
