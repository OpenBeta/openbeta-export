For the aspiring 5.9/5.10 adventure trad leader this will test your mettle.\n\nStanding on the steel bridge over Red River look west toward an imposing vertical face high above the valley. The top of Nevermore is the left arching crack that can be seen right of center.\n\nNevermore can be climbed in 2-4 pitches depending on your rope length or pitch length preferences.\n\nTraditional pitch break up:\n\nPitch 1: Climb a left facing chimney to a ledge.\n\nPitch 2: Traverse horizontally left about 20 feet along an incut, but overhanging ledge to a tree at the base of a low angle crack. Follow the crack to a broad ledge and a bolted rap station. The big ledge was reportedly a popular place to camp back in the day. Alternately head left and up the face from the first belay to the second.\n\nPitch 3: Traverse out right from the bolted anchors on the big ledge to a vertical face with some bolts. Climb past the bolts to a semi-hanging belay at the start of the wide arching crack.\n\nPitch 4: Climb the wide, exposed crack to the summit.\n\nAlternately you can combine the first two pitches together and the last two pitches together.","protection":"Standard RRG rack. Bolted rap station on the ledge. Some bolts were missing hangers, but as of 10/2014, they're all there.  You cannot get to the ground from the bolts with a single 60m rope. Also, rope drag is horrendous. You may lose your rope if you don't extend the anchor with slings or cord.","location":"Hike up the old road and head left from the last switchback before you rise above the base of hte main face. Weave through the garbage and artifacts at the base until you can see the wide crack above and a left facing chimney to the right of a green slab.\n\nBest way to get down after topping out is to walk down the road."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8677a1b5-08b9-5ce8-b15f-0653205bbc48,78da26bc-cd94-5ac8-8e1c-815f7f30a28b,d51a127b-e771-5211-b1a9-bf5ad2703002,0aa4c5c3-a5a1-5de2-a348-566711603408","pathTokens":["USA","Kentucky","Red River Gorge","Northern Gorge","Raven Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.66614,37.83589]},"bbox":[-83.66670935519268,37.83544033981814,-83.66557064480733,37.83633966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105919809","area_id":"CqTFw6WhXeKjSFZnEWA0CA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-83.66670935519268,37.83544033981814],[-83.66557064480733,37.83544033981814],[-83.66557064480733,37.83633966018187],[-83.66670935519268,37.83633966018187],[-83.66670935519268,37.83544033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:03:52.806Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:28.494Z"}
