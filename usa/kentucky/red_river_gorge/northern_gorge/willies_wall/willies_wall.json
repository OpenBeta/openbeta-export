This route was not followed on the FA- I rapped down it and that was that.\n\nThis route name was derived from a review of the Album 'Our Time In Eden' by 10,000 Maniacs. The reviewer commented on it's almost suicidal depression and referred to it as \"The Theme ALbum for a Prozac Nation.\" Although I like the Album, the review stuck with me.\n\nThe climb was a little silly to have done ground-up, no preview, no cleaning and no gear to speak of.  Perhaps a failed suicide attempt, but I recall fear more than depression.\n\nClimb up the seam until it ends, making use of small edges and slopers, to the top of the wall.
