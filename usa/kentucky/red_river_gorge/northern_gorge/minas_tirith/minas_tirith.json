It was very cool to bike in to do this climb.\n\nThe route is comprised of fun face climbing next to a wide crack that is initially steep but quickly relents. The second pitch is on the shady side and is more of a boulder problem. Avoid the leftward traverse and boulder straight up the face on stellar moves. Of course you should do the route a second time to do the leftward traverse just for the cowboy move onto the arete. Many variations exist on the pinnacle.","protection":"A decent mix of passive and active pro, nothing extreme on either end will get you up the route. make sure you take webbing for the rap just in case.","location":"Indian Creek area, near the mouth of Powell Branch.
