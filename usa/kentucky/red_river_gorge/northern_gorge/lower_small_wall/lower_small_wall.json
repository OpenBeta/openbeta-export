At the very least, wear pants and long sleeves.\n\nThe climbing is decent but not amazing.  The route finding after the first pitch was very confusing.  After climbing a crack in decent left-facing dihedral on the first pitch, you arrive at a large ledge under a giant overhang.  Moving up and left and traversing around a bulge gets you to another large ledge.  Where the route goes from there is anybody's guess.
