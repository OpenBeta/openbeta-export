In fact it is pretty cool, not your typical RRG type roof but more of a Gunks kind of problem. Geezer, it really shouldnt be too hard to spot. Directly above the crack that forms the first pitch you will see a flake that is somewhat detached from the roof above. Haul your ass up on to that flake and sit astride it in a kind of mambo? stance. You know what I mean, leaning way back, cause the roof will be right in your face. Reach way out to the lip and you will find a great hold, and best of all a bomber tricam (1.5 or maybe a 2) placement in a vertical crack (slotted, not cammed). Screw up your courage, pull the roof, and KEEP YOUR %#^ TOGETHER because its kinda run out on 5.10 face above. Its way exhilarating, and not nearly so hard as Insanity Ceiling. Together with the stupendous first pitch (The Corner, 5.9) it is truly one of the best old school climbs in the Gorge. I am really not trying to sandbag anyone. The first pitch starts out somewhat ugly and strange, then becomes beautiful beyond belief. Then there is the matter of the runout above the roof.
