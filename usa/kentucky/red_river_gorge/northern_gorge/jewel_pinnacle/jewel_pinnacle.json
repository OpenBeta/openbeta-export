It is a distinct spire on the south side of the river. The route follows the crack that goes just right of the cat's nose and then between it's eyes to the summit. (NE side)\n\nAt the base of the pinnacle you'll know the route when you find the steep dihedral that seems to go all the way to the top.\n\nThe ultimate crux of the route is the mid section of the thankfully short first pitch. If it were cleaner the first pitch would be much cooler.\n\nThe intermediate belay is on a comfy ledge, but you can build a nice gear anchor in a horizontal and \"hang\" on it.\n\nYou'll need a #4 or #4.5 camalot for the start of the second pitch but other than that the gear is mostly mid sizes. Just bring plenty of duplicates.\n\nYou can rap from the goofy anchors of scramble down to the southwest and then rap from the vegetated ledge off to the east. Beware of copperheads near the rap.\n\nThere are now bolted anchors at the top of this climb that will get you all the way down with a 60M or 70M.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"B6TOSxPGVvGc/ObdVVW3IQ==","name":"Copperhead","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.61244,37.83208]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105869356","mp_crag_id":"105869064","climb_id":"B6TOSxPGVvGc/ObdVVW3IQ==","areaRef":"LtdjvxrEUFmYA/MfcJHgfA=="},"content":{"description":"This route ascends a face, to a short veritcal crack and then a low angle flake to a ledge.\n\nThe name is apt.
