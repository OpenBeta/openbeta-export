Protection is as available as you can hang on to place it. The climb starts at the back of a round cave and works out a handcrack past a big nose, climbing out and slightly downwards to the apex of a roof, where the lip is turned (crux) into a crack and a left-facing corner.  The crack over the lip was once filled with dirt but has been excavated and now takes jams and locks.","protection":"Cams from 1\"-3\"","location":"The route is toward the right hand end of Symphony Wall, starting back on a ledge in a cave. It is most easily recognized by the 4-foot tall \"nose\" of rock dangling down from the left side of the handcrack piercing the roof.

The route would go free and the rock is not too low in quality to climb. The climb also does not turn into an \"aidfest\" to get to the top.  To the contrary, I think it needs some minor cleaning and would go free without a major problem or effort. I suspect it would be 5.10+ or 5.11. Not a big deal for any good trad climber. There is some poor rock along this that should be cleaned though.\n\nThis was the very last rock I ever touched in the red before my departure in 1995, and the fact of the matter is that I got out from underneath the roof in a massive and sudden downpour- the reason for not finishing the route free was as simple as that. It was raining and so I sat down on a piece of gear, hauled up a raincoat, then began the task of lowering off, leaving one hex (#8 or #9?) behind.\n\nClimb up under a roof and then outward under the roof to transition to a wall on the left side in a scrunch problem.  The moves get gradually more difficult until you are out from under the roof.\n\nThe route is named after Jerry Bargo in honor of the fact that he had more or less pointed out all of the unclimbed stuff in that area to us, including Willie's Wall, Jazz Rock (you know, Jas' Rock), and this wall.","protection":"A standard light rack- it's hardly traveled, so heads up.","location":"Not far left of Boogered is the only other obvious roof and crack problem.
