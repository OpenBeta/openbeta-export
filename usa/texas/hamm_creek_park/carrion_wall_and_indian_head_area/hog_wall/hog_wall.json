It has been said that a grade of 5.12 is too high- that's fair. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and your mileage may vary.It has also been said that this climb should only have been a boulder problem and should never have been bolted. Well, as with all the climbs in this area, significant effort (e.g. brushing, de-flaking, and even removal of a tree sapling growing from the juggy pocket) was required to develop this route. All of this was done on top rope, so this route would not be the climb it is today by bouldering alone.If you choose to try it as a boulder problem, use a pad and spotter, and be confident!  Have a plan for getting home safely in the event of an injury (e.g. a good crew, first aid supplies, etc).","protection":"2 bolts and lower-off hooks","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"Gx2j8RLbW4e3eikaWwxOUw==","name":"Going HAMM","yds":"5.11+","grades":{"yds":"5.11+","french":"7a"},"fa":"Jim Day","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.46615,32.17428]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"121865403","mp_crag_id":"121225316","climb_id":"Gx2j8RLbW4e3eikaWwxOUw==","areaRef":"0rmyFJWdUsabrO/5Pzqb1w=="},"content":{"description":"Roof start.  The crux is getting onto the face.  Easy middle section, then another hard move on thin holds for the topout","protection":"4 bolts, ring and quicklink for top anchors","location":"Far right side of hog wall, before the powdery drop off"},"__v":0},{"_id":"NF3hGtkDXDOT6dHwi4djWw==","name":"Frosted Flakes","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Jim Day","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.46615,32.17428]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"121226716","mp_crag_id":"121225316","climb_id":"NF3hGtkDXDOT6dHwi4djWw==","areaRef":"0rmyFJWdUsabrO/5Pzqb1w=="},"content":{"description":"Slab start with a bulgey high heel topout","protection":"3 bolts, two bolts for top anchors (no permanent hardware- clean from top)","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"zRHHysPWV5+B0/ZTymta6g==","name":"Flake and Break","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Jim Day","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.46615,32.17428]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"121226675","mp_crag_id":"121225316","climb_id":"zRHHysPWV5+B0/ZTymta6g==","areaRef":"0rmyFJWdUsabrO/5Pzqb1w=="},"content":{"description":"Slabby start on thin feet and crimps with a crimpy finish.  Follow the bolt line for a harder topout or traverse left for an easier way","protection":"3 bolts, two bolts for top anchors (no permanent hardware- clean from top)","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"gpEBe1F9VQaaZ8uHQigQ9Q==","name":"Fish Flakes","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Jim Day","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.46615,32.17428]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"121226691","mp_crag_id":"121225316","climb_id":"gpEBe1F9VQaaZ8uHQigQ9Q==","areaRef":"0rmyFJWdUsabrO/5Pzqb1w=="},"content":{"description":"Slab start with a bulgey, juggy topout","protection":"3 bolts, two bolts for top anchors (no permanent hardware- clean from top)","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"VOpqao6TX4+s1EFdcqEMXQ==","name":"Eggs and Flakey","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"Jim Day","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.46615,32.17428]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"121226730","mp_crag_id":"121225316","climb_id":"VOpqao6TX4+s1EFdcqEMXQ==","areaRef":"0rmyFJWdUsabrO/5Pzqb1w=="},"content":{"description":"Starts with a low juggy pocket, then nothing but thin flakey crimps and jibs til the top","protection":"3 bolts, two bolts for top anchors (no permanent hardware- clean from top)","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,5d751a33-b886-5e67-a9ea-ef1e2278bd5f,649fb80a-7767-5791-ba58-101dab480aea,d2b9b214-959d-52c6-9bac-eff93f3a9bd7","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Hamm Creek Park","Carrion Wall and Indian Head area","Hog Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":6,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":3,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":3,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.46615,32.17428]},"bbox":[-97.46668124176388,32.173830339818146,-97.46561875823612,32.174729660181875],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121225316","area_id":"0rmyFJWdUsabrO/5Pzqb1w=="},"content":{"description":"Section of wall to the left of Indian Head/ Carrion Wall.
