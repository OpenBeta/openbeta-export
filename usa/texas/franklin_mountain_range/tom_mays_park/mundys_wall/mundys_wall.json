Strenuous.","protection":"Toprope, 2 chains.  Leading is not recommended due to a few scratchy footholds that need cleaning and 1 loose handhold, as well as relatively poor pro while getting under the offwidth bulge.  Pro in the crack is okay, a large offwidth cam could protect the layback.","location":"Just left of the bolted line, follow the natural weakness to the back of a deep stemming corner.
