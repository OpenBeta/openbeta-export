The lower areas we checked out we're pretty loose, so we hiked north and climbed 2 or 3 short pitches ending in a brushy bowl below the east face (there are several moist, moss-filled caves people have clearly camped in over the years). From the caves area, we traversed left/south to gain the east ridge again. This is where the best climbing starts. It's fairly easy, but quite exposed at times.
