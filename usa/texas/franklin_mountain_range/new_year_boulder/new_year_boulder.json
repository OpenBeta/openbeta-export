Here's a new boulder for a new year!\n\n A small limestone boulder located right off the popular Thousand Steps Trail in Franklin Mountains State Park. The rock quality is better than most of the stuff at Crazy Cat. There are a couple worthwhile problems and potential eliminates & variations for when you don't have a reservation or tour at Hueco and you've run out of stuff to do at Crazy Cat. The V0s would be very good for someone new to bouldering outside. We're guessing some or all of the lines had been climbed before. If anyone knows of older ascents or problem names, I'd be happy to fix it. We first climbed here on January 1, 2021. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:09.043Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:56.547Z"}
