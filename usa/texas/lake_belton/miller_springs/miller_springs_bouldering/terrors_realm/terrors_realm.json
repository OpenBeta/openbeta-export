There could be some easy climbs on the far left and far right sides of this wall, but in the main section there's gonna be hard, thin climbs. Definitely potential for some hard hard mono climbs with sketchy dirty topouts This is obviously a local party spot, if the litter and trash is any indication. FYI there was a large beehive on the far left side of this wall, there were no bees but it looked scary af"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:08.479Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:55.682Z"}
