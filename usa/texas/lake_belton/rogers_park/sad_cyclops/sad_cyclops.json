Look for the Sad Cyclops wall, a new area that hasn't seen much traffic. Typical of rogers, shady, and lots of fun.   -A Sad and Lonely Cyclops-   I'm a sad and lonely Cyclops.   I am so misunderstood.   Though I probably look fearsome   I am actually good.   I'm as harmless as a kitten.   No, I wouldn't hurt a fly,   But my neighbors think I'm monstrous   with my solitary eye.   So they laugh at me and tease me   and they often call me names,   plus they won't let me participate   in their Olympic games.   They won't let me join their practices   or even watch a tryout.   So I sit at home and sniffle   and I sadly cry my eye out.   --Kenn Nesbitt"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:08.474Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:11.333Z"}
