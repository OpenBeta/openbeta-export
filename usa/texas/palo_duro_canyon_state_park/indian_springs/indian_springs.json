The rock quality of this route is superb. (until the very top at least). The crack ranges from big hands to off width and is an excellent test piece for a variety of crack climbing skills.  \n\n  Access the lower ramp by either climbing straight up the leftmost crack, or start on the right and traverse over. Continue up the crack in the dihedral to the top. At the top, either top out by climbing the choss straight up, or traverse right. \n\n  Perhaps the best option would be to pre-rig an anchor by throwing some webbing over the huge block so that you could avoid topping out.    Another anchor option is to use the tree located far right of the climb. This works, though the follower would experience quite a swing.","protection":"Big cams to #5 Doubles sew it up nicely.

I pulled a 1'x3'x5\" chuck of rock off on my first move on another route on this wall.  Most holds are fine but just keep a heads up. \n\n  The crack to the right is easier than the face.  You can climb the entire crack and it's still a fun climb. Or if you want a challenge, follow the route straight up rather than veering to the right.  Lots of potential for variations on this route.","protection":"I just set up a top rope on a tree right above the route.  The tree is about 15' from the ledge so bring plenty of webbing.
