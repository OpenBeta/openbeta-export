As with all rock in the canyon, the cliff varies in quality from absolute choss to decent sandstone. A good rule of thumb here is the darker the rock, the more solid (grey and orange/rust colored stuff is pretty trustworthy, the cream colored stuff will explode to dust in your hands).    There are many mesquite trees atop the cliff to build anchors on, just make sure to bring plenty of webbing! (50ft+) \n\n  DONT CLIMB HERE AFTER IT RAINS   I'd say to wait at least 3 days if not longer.  \n\n  MAKE SURE YOUR ANCHORS HANG OVER THE CLIFF'S EDGE AND THAT YOUR ROPE DOESN\"T RUN AGAINST THE ROCK   even the good rock here is pretty soft."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:09.670Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:13.002Z"}
