Note, a fall off the start could pull you and your belayer off the ledge so it is a good idea to set up a belay anchor. The 5.9 grading is pretty stiff and should not be taken lightly. Though the rock here is pretty solid it is still soft sandstone and a fall could very likely pull gear. Make sure you are very confident at the grade before attempting.
