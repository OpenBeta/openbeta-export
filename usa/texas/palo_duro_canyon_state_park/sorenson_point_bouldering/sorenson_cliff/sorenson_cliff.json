Many short vertical cracks exist and should make for a fun day. Last time I was up there, there was a ~30ft traverse using many pockets with a lot of chalk on it.    As the cliff is located directly above a slope, spotting may be difficult in places.  \n\n  Please add any specific routes if you know them, and if there is a different name for this area please let me know."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:07.834Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:44.063Z"}
