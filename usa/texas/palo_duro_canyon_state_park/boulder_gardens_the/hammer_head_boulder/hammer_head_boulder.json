It is nestled at the bottom of the valley/wash gully near a project highball. \n\n  The boulder is easy and fun which is hard to come by in the canyon. It is really worth going to if you are in a group that is headed to the Mushroom boulder. The rock quality is very gritty and the climb has pockets, crimps and slopers that are of very good quality."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:10.240Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:57.981Z"}
