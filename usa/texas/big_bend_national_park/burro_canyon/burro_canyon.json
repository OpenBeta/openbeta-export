Listed below are the five areas that have established climbs.The following areas can be accessed by continuing to walk into the Burro Canyon. They are listed in order of appearance when walking from the river.The first area \"Mini Burro\" consists of very easy V0-V1 climbing on large holds. Caution should be used when climbing here since the cracks are deep and may be home to local spiders or scorpions.Mini Burro has a 40ft traverse and multiple V0 and V1 climbs. The vertical routes are approximately 15ft tall and are about 4-6 moves when sit starting.The second area \"Balance\" is a medium sized boulder that is balanced on two rocks and leaning on a third. This area has one over hanging boulder with four routes on it with more possible routes on the back side. This area has more than four routes but is home to V0-V8. The V8 is still an open project since the feet on the start are difficult to sus out and require some very skilled foot pressing to get off the ground. The V0 is located on the small boulder to the \"right\" that sits on the ground.The third area \"Easter bunny\" is a medium sized boulder with more potential but is home to one V3.The fourth area \"Droplet Boulder\" is home to four routes, a V4 sit start along the arete, a V1 slab along the main slab face, a V3 sit on the left arete/face (difficult sit start but good holds after). Potential for additional climbs on the slab face.The fifth area \"Burro\" is a small/medium boulder with two routes. One V4 sit start into slab climbing and one V0+ stand start. Potential for more climbs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":12,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:04.745Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:07.414Z"}
