Most of the climb will be jugs or crimps but sometimes an occasional sloper. Feet are very good on this climb, for reference I was able to do this in running shoes. Be VERY careful when moving up the rock, a lot of the hand holds broke off when I was climbing, so double check every hold before lifting your weight on them.
