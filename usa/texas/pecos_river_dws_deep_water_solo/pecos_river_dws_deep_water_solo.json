Solid, overhanging limestone, into water that is approx 20' deep. You can do additional depth checks if you want... Very secluded, with the exception of the occasional border patrol guard. Don't worry, they are friendly, and will help you if you are in danger for whatever reason.    The best routes are overhanging and are approx. 30 - 50' high. We climbed them in the rain, and the holds were still dry. From there, you can head further up river to find several new and untapped DWS routes. It did get windy at times on the river, which makes it challenging to keep the boat near your climber...
