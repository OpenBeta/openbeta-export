Start with your back against the right side of the crack and make your way up using chimney technique and good feet until you can reach the crack where the two boulders converge. Here you will find bomb hand/fist jams which allow you to adjust your body position 180 degrees in order to  climb the second half of the problem in a chimney fashion and ultimately reach the hueco undercling that will help you top out to the left. The problem can be sent using minimal crack technique if you so desire, but I think employing chimney/jam techniques makes this problem a hell of a lot more fun! ","protection":"Crash pad","location":" "},"__v":0},{"_id":"fTNtZFjFVN+F8kaCMuObwQ==","name":"Classic","yds":"V0","grades":{"yds":"V0","font":"4","vscale":"V0"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.78626,30.36603]},"left_right_index":18,"mp_id":"109214629","mp_crag_id":"106141738","climb_id":"fTNtZFjFVN+F8kaCMuObwQ==","areaRef":"Nc2fFLpLXKWqOMAbdtBLag=="},"content":{"description":"Stand start on good pockets and continue to climb on good pockets to the right of the arch/crescent shaped-hold (just to the right and off-center of the boulder) up to the top.
