The left has a juggy pocket that you can reach up to for a quick and easy top out. The slight dihedral in the middle of the face is a bit more challenging. For a real challenge, stay off the top ledge until you reach the high right point. Avoid spider webs, the small tree, and keep feet off of Boulder 3.
