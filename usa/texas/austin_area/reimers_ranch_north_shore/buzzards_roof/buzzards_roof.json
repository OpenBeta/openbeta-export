Route goes up the center of the wall pulling the roof on protruding rock along the lip. Wingspan starts with a scramble up to the base of the triangle-shaped boulder. Play with the roof a bit and try not to think about the boulder underneath you. Burly moves get you past the lip and a thin finish on the mini-wave earns the anchors. Don't z-clip the 2nd bolt.  \n\n  Belayer should stand down and to the right just under bolt 1 to minimize rope issues at the start. \n\n  R rating due to possible bad landing on boulder. Have a good belayer and a cool head @ bolt 4 and you'll be fine. Do not toprope this route. A bad fall onto the pointed boulder below can (did) happen. \n\n  During development while working the roof section my right hand popped out of the slot causing me to take a grounder onto the slanted boulder below. I struck at just the right angle as to not incur any injuries but I wouldn't say by any means that the feat is repeatable. DON'T TOP ROPE THIS ROUTE.","protection":"4 bolts.

Also some vegetation is hiding good features. Some pencil cactus is on the route so watch out for that too. \n\n  I would consider the last moves to the trees the crux based on awkwardness, so get really good protection in before that. A fall while trying to reach the trees would be very shitty. Don't do it. There are some very nice crimps around and pre-plan where you are putting your feet. You are on a great ledge before the this so you have plenty of time to look and feel around before committing to anything. \n\n  Still requires some cleaning. \n\n  Reimer's Ranch does not have enough traditional routes.","protection":"Small cams such as a set of black through red aliens plus a few C4s such as 0.5 - 1 and some small to medium nuts is a good start.
