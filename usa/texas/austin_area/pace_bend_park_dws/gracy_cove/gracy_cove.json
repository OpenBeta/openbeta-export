A bit of a hike down to the water's edge, and then there are typical Austin Limestone ledges on either side of the inlet. Plenty of good boulder problems and you could potentially climb and top out above. Set a top-rope on the granite slabs above and you've got some excellent climbs in the 5.6-5.10 range due to multiple nice roof features."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:01.995Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:50.585Z"}
