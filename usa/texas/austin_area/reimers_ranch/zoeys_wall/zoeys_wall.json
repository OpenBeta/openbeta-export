Around the corner from Bulginator. The guidebook description is a little confusing and can have you thinking Bulginator is Sunny Fun.\n\n The good thing is that most who come here don't seem to know this route exists, and it currently is not polished at all. The crux is the start.\n\n The bad: tree branches will scratch your back as you lower. A 5.9 variation exists on the arete to the left and using only holds left of the bolt line, but overhanging brush usually covers this variation and makes it not worth trying. But if you find the right conditions (I have once, and the 5.9 is good, with the spice down low where you don't want to fall), it's worth it.\n\n Note: the guidebook grade for this route is 5.7, but most think the start feels harder than that. I've given a suggested 5.8 and have heard others make a reasonable claim that it is 5.9.
