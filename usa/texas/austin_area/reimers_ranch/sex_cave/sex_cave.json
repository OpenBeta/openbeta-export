The sling should be long enough to allow the climber to get into the rest without weighting the sling. When the climber has gone in direct the first belayer should go off belay and either the climber should pull the rope down so that the 2nd belayer can reach it and put him on belay, or the 2nd belayer can snag the rope with a stick clip and pull it down. Once the second belayer is on belay (rope should, at this point, be only going from the climber through the first and possibly 2nd headwall bolts of 38 special and down to the second belayer) the climber can remove the long sling and recover at the rest for however long he needs before finishing the 2nd pitch."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,41721d21-e3c7-5dfd-81c9-00c8f5de787b,476399d5-2675-54ba-ba9b-133697513af2,9c223116-8605-5af7-baff-48509bdb4942","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Austin Area","Reimers Ranch","Sex Cave"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13b"},{"count":3,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":1,"label":"V2"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13d"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":14,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":9,"expert":5}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":9,"expert":5}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.1237,30.3631]},"bbox":[-98.12422114007236,30.36265033981814,-98.12317885992765,30.363549660181867],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105842294","area_id":"nCIxFoYFWve6/0hQm9tJQg=="},"content":{"description":"Great looking cave at the entrance to the ranch.
