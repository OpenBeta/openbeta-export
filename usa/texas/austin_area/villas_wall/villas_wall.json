Match the left foot next to the right on the ledge and start the traverse from there using whatever crimps and footholds you can find. Move to the right all the way to the other side of the wall.

It will be pretty crowded during the day since the wall is on the sidewalk of Nueces Street right in the heart of west campus. Thanks to a bright street lamp located right next to the wall, climbing this at night would probably be ideal. The wall is very well lit and there will be fewer people walking by to bother you. The wall is decked with many tiny crimps that double as decent footholds along with a few full pad crimps and side pulls (plus one random mono that for now has no good purpose). There are several tree-shaded benches to sit on while resting but there won't be much shade on the wall itself if you decide to climb between noon and sunset."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:24:59.437Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:09.602Z"}
