So on July 19 I led Black Slabbath and set some directionals to facilitate TRing this \"new\" route.\n\n On September 22, I went back and led it trad. Because the placements were sketchy and there were fewer than I thought there'd be, I will not describe them or recommend gear. Basically, I led it trad just in case I really did do the FA and someone came along and said it didn't count because it was on TR.\n\n To anchor, I crossed over to the Black Slabbath anchors and placed a cam and a hex along the way to protect that short, easy traverse. While I have used that rock before for directionals and have rapped off such placements, that time I found that the rock there has gone from questionable to terrible, and I even trundled some large pieces. However, there is still okay rock if you look for it.\n\n If there is a party on BS, you will need to go up into the brush to find solid trees for anchors; the rock around the topout is not sufficient for building a safe anchor. You can TR this off the BS anchors, but a fall will mean a big swing left, possibly crashing into a climber or rope on Die Easy just  left of BS. So basically don't climb this route unless DE and BS are unoccupied or you are willing and equipped to lead the route and then crash through brush.\n\n My 5.6 is based on not using the fallen tree to start and on pulling onto the ledge just above where the anchors likely would be were this a sport route. Otherwise, this is maybe 5.4.\n\n As to the name-- there has been a recent fervor in the Austin climbing community to rename \"offensive\" route names. My name for the route is a poke in their collective woke eyes.

I originally listed the route as 5.8 as it is in the local guidebook, but that's a little confusing because the start is the crux and that start is also the crux of a 5.9 line. No, there's not a huge difference in those grades, but it's still a little confusing. The route has a PG rating because of the second clip and the easy runout between the third and fourth clips. The route: clip the first two bolts of the Mongrel (don't use the skinny tree if you want the 5.8 or 5.9) and then traverse left and clip Hollywood's second bolt. Traverse left and then climb Roo Dog's third and fourth bolts; climb to the anchors and clip the left anchor. Head up and left and clip Butt Scratch's left anchor. Finally, go up and left again and clip the anchors of It's a Wiggle Butt, and lower. Those anchors are easily distinguished because they are the highest on the wall.The crux is the start. The climbing on Roo Dog is 5.7/5.8, and all the rest is easy and fun.","protection":"5 quickdraws. You might want a couple longer slings to reduce drag, but I haven't had any real drag problems with just standard-length draws. \n\n  With a 40m rope, I had about 18' left over, so a 35 might just work, but a 30 will not.","location":"The Mongrel is the third bolted route from the right end of Seismic Wall.
