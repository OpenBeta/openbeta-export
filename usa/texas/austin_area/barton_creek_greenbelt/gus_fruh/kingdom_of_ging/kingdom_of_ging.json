Make the huge move from the crimps out to the triangular jutting jug.

It moves into a jug / pocket, directly behind you (going out of the cave), into another jug to your left side.  There will be one more jug, directly center, that you will move to before you reach to a deep 2-3 finger pocket out to the left.  With some footwork, move out to the right to a 3 finger half crimp and up to the jugs above, traversing slightly up and to the right. It finishes directly under Charlie Don't Surf. \n\n  Good: Holds are very good for the first half of the route, but with limited feet / tricky sequencing, the first half of the route can feel awkward.   \n\n  Bad: The deep 2-3 finger pocket.  Somewhat sharp, pulling off the pocket can shred some serious skin.  The problem is completely overhung, so figuring out your beta and moving quickly will help. \n\n  Crux: Moving from the pocket to the half crimp.  The key is using either a heel hook or toe hook & drop knee to crank up to the crimp.  Body tension should be your focus.","protection":"Pads, spotters","location":"Kingdom of Ging, directly centerline."},"__v":0},{"_id":"axm6GMB+X12T8nMXO5dNIw==","name":"Hank's B8 Extension","yds":"5.12d","grades":{"yds":"5.12d","french":"7c"},"fa":"Unknown FA","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-97.79696,30.25077]},"left_right_index":5,"mp_id":"118332489","mp_crag_id":"106097124","climb_id":"axm6GMB+X12T8nMXO5dNIw==","areaRef":"vK9y0WFlX6ayr7X77RqxCw=="},"content":{"description":"Ultimate sit start to Charlie Don't Surf, all the way at the back of the cave.

A quirky, fully different lead variation right of all the moves on Gray Streak: welcome to Black Streak. Stay right and don’t touch any of the handholds from Gray Streak, including the ledge entry start. Basically, climb the black colored streak. Mind the possible PG rating if you fall on lead as you’ll have a hefty pendulum swing. I definitely dialed in the beta on toprope before attempting the lead because it’s probably not worth falling. ABOUT THE GRADING: after dialing in the beta solid, the crux from bolt 1 to bolt 2 still feels harder than any one move on Gray Streak (my friend Amy agrees) or King of Ging, but maybe no harder than Charlie Don’t Surf.  So I went with 10c (same as Gray Steak). I’m pretty sure it’s height/reach dependent though (I'm 5'8, 0 wingspan) so I can see taller people maybe thinking it’s 10a or 10b, but let me know what you think and have fun!-Vincevideo: youtube.com/watch?v=w4o9Dya…;","protection":"4 bolts.
