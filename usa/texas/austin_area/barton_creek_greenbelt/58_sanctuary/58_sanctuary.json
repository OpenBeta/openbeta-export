It's not really a route for anyone except a trad climber desperate to place gear in an area swarming with bolts. The rock is weak, some of the placements are questionable, and the top-out and belay are a mess. But for some reason, I've done this route twice now, lol. And it provides an opportunity to use a coveted Black Totem if you have one!\n\n The finish is brushy and dirty, and then you have to fight through brush to set up a belay off trees. Lots of fun. Fortunately, you can lower your second and then crash through a little more brush to reach a trail that takes you back down.\n\n Although my two ascents in the spring of 2018 are the only two lead ascents of which I know, I'm not claiming an FA on this because someone had probably at least free soloed it already. But if I ever find out I did do the FA, then I might name it \"Really Pointless Wonder.\"\n\n My 5.6 rating is an estimate; I can see reasonable people calling it either 5.5 or 5.7.","protection":"Small and medium cams, stoppers, cord for tree anchors.","location":"Park at the 360 Loop access and hike down to Seismic Wall.
