A little chossy, and the topouts are full of loose rock, but there are some fun climbs here from V0 and up. Scouted by Jeff Jackson back in the day; he gives one of the V0 climbs a * in his book, and that book doesn't give out stars easily. The same book gives Reach Problem at Rogers one * and people consider Reach to be a centex classic."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:01.093Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:04.649Z"}
