Squeeze your way out 36 feet of roof climbing with the landing never being more than 5 feet behind you. Halfway through you will encounter the infamous Devil's Butthole, a dark, vast hole that easily fits six grown men inside of it (possibly more?). Venture in as far as you dare, but according to Verm, \"flashlights are off route.\" \n\n  At the butthole you have two options - either crawl in for a rest, a game of cards, or possibly a cup of coffee, or, bypass the butthole and grit your way around the rim, continuing upwards leaving the darkness behind. Work your way towards the light and finish on the slab above. \n\n  With a little bit of everything, from jugs to pinches and kneebars to heel hooks this one is guaranteed to not leave a bad taste in your mouth.","protection":"Buttloads of crashpads","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,457ea224-0d15-5f68-9d1e-2a153b89bc3b,bd464288-c6a9-58a8-9569-a237a2b00b48,0905aba9-2bc9-514f-a90f-7cfe8b3787a3","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Hueco Tanks","West Mountain","Devil's Butthole, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.04949,31.91363]},"bbox":[-106.05001973119515,31.91318033981814,-106.04896026880485,31.91407966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111545320","area_id":"CQWrqSvJUU+pD3z+izeHow==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.05001973119515,31.91318033981814],[-106.04896026880485,31.91318033981814],[-106.04896026880485,31.91407966018187],[-106.05001973119515,31.91407966018187],[-106.05001973119515,31.91318033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"A dark, well concealed area on the frontside of West."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:00.591Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:11.890Z"}
