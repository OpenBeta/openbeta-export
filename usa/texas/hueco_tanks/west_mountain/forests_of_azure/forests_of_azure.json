One of the finest Hueco climbs.\"  Before we had bolted caves in abundance, there was The Secret Sharer. Not really a cave, but that steep with a line of huecos and then fingerbuckets at the top. Most of today's caves are not the caliber of rock found on The Secret Sharer.","protection":"Four bolts up to a double bolt anchor.  The protection bolts are old and have to catch real falls.  Good risk managment might be to dog it into familiarity and then do it in headpoint/the-leader-never-falls style. I thought getting a top-rope on it was not practical. The Secret Sharer is so steep that even top-rope sessions need the protection bolts to dampen the harsh swing.  So the bolts get yarded on weather you dog/flash or TR.  \n\n  I can think of no other route I'd rather replace the bolts on.  This fall a ranger commented about how trusting Hueco's bolts seemed crazyish.  So I asked him if I could replace some this winter, thinking of Secret Sharer.  He said Austin was working on a system for bolting. \n\n  The old beta was a #8 hex in a hole to protect getting to the first bolt...that's the \"r\" part.  A Camalot would probably work much better.  The third bolt is a hairy clip, better hold above.  Bring the stick-clip too.","location":"I imagine that this is now easy to find because a volunteer guide is required.  After crossing the dam, stay at pit level for about 1/4 mile, until past the huge Pit Roof and around a boulder. Then head into the rocks.  This route is not much above pit level."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,457ea224-0d15-5f68-9d1e-2a153b89bc3b,bd464288-c6a9-58a8-9569-a237a2b00b48,cee5a0db-5c04-5840-90c7-612da32dfeac","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Hueco Tanks","West Mountain","Forests of Azure"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.0456,31.9129]},"bbox":[-106.04612972699196,31.91245033981814,-106.04507027300804,31.91334966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106316067","area_id":"zuWg21wEWECQx2Etoy3+rA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.04612972699196,31.91245033981814],[-106.04507027300804,31.91245033981814],[-106.04507027300804,31.91334966018187],[-106.04612972699196,31.91334966018187],[-106.04612972699196,31.91245033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the jumble of rocks on the north side of West Mountain.
