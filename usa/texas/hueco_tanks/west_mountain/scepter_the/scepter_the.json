The business is in the first 25/30 feet, and I'm not really sure how to rate it. As a boulder problem, sheer terror might add a V grade or two, so it could be as \"easy\" as V7 or as hard as V10. \n\n  I did Chewbacca as a ground-up boulder problem, over two days, with crashpads and spotters. At one point, I climbed the easier (V3) corner to the right as a boulder/solo, to look at the lip holds and suss the top on Chewbacca, but that was the only pre-inspection. \n\n  The upper slab on both problems seemed to be 5.9/10 and went for another 20 or 30 feet, so don't fall up there. The wall is not radically overhanging, so I'm sure a good toprope could be arranged.","protection":"I used two crashpads, but the more, the merrier! Could also be safely toproped, I'm sure.
