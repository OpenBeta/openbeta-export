The physical crux is right at the 1st (2 bolts). The pump factor continues for (3 more) spaced out bolts to the headwall. Get ready to have your psyche melted on the 11d(ha!) headwall (2 more bolts). The list of radsters that blew the final headwall is staggeringly awesome.  \n\n  Try to imagine, the steepest wall with the most shallow huecos ever, slopetastic! 20'-30' falls are lobbed here regularly, in particular due to the belayer not being able to see or hear the leader for a bit of the last part of the climb.","protection":"7 bolts and a 2 bolt anchor. For the last hair raising part of the climb, the belayer connot see the climber. Safe but long fall potential there.","location":"If you can find the Eagle, Legends is quite obvious. Start behind a large boulder with a bird poop cap on it. Clip 2 bolts, dyno and start pumping up and right. No getting lost here. Wiring the final headwall on TR is easy and so is the descent.
