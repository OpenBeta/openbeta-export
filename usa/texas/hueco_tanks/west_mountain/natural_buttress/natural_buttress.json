A 3.5 friend protects the move to clip the 2nd bolt halfway up...\"  I think of the first half as the funky appoach and the upper half as six bolts protecting vertical-plus, sustained, 5.10 \"finger-buckets\" on great rock. (Piana quote again).  \n\n  Not the best belay zone, but one can get in a sunny pitch here two-plus hours before the Frontside gets radiated.  \n\n  I plan to use the guide system for Max Headroom and get a photo before 2009.","protection":"I'd bring the #1,2,3,4 Camalots and some slings to keep it straight.","location":"Walk at least 100 meters past the east end of the dam, until below the buttress.
