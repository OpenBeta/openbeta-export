Took much cleaning and is not the best rock quality,  but the line is obvious and the holds that are there are quality.   \n\n  Begins low down on a sloper and does a move to a good right hand sidepull and do a large lunged to a good hueco cut jug.  Match and cross to slopey hueco.  Heel toe cam in the jug and reach out and rigth to a crimpy undercling.  Rock over on your left foot and find a smearing right foot.  Pop into the undercling at the top of the juggy hueco and lunch out left for a slopey jug.  Easy top out.   \n\n  Two stars for the holds and movement.  Negative two for the death landing and crumbly rock although I'm sure this will clean up with traffic and time.  So a potential 3-star line that as of the time of this posting hasn't had a 2nd Ascent.","protection":"Two pads, two spotters.
