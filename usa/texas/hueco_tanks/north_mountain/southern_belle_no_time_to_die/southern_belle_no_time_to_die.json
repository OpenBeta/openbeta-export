Climb up the center of the face. The crux is throwing for the jug, which is as scary as it is hard. From there continue straight up and then slightly left at the top. The moves after the jug are still hard, so make sure you have enough pads and spotters. I gave the star rating 3, but Its really up to you to decide what you think it is. Same goes for the grade, It may be harder than V6. Be careful with the tree! Please protect the plant-life. ","protection":"Minimum six pads, at least 2 spotters. Landing is not the best, and the boulder is a highball.","location":"-See beta photo or GPS-  Head towards lost boulders from pond parking. Continue by passing the right side of the lower lost cause boulders staying on the main trail. Continue straight and slightly left until you pass \"Blue feather\" area (a small group of boulders). Continue straight from there over uneven wavy landscape to the next group of boulders which should be the unknown area. Might take some searching, but I've added some photos of No Time to Die, which is easily recognizable.
