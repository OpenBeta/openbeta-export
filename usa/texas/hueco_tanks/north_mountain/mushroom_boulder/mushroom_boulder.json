Step up onto the crimp that you used with your right either with a toe or a heal and catch a bad hold at the lip and bump up to a better hold. There are several ways to work your hands up over the lip but ultimately you want to get onto 2 crimpy pinches about 3 feet over the lip and your foot up onto the good hold just below the lip, from here you can stand up and grab some higher holds and top out. \n\nLocation\n\n  Starts under the roof on the east side of the boulder of the jug at the end of the obvious flake/rail on the right side of the overhang.","protection":"Crash pad","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"ZMfNCQYNWLqvQE6YbHWuLQ==","name":"Local Flakes","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.0425,31.9217]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105810728","mp_crag_id":"105810700","climb_id":"ZMfNCQYNWLqvQE6YbHWuLQ==","areaRef":"+YmKWedsVfOabGBF7sA+cg=="},"content":{"description":"A classic V2.
