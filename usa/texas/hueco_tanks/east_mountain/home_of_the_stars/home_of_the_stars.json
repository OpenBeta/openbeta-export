Continue out on nice flake jugs untill you arrive at a couple of nice underclings. Get a knee scum to make a big move up to a sharp small crimp. Figure out how to use this to move left to another good hold at the bottom right of a huge depression, some foot trickery is required. Then traverse left along the base of the depression into teh corner which is followed to the top. Once you reach the corner the problem is pretty much over, you would have to try to fall off if you made it this far. \n\nThis is one of the best V6's anywhere. Fun movement, a good variety of hold types and moves. Long enough to not just be over. High enough to be somewhat commiting.","protection":"Pads and spotter. Several pads on this are a good idea as the problem covers a bit of ground and the spotter will not beable to spot and move pads at the same time.","location":"Start at the back right of the overhang with your feet on a vertical panel at the back."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,457ea224-0d15-5f68-9d1e-2a153b89bc3b,0becad0a-d695-57b6-9ee4-65cd875106b3,410c495a-6291-51a2-a51c-8efea0068e14","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Hueco Tanks","East Mountain","Home of the Stars"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.0391,31.9171]},"bbox":[-106.0396297511768,31.916650339818137,-106.03857024882319,31.917549660181862],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106536188","area_id":"QQxJWmKRUaKlHI7+oAaOFA=="},"content":{"description":"A single long steep overhang with a landing that follows it but is yet quite far away.
