These are past the low water crossing near 7A resort. The boulders we particularly climbed on are in a bunch of shrubbery of thorns and trees. The potential to tread climb on the cliffs behind these boulders also seem  like a lot of fun! These boulders are hard limestone and the cliffs are mix of hard and soft, brittle limestone.
