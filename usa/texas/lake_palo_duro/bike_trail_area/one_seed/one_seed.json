The landing slopes so a strap or something to secure the pads is helpful. The hardest moves are down low but an uncontrolled fall from the upper portion of the boulder could be ugly due to the close proximity of the tree and the large, jagged boulder on the left.","location":"On the downhill overhanging face. SDS with hands matched in the small hueco on the right hand side of the overhang. Make a move with the RH up to a flat hold just above, then initiate the aforementioned leftward sequence on crimps to get out from under the tree. Then climb straight up on more crimps."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,2f28b51a-ee97-55aa-a82d-f9e178caf334,c5c6cc22-e274-5a92-b9b6-2944b89ec6f1,da3068f3-463f-5f1d-9a6f-b4494c63def7","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Lake Palo Duro","Bike Trail Area","One Seed"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5-6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-101.15533,36.34082]},"bbox":[-101.15588823297821,36.34037033981814,-101.15477176702181,36.341269660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119173181","area_id":"2jBo80Y/Xx2ab7RJTGPe9w=="},"content":{"description":"This is a well hidden boulder due to the namesake Juniper tree growing next to it.
