This is one of the taller faces in the canyon and the landing slopes steeply downhill so creative pad placement and spotters would increase the safety factor. The uphill corner offers a good line with a much more forgiving landing. **Since this page was created the area around this boulder has been defaced by a church group/cult who excavated a bunch of dirt to create a spot for their rituals from the uphill side and dumped it on the downhill side, particularly on the slab where the sit start for Into the Woods is located. Everything is still climbable but the damage is a downer."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:07.841Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:19.349Z"}
