There is some questionable loose rock in the upper part as well so tread carefully. The large flake in the center of the wall can be used in a variety of ways but it's anyone's guess how solidly it's attached. Nonetheless, this is an attractive and challenging problem.","protection":"1-2 crashpads","location":"The start is sort of a hybrid sit/stand due to the steep angle and the fact that the bottom edge of the boulder doesn't touch the ground. Start with the RH on a shallow sidepull pocket and the LH in a good 2 finger pocket. Bump up to a good pocket, then use the large flake to link to a good hueco up and left. Once the hueco is latched the topout is straightforward."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,2f28b51a-ee97-55aa-a82d-f9e178caf334,c5c6cc22-e274-5a92-b9b6-2944b89ec6f1,2a763f9e-5f68-5dd2-a9c5-d33fd938c2da","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Lake Palo Duro","Bike Trail Area","Hidden Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5-"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-101.15507,36.33955]},"bbox":[-101.15562822387557,36.339100339818145,-101.15451177612441,36.33999966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118760910","area_id":"KnY/nl9oXdKpxdM/2TjC2g=="},"content":{"description":"This block features a stark, steeply overhanging face.
