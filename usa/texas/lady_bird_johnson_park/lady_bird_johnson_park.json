The rock here is very crumbly, mossy, and covered in a thin layer of dirt. There are some sections of the limestone bluff however where the rock is solid and promises a few short routes. Additionally there is at least one climbable boulder. With proper protection this area offers several overhangs and interesting climbing for locals who don't have the time to drive out to E-rock and are desperate to climb anything. As as of writing this, this area is completely undeveloped. Many boulders are strewn about, although they are in general too small to be interesting."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:07.826Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:43.645Z"}
