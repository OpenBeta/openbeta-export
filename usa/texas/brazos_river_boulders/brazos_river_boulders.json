The route I took went straight up the middle. At the start, there's a ledge to post up on. After a little hop to get up on the first foothold, the first 12-15 feet are very juggy - easy holds and plenty of feet space. About 15 feet up, the easy jugs run out, and you are left with a crack about 3 ft below the top. Place your fingers within the crack, and hike your right foot up and get a solid footing in the hold to your right. From here, you can lift up and grab the top, which is a high angle and easy to grab. Place your left foot in the small hold to the left, and use that to press up and top out. Climb down on the right side - but watch out for the thorns.\n\n Be warned with this route - it's a pretty high boulder, and the water below is only about 3 feet deep with rocks on either side. A fall could potentially be pretty brutal. It's jumpable if you absolutely need to - but I HIGHLY recommend topping out and walking down around the boulder.","protection":"3-4 feet of water below the slab.","location":"This slab is pretty obvious to see as you are kayaking along the Brazos river from the Rochelle's drop-off point. It's about a mile and a half up, and will be on your left right along the first bend.Â "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,4f4767a6-b408-58a3-b7fb-750f0a5e2129,ccaaa72e-fe88-58a2-a68e-6fbc7fe666e4","pathTokens":["USA","Texas","Brazos River Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1-2"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.28027,32.882]},"bbox":[-98.28080544330386,32.88155033981815,-98.27973455669616,32.88244966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117882984","area_id":"zKqnLv6IWKKmjm+8f+Zm5A=="},"content":{"description":"Secluded, easy shallow-water boulders along the Brazos River near Graford, TX.
