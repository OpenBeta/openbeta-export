The rock is the remanence of a house built on an unsafe cliff which fell into the lake. The area is pretty popular as boats come by constantly to show their buddies “that’s where the house fell into the lake on the news”. That said you’ll rarely ever find climbers out there just a few cliff divers like the rest of lake Whitney."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:07.829Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:10.668Z"}
