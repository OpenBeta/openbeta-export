The rock wall area between Buda and Metro Walls, this area provides a nice, shaded area in the summer for learning and mostly easier climbs.  This section of rock has a prominent ledge that runs across the wall around 2/3rds height all the way from COVID Corner to Estilio de Tigre breaking most climbs into 2 sections.  This area will provide a great place to introduce new climbers to many needed skills."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:09.054Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:12.443Z"}
