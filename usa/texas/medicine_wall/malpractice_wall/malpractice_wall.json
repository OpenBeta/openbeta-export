Home to some nice moderates that have some length to them. Better than average rock (for Med Wall) for the most part except for the chossy band that runs the entire length of Med Wall.More work being done Dec 2020 to expand it leftward to New Testament as was originally envisionedWe're doing our best to clean the rock and keep it clean BUT, still use caution and watch for stuff coming down from above. More traffic will clean up this (and every other) area.Big thanks to Steve Tyo for \"discovering\" this area and doing a majority of the original cleaning involved not the right side. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:09.056Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:56.418Z"}
