This area is the upper section of cliff with a prominent ledge running along the middle. The ground level part of the cliff with minimal \"climbing\" is called Med School and has a series of practice anchors along it. The upper tier has a wide stretch of rock ~25-30' tall  The left, lower band is wider with short routes (2-4 bolts) while the upper, right section is a bit taller.  The upper right section is called the “Balcony”.  As of now, there are NO ROUTES on the lower left section. (Chopped)  The whole area has potential but needs more cleaning. Dirt, brush etc all need to go, hence the inspiration for the name of the Wall - Debridement.VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. Updates will be posted as they happen."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:09.057Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:45.747Z"}
