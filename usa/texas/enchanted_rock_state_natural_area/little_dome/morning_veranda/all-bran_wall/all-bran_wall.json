There are several established problems on the wall and many variations are possible. Mostly ranging from 5-easy to 5.8. This wall is sometimes used as a place to bring novice climbers. Soloists and boulderers also pass through the area from time to time. \n\n  For the most part the rock quality is good, but there is some choss higher up. Accordingly, many of the cracks availble at the top are poorly suited for anchoring top ropes. However, there are several large features that can be used as top rope anchors. Take huge slings. There are no bolts or fixed anchors. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:05.534Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:52.966Z"}
