Return To Balance and Harmonica Jam are also found on the same boulder pile. \n\n  Two options exist for descent: \n\n  1. Reverse the last few easy moves back down to the flat alcove. From here move to the skier's right (climber's left)and scramble over or under a boulder to make an exposed move on to the wide chossy ledge with the dead tree above Harmonica Jam. Traverse across the ledge to the far end where the ground is higher and down climb about 6' of low angle questionable rock. \n\n  2. Reverse the last few easy moves back down to the flat alcove. Then scramble up the 4th class backside of the boulder which forms the front of this formation. On the front top side you will find the top anchors for Return To Balance and you can rappel from there.","protection":"A single rack is plenty. \n\n  There are no bolts, top anchors, or fixed pro on this climb.

Not sure where I heard or read that. Nevertheless, the guide books refer to it as We Be Joes. \n\n  This climb consists of two parallel cracks that ascend the vertical wall of a large obscure cave. The left crack fizzles out before the top. The right crack starts out hands and becomes fingers near the top. The rock quality is generally pretty good, but it tops out into a semi-rotten trough that is pretty much always filled with debris. About 4 years prior to this writing I cleaned out the crack which was quite packed with mud and debris. As of about a year and a half ago it was still clean. Honestly, this is a pretty good crack and worth doing. \n\n  Please don't be tempted to sling the large egg shaped boulder that is balancing on the edge of the trough above We Be Joes and use it as an anchor. I absolutely would not trust it to stay put. There is another larger boulder behind the spooky one.","protection":"A single rack with cams from small to BD#2. A head lamp is helpful, but it can be done without one.","location":"To find this route. Take the Lost Wall/Center Wall Trail to the large triangular Lost Wall boulder near the main dome. Look down into the caves a short distance from the climber's right side of Lost Wall. You're looking for a large room with parallel cracks going up the wall. You can't access the cave from here, but at least you will know where the cave is located. Then, you can follow the Main Dome toward Strawberry Jam and Texas Flakes. The top out from We Be Joes is very close to the bottom of Strawberry Jam and Texas Direct. From below Texas Direct (the slab below the Texas Flakes anchors)wander down into the caves and boulders to seek out the entrance into the cave. That's about the most specific I can get. Once you spot the cave from near Lost Wall, you shouldn't have too much trouble sniffing out the entrance."},"__v":0},{"_id":"LctLvbQXXkaxGO9Dl9UNhQ==","name":"Return To Balance","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Matt Twyman","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-98.8182,30.5053]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"108603100","mp_crag_id":"108603020","climb_id":"LctLvbQXXkaxGO9Dl9UNhQ==","areaRef":"vLuWMJk5Vl6jKM20oNOfQA=="},"content":{"description":"This climb was originally graded 5.10-.

Originally this climb was given a 5.9-grade in the Dome Driver Manual.

Consequently, getting off the ground is much harder than the 5.9 grade implies. \n\n  After figuring out a way to start it, continue up the lower angle slab. Then pull the tricky to protect boulder problem found on top of the slab to the climber's left. \n\n  The descent is also less than ideal.
