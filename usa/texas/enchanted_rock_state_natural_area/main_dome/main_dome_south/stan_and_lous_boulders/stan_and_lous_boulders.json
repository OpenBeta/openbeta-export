There are established problems around 20' in height on all sides mostly in the V0 to V2 range, including a fun and easy crack problem on the front side (facing the parking lot). The landings are generally pretty good. Bring a pad."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:06.213Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:17.523Z"}
