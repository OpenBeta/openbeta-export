Give it a try!  The route starts to the left of Romb-a-saurus.  Start on the same boulder as Romb-a-saurus but left side instead of right side.  Step across the small gap onto the triangular shaped part of the shelf.  The first hold is a sharp right facing flake.  Move to the left along the shelf and once you are under two edges, start heading up.  Move up and towards the arete.  Once obtaining the arete with your left hand, move up and to the right using sharp holds on the arete.  Eventually you will gain the obvious jug at the top and top-out.","protection":"Anchors set on other side of the boulder similar to The Romb and Romb-a-saurus.
