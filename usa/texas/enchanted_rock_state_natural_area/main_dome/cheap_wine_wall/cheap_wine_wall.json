To my knowledge this is the last line at Erock to be bolted from the ground up. Since then it has become a very popular line. Presumably because it is quite reasonably protected by Erock standards. \n\n  Pitch 1: Start on the low angle slab and clip one bolt before the overlap.

The first bolt above the ledge can be used for both. Kracken is the line to the right and Newark goes left. After clipping the second bolt it may be helpful to back track and unclip the first bolt to reduce rope drag. The third bolt protects the second crux.

Three more bolts are located on the black streak before reaching the double bolted anchors that are also shared with Dome Driver.
