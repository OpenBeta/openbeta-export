Start at the base of a long, clean slab just left of the prominent overlap that marks the left side of the Cheap Wine Wall.  Climb past seven bolts to a pair of top anchors in a shallow dish just right of the Fatman Flake.  While there are a couple sections where the wall is a little steeper, there is no real crux.  Fun, 5.6 climbing to the anchors. \n\n  P2. Climb up and left from the P1 anchors past the Fatman Flake.  The crux is a steep smooth headwall that leads to the first bolt (5.8/5.9 range).  Once past the first bolt, the angle and the climbing both ease significantly.  Climb past two more bolts to a two-bolt belay on the Broadway Ledge.  Short pitch. \n\n  P3. Another short pitch.  Climb an easy slab up and right from the P2 anchors to a two-bolt rap station. \n\n  From the rap anchors on top of P3, rap with two ropes back to the P1 anchors near the Fatman Flake.

If the sun is right, you can see the P1 anchors from the start. ETIL shares the P1 anchors and upper two pitches with Harder Than It Looks. For P2, climb up the flake and continue up the unprotected slab to a ledge with the P2 anchors (60 ft). P3 goes up the slab for another 100 to 130 ft (depending on where you choose to build an anchor). You can also just clip the P2 anchors and continue to the top of P3.This is a good route for a novice leader, although the start is a bit run-out (fall potential is low).

The first possible pro is about 25 ft up in a couple of crumbling flakes.  There is another small flake about 50 ft up and right, then a sizeable overlap about 60 ft up.  The climbing to the overlap is no harder than 5.4.  Above the overlap the climbing is slightly harder but there are a couple cracks for ample protection opportunities.  There are two-bolt anchors at the top of both P1 and P2.
