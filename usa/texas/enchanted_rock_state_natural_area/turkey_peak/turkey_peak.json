It immediately attracts your attention because unlike all of the other formations in the park, Turkey Peak is not a dome, but an actual peak.  Considered to be the oldest rock anywhere in the park, it has a completely different feel and type of climbing than the other areas.  All of the climbing (ten routes from 5.4 to 5.12a) is found high on the south-southwest face which makes the climbing here feel a little exposed.  As you approach the park entrance, you can look to the right and see if anyone is on the wall.  This is a great area early morning area in the summer (when itÂ’s in the shade) or winter afternoon area (sun and protected from the wind).  The top of the peak can be reached by scrambling up the northwest side, or by climbing the Central Ramp route at 5.4.  The Central Ramp route also serves as a good landmark separating the Mighty Dog Wall from the southwest face."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:24:59.434Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:02.261Z"}
