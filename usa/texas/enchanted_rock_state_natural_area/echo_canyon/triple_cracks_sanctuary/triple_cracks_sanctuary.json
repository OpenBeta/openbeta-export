Middle Crack is an excellent climb, and a must do for any E-Rock visitor.  The start is more of a flake with good lieback moves than a crack.  The crux comes early - about 10-15 feet up, the crack curves up and left, leaving a small 'bulge' on the right (protects well with a #2 Camalot).  There is a second, smaller 'bulge' above the crux.  Continue up the crack as it goes from fists to hands and eventually to fingers.  The climbing gets easier as you get higher.  Belay/rap from anchors at the top (single rope rap).
