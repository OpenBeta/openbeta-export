Mesa is the more Westerly boulder and Pinnacle is the more Easterly boulder which butts up against the boundary fence. Nearly every exploitable feature on the upper faces of these rocks are incorporated into one established problem or another. Most problems are in the V0-V2 range. Cruxes usually come early, the top outs are kinda high, the down climbs will get your attention, but the landings are generally pretty flat."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:25:05.520Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:52.750Z"}
