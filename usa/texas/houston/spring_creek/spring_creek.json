Multiple trees along the ledge, East of the overlook, in ideal spots for setting top rope anchors. Cliff face gets progressively steeper (ranging from M1-M4) as you travel East along the creek. Watch the weather, as the creek bed becomes flooded (sometimes for days) after rain, restricting access from the Spring Creek Greenway Trail."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:24:59.437Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:35.638Z"}
