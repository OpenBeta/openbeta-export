Start up a dirty, left facing corner on the right side of the massive chimney.  Pull a cruxy move over a bulge.  This pitch sucks, but it's fairly well protected and only about 60 feet long.  Belay in the chimney.  I found better rock and a better crack to the climber's left of the fixed piton.\n\nP2: 10b.  Move up and right onto the arete, passing some solid but questionable rock.  Climb the arete past a few bolts and solid gear, making a classic move to the left at the end by a tree.  Build a gear belay on a nice ledge just above the tree.  This pitch is great, and was surprisingly clean when we did it.  The bolts also looked to be in good shape.\n\nP3: 5.9. It is possible to head up and right on easier terrain, but the route actually turns a roof to the left and follows a crack feature to the top.  While this pitch would benefit from a good brushing, it has fun climbing and spaced but reasonable gear.","protection":"I remember placing a bunch of .3 and .4 sized cams, as well as a few hand sized pieces.  The crux pitch has 2 or 3 bolts, as well as a variety of gear options in horizontals.","location":"The route starts on the right side of the obvious huge chimney in a dirty, left facing crack/corner."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,b51eaea8-8aee-5fa5-b892-180460bb414d,e49403d3-8982-53a5-8160-0a68f4a168ee,5e089737-a3a5-572e-a65e-8a0f2a9633d6,fa177740-0215-5d34-9e8f-9a45a6286f53","pathTokens":["USA","North Carolina","2.
