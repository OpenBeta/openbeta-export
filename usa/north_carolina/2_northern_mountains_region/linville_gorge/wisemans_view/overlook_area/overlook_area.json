The rock is pretty good but can seem a bit dirty at times.  The second pitch was re-bolted to make it safer - there was ledge fall potential above the crux during the first several ascents.\n\nP-1 Climb past a large cam #4 to a line of 3 bolts that lead to a ledge for an optional belay at bolts.\n\nP-2 Boulder up and right past 3 bolts to another ledge and belay out right at bolts (shared anchor).  Note: protect the second with gear directional before moving right to anchor.  If rapping down, one 60 meter rope will suffice.\n\nP-3 No FFA yet.
