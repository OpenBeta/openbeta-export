It's similar to its nextdoor neighbor just a bit harder.\n\nClimb up to the seam/crack in the bulge and get small cams for gear (the crux piece is a #1 TCU size). There are two ways to climb the crux: To the right or to the left. If climbing right, the fixed stopper is necessary, as it would be very difficult to place blindly. If climbing left, the moves are more straightforward but maybe just as hard(?). Above the fixed stopper is a bolt.
