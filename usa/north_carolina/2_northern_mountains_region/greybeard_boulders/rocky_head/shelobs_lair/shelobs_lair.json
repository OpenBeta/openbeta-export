If you are feeling spicy, do an invert start with your feet above your head in the crack. Bump your feet high into the crack and pull up into the interesting hueco type holds. Make some moves on big holds to finish on the top lip of the boulder. A top out is definitely possible, but the top would need to be cleaned off a good bit. The rock that sits down and to the right of the main boulder is on for feet.","protection":"","location":"Far right side of boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,b51eaea8-8aee-5fa5-b892-180460bb414d,e49403d3-8982-53a5-8160-0a68f4a168ee,b27f5bc0-495b-5c12-8ee4-66e5b84f41d3,7487c6b0-adc7-537b-b17b-1b38302b3aa0,48c8f9dd-945c-54c1-bd0c-453fb95fe8af","pathTokens":["USA","North Carolina","2.
