This amazing problem can probably be done many, many different ways, however all are probably around v10 and all make for a great climb.\n\nSit start on an obvious undercling at the base of the rock and bump a right hand onto the sloper edge leading up. left hand way out left to a sharp little crimper, bump the heel up and bring a right hand into the next high, juggy undercling. Re-arage feet, match and bring a right hand up into the good right hand edge on the mini-lip. Bump out left into the worst hold I've ever tried to pull on, and then comes the variation and the crux. Find a way to move up into the good jug (I get a high left foot just below the lip and pop way up to the crimp right beside the jug), and finally commit to the best and scariest move in the field. Top out and take in the beauty.","protection":"Pads!
