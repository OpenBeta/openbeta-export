Negotiate your way around the crimpy diagonal block to where the gently overhanging wall meets the start block and finagle your way right aiming for a crescent shaped jug above. Lock on this and find a way to fire up and right (crux) to the usually chalked jug on the arete, near where the wall splits with the lower part angling towards Men are From Moore's and the upper part continuing up the massive overhang.","protection":"Several pads - the landing area is messy but can be well covered with enough pads to make it safe.","location":"Starts in the hole under the very large boulder left of Men are from Moore's.
