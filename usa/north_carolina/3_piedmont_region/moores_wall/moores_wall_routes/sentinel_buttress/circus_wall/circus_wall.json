The Select Climbs guide calls this \"possibly the best 5.7 in North Carolina;\" in fact, it may very well be the best for the grade in the southeast. The wild exposure and the juggy roof make for an experience on lead that you won't soon forget. A trip to Moore's just to do this one superlative climb would not be a wasted one.\n\nP1 -- Starting at the base of Sentinel Buttress, climb the first pitch of that route or any of the variations to get to the Crow's Nest ledge. 5.5, 80'\n\nP2 -- From the left end of the Crow's Nest, make a tenuous and exposed traverse left, clipping a bolt; continue left to the base of a crack system (be sure to adequately protect the traverse for your second). Climb the crack up to an alcove/rest stance below an imposing roof; pull the roof on fantastic holds, then continue up a steep section to easier ground, topping out in the trees. Enjoy the view! 5.7+, 140'\n\nTo descend after you top out, scramble climber's right to the bolted rap station at the top of that climb and make two raps to the ground.","protection":"Take a full range of cams and passive pro; small pieces are useful to protect the traverse.
