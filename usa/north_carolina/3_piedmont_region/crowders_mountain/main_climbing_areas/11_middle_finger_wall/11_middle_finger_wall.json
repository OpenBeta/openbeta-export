Great protection leads to a small alcove with a cresant shaped dihedral/crack. Follow the cresant crack up and cliff right while following the crack system.\n\nAfter further inspection from the Backside Trail I found that there is a more dominant crack feature cliff left of the cresant dihedral/crack that slices Middle Finger Wall all the way to the top. From the cresant you climb cliff left instead of following the crack system up and cliff right.\n\nLook up and locate a tree on a ledge. Once on this ledge the anchor for the balcony is cliff right on another ledge or you can climb past this tree to the bush up above to get to the tippy top of Middle Finger Wall.\n\nMake sure to use runners, especially if you decide to traverse cliff right and up to The Balcony anchor. You can also break this wall up into two pitches but where is the fun in that?(kidding)\n\nThe first half of this route protects very well. It starts to get a bit chossy right before the tree ledge (I slung some chicken heads near their bases). Otherwise the climbing isn't too physically hard but the rock quality and exposure keep things a bit spicy!","protection":"Standard North Carolina Rack - Hexes, Tri-cams, Nuts, small-large cams","location":"Cliff left of 'The Balcony'\n\nLocate a small seam leading to a cresant crack."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ZblpMsu+VHG7NooURTty1g==","name":"Pocket of Like'N","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"Wes Love, Doug Reed","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-81.27419,35.23489]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107312336","mp_crag_id":"106099920","climb_id":"ZblpMsu+VHG7NooURTty1g==","areaRef":"cBsirw9iXtW2y7Q515fDdg=="},"content":{"description":"Face climbing on large brittle holds.","protection":"North Carolina Trad Rack.\n\nNatural Anchor.
