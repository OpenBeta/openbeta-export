After looking at the route for the first time that phrase kept running through my mind because it seemed too good to be true. Then theres the stopper 'crucifix' move. So with Spirtitual Warfare setting a theme, the name seemed fitting.\n\nSuperstar is one of the best hard lines in the Cookbook. Beautiful flow and esthetics are difficult to come by on harder routes but this one really delivers. It has four very bouldery sections with good rests on continuously steep rock.\n\nFrom the lower platform, boulder up the slab 20' onto a small perch beneath the first bolt. Stickclip this bolt. Small holds lead to 30' of easier climbing and a nice stance. Get into the first crux of 5-6 big moves on small holds to a large jug at half height. Fire the big crucifix move out right and pull through a roof to another good rest.
