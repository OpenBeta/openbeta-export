The start is still a little dirty and needs a little time to clean up. This one is a little more interesting than the climb to the left and will require a little more technical climbing on smaller holds. There is a huge jug at the fifth bolt. Most of the climb trends to the right side of the anchors, other than the start and the fifth bolt. To get the best rock for an anchor, the bolt had to be placed to the right, making it necessary to now step over the rope to continue on. However, the rope lays cleanly and does not cause any interference. That jug at the fifth bolt is one of those hero type holds and makes what looks like a tough move a lot easier. It's really fun. The route ends before reaching the top, but there are additional anchors without rings should anyone want to top it out.","protection":"Six bolts and ring anchors on the top of the climb. There is an additional set of anchors closer to the top to allow toproping.","location":"Far right side of the upper tier, to the right of Pumper.

There are currently two bolted lines in this area and this is the one to the left. It starts in fairly easy rock up through some flakes and fractured rock. The last move to the rings can be done by climbing straight up past the last bolt, or by traversing left at the last bolt to access an easier last move. However, you might find the traverse to be worse than just climbing straight up to the anchors. When we were climbing this on trad gear, we would top out by making the traverse or by angling up to the right in order to access the top.\n\nI can't remember the exact date we bolted the route but it was purposely left off of here to keep people off of it. There was a loose block that was shaped in such a way that it would not come out from the wall. Rather than mess with it any more and risk damaging the route, the rock was bolted in place with a long anchor. Some may feel that the second bolt is a bit runout from the first, but there was no decent rock in which to install an additional bolt. The climbing is solid enough to not really need another bolt. Other than the finish, this route has changed very little over the years. Keep in mind that we climbed this on trad gear. The route is now sport only.","protection":"Five bolts and ring anchors at the top.","location":"This is on the far right side of the upper tier. It can be accessed from the right side but we prefer that it is accessed from the left side, as one would do to set up a toprope on the lower tier. Around February of every year, buzzards nest in the rocks on the right hand side and the park would prefer that the birds be left alone. Do\n\nnot\n\nthrow rocks at the buzzards to scare them off. Of the two routes in this area, this is the one to the left.
