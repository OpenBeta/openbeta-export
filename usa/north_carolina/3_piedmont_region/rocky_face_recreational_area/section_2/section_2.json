The two routes originally come together for a moment and split at the small roof. Now, Twins Left heads straight up towards the anchors through some steeper rock with far less holds than the route to the right. It is a bit more direct than Twins Right. The routes were near mirror images of each other in the middle and were of equal grade, hence the names. It is still a decent line but will probably stay a top-rope route.

Do not start on Sunny Day. The first two bolts are not in the most ideal locations but it was the best rock at the time.

There is a really nice side-pull on the ledge, a few feet right of the second bolt. Step up on the hold near the bolt and then up to the ledge.

Stick your right foot into an obvious dish and swing the left foot up over the top of the ledge. Under-cling the uppermost horizontal to clip the rings. The rings were placed as far right as possible to allow other climbers to still be able to use Sunny Day. If there are not other climbers on Sunny Day, or climbers waiting, it is ok to use the anchors that were previously shared by both routes. This route was mistakenly called Layback Flakes, which was one of the early routes in this section. We are not completely certain of the original line but it most likely was closer to Sunny Day. This line is not a 5.8 so don't get excited. We climbed it for years on trad gear since it had decent pro but it is fairly certain that Steve Pope and crew had already climbed all of this rock. After installing the anchors, I did rope solo it a couple of times to test the clips.
