Start on the great jug hold slightly above head height, pull-up and mantle using just one arm to execute both the pull-up and the mantle. After I had straight armed the mantle out, I attempted to get my foot of the same jug hold that my hand was on,.. it was proving awkward balance wise, so I lightly stabilized my body using my other arm and hand on top of the boulder. I had envisioned the problem as using entirely one arm,.. but, I came up short,.. Still, by far the singular most powerful move that I have ever done. I used my left arm for the move.","protection":"I did the problem without a pad(s), however the year was late Winter of 1982.","location":"Located in the small boulder field at the base of the South Face of Stone Mountain, as I recall, basically below Pandora's Way.
