One bolt is visible from the start.  If you are standing in the river bed looking at the face there is only one obvious blackened groove on the Bonas Defeat wall which this route follows. On the left middle of the wall.\n\nA handful of cams are useful, in particular I think a green or blue alien protects a few dirty moderate moves before the first bolt.  This is a mixed route meaning you will need a rack but there are numerous bolts to clip.  The rusty bolts could certainly use replacing and might be worth backing up.\n\nIt should be noted that the bolts and steel bieners on this route are very old, the gates have been permanently rusted closed and might rust through altogether in the near future.","protection":"manky ass old bolts 1980s is that you calling?","location":"middle left side of the wall"},"__v":0},{"_id":"dig67yJPXrGsxlf9fQ5Llg==","name":"A Licheny Trick (original name unkown)","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-83.01007,35.21165]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"112121726","mp_crag_id":"112121696","climb_id":"dig67yJPXrGsxlf9fQ5Llg==","areaRef":"mP3bTtSVUSmNbb6YUhq2OA=="},"content":{"description":"(Bonas Defeat) \" It was named after a local hunting dog who had a boney ass.
