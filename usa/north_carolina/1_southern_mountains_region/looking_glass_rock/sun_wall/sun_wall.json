The Shull/Lambert guide reports Randy Mann was on the FA of this route when it was actually Ted Anderson who was on the FA. It is important to recognize Ted as the name for this route was inspired by Ted and comes from a Zappa song. Ted Anderson is a huge Zappa fan and we listened to a lot of Zappa when enroute to our \"many\" climbing adventures together.  We were also, of course, big fans of the objects of this song...\n\nAfter we did the first ascent & named it Titties & Beer this route got dubbed \"the world's hardest 5.8\". The story behind that is after we did the first ascent we were telling Jeep Gaskin, Grover Cable & some other friends about the new route. They asked us how hard we thought the route was. We thought about it and it seemed pretty easy compared to some of the scarefests we had done & were doing on the Glass and elsewhere and we also thought 5.10 was about the hardest we could climb back then. So off the cuff I said \"Oh, it's probably  about 5.8.\" Future ascents later confirmed that I might have had understated the rating a bit. Hence it became dubbed \"The worlds hardest 5.8\"  Goes to show its always good to have a concensus on ratings.... The 5.8 climber might need a beer or two after climbing the sensational, voluptuous, undulations on this route.\n\nRegardless of the original stated rating, for its grade it is a very cool route with a lot of character for a Looking Glass climb. We originally did the route by starting from the left on the upper slab and traversing to underneath the prominent crack system where we placed a bolt and belayed. We also later added a 10+ or 11- R/X direct start that we toproped at first and I led at one point. This variation climbed direct up a step slab off the ground with little or no pro to below the belay below the crack. The route has some hard moves to gain the crack and that is what I thought was the crux on the FA. Continue on up the crack and belay near the top. From there move out left a bit to find a spot where you can move thru the bulges and start trending right and then up. It has been a long time since I have done the route but follow the natural line to the top. You might consult the guide book if you want a more accurate description of where the route goes.","protection":"Standard Looking Glass Rack","location":"Right side of the Sun Wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"mwkTtKsPXE6b+H0wQIO8wg==","name":"Scotty Pippen","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Phil Hoffmann, Brian Williams 2010","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.79529,35.30308]},"left_right_index":17,"mp_id":"107306973","mp_crag_id":"106523678","climb_id":"mwkTtKsPXE6b+H0wQIO8wg==","areaRef":"4j1bD53cVw2bw62nYVGpEA=="},"content":{"description":"A var. of Patrick Ewing.\n\nBelay at the base of the P.

With TCU's (which they didn't have on the first ascent) the route may or may not deserve a solid R rating depending on how brittle your bones are / how lucky you are, but for all the cruxes you are a above your pro making for commiting climbing. The final crux bulge is a potential ankle breaker due to the fall onto a 65 or 70 degree slab from a vertical bulge when your feet are about 6 feet above gear.\n\nP1: Climb steep groove past numerous horizontals to an easy roof, then climb groove past 3 bolts to a gear belay with hand sized cams in a horizontal (5.10d) - I found the crux of this pitch to be the hardest single move on the climb\n\nP2: Climb groove and then the face left of the groove past 3 bolts. After the 3rd bolt a small hybrid alien or probably a small TCU in a horizontal in the groove protects what used to have been a runout to the 2 bolt anchor.

Though you are not especially far above your gear, this bulge might be the most dangerous part of the climb due to the slick rock and potential ankle breaking / ankle spraining fall.
