If you're climbing at this grade in western NC, think about adding this to your short-list.\n\nStand start the slopey ramp wherever you can manage to paw on. Ride it out to a small crimp and then up and left to a slopey crimp rail. Surmount the crux and top out.\n\nLocal Travis Gray added a sit start which makes this thing even more classic. The sit goes at V10 and adds several more hard moves on bulletproof granite.","protection":"Several pads and a spotter or two.","location":"Hike almost to the cliff and veer left for a couple hundred yards."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ixSlnAEMUZGo81e5kwgnFg==","name":"The Ramp Sit","yds":"V10","grades":{"yds":"V10","font":"7C+","vscale":"V10"},"fa":"Travis","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.79018,35.30553]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"119280257","mp_crag_id":"113848099","climb_id":"ixSlnAEMUZGo81e5kwgnFg==","areaRef":"nGyQa0sTVhmM3WZwgh9PoQ=="},"content":{"description":"https://www.instagram.com/p/B91_5qCHUe3/","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"E1opCFiGU3OPA9gEV3ojkA==","name":"Musashi","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.79018,35.30553]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"119685456","mp_crag_id":"113848099","climb_id":"E1opCFiGU3OPA9gEV3ojkA==","areaRef":"nGyQa0sTVhmM3WZwgh9PoQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start with hands in the jug rail, feet on the mossy slab.
