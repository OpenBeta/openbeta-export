Take on the 100+ feet of run out slab, with a good finger sized cam placement at around 80 feet, up into the corner below the slightly overhanging upper portion of the cliff where you can build a gear anchor. From here, follow the multiple crack systems over two roofs up onto the easy 5th class slab up into the trees. Walk down on either side (Climber's right is easiest). The initial 70-80ft of slab is 5-easy but completely run out. If this route sees more traffic I would love to have a bolt place somewhere here.","protection":"Standard Rack. #4 is helpful.","location":"Hike up from the trailside boulder until you reach the bottom of the slab."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,b51eaea8-8aee-5fa5-b892-180460bb414d,09830eb9-3d49-51e3-8127-6506b4f459de,8cfcbd6d-f009-5077-a70b-8f5bc5d25e5c,44eebd0b-8d75-5c01-b7fc-9dc13bde5f87","pathTokens":["USA","North Carolina","1.
