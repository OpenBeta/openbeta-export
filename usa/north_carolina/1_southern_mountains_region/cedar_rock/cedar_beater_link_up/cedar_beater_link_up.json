From what I hear, this involves less walking than the Crusher. We did it leisurely in 10.5 hours door to door. It's a nice link up with 1700 feet of climbing (much of which is low 5th class), about 7? miles of hiking, and surprisingly little bushwhacking. Specific crags can be topped out and linked together, making for a natural progression from crag to crag. Here was our path:\n\n1. North Cedar, Red Fern Area, \"Little Anne\", 5.10d, 170 ft. (tough friction slab)\n\n2. Main Wall, left, \"Name Unknown\", 5.9, 190 ft. (mostly bolted knob and crystal route)\n\n3. Halloween Slabs,\"Instructional Route\", 5.4, 180 ft.\n\n4. Stone Depot, \"Trinacious\", 5.7, 280 ft.(eyebrows)\n\n5. Hidden Cedar (located behind South Cedar), \"Science is Real\", 5.9, 200 ft.(unique moves at starting, then a friction crux at bolt)\n\n6. South Cedar, \"Pole Envy\", 5.8, 400 ft. (fun water groove climb)\n\n7. Up and Over Crag, \"Beater Completer\", 5.5R, 100 ft. (mailbox-sized quartz features, on wall that is climbers right of Halloween Slabs but can be top accessed via trail atop South Cedar)\n\n8. Stony Knob, \"Cedar View\", 5.7, 100 ft.(great view of Main Wall, Halloween, Up and Over Crag)","protection":"Trad","location":"Cedar Rock- use map in Cedar Rock and Satellite Crags (www.grounduppublishing.com) and/or with GPS.
