On the morning of April 20th, 1999 Rachel seemed not to be paying attention in class, preoccupied with something she was writing in her journal.  Then, sometime a little after 11am, while sitting with a friend outside for lunch, Rachel was the first of thirteen innocent persons to be killed at Columbine High School.  Later, out of a backpack with a bullet hole, her journal was found.  On the final page she had made a drawing of her eyes with thirteen clear tears falling from them upon a rose.  The same rose was discovered drawn in another diary, this time growing up out of a columbine plant with the words 'Greater love has no man than this, that a man would lay down his life for his friends'\" (John 15:13).","protection":"Rhodo stump, 2 bolts, TCU's.","location":"Below rhodo stump right of obvious corner.
