It follows a very shallow water groove. The climb \"Tennessee Mare\" is just to the left with its first bolt at 20 feet up and only two more after that.\n\nDepending on how you top out, this route can be a real rope stretcher.","protection":"There are 3 well-spaced bolts. The first bolt is around 15-20 feet up with some very thin moves to access it. The last bolt is at least 50 feet below any opportunities for anchors. Top belay options include bolts at the bottom and to climbers left of Camptown Races (Start angling to the right when leaving the water groove to reach these). There are another pair of bolts around 50 feet climbers left (angle left when leaving the water groove), or you can go straight up and thrash through undergrowth below the High Plains Drifter ledge.","location":"This climb is located on the wall below and to the left of the start of Camptown Races. When rapping in from the anchors at the base of Camptown races you should angle to your left to get to the start of Tennessee Stud--and to avoid a bushwacky landing.\n\nThe rappel takes two 60 meter ropes. One 70 meter might work if you're careful."},"__v":0},{"_id":"e4eBtQSJWJagsGTyDC7+CQ==","name":"High Plains Drifter Traverse","yds":"5.3","grades":{"yds":"5.3","french":"3+"},"fa":"unknownn","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.96245,35.24224]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"112209175","mp_crag_id":"112209122","climb_id":"e4eBtQSJWJagsGTyDC7+CQ==","areaRef":"6LPRO2egVFK00eNDJ7mbog=="},"content":{"description":"This route begins at the base of Camptown Races and follows a mostly vegetated ledge for a full rope length until you are above a tree island in the Dodge City area.

The top also has two three bolt anchors--one about ten feet above the other. When rapping in be sure to know the end of your rope as this pitch is almost a full rope length.","location":"This is the upper most climb in this section. The walk down to the anchors is fairly long, and gets steeper the closer you get to the top anchors.
