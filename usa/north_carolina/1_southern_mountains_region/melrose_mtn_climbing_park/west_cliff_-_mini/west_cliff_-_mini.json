The Crux would be the end of the problem due to the height, but the under cling start was surprisingly comfortable. In the photos there is a green route with an alternate ending that is less precarious and easier to top (V1) and the yellow top which has the uncomfortable height (V2+). My friend named the Green top \"Log\", and I named the Yellow top \"Club\".","protection":"If you are attempting the green top just make sure to have a crash pad, more than one is great. And if you decide to go for the higher (yellow) top I would make sure to only do that with a second person who can help protect you as you fall and make sure you don't roll off of the trail. I personally would NOT try the yellow top alone.","location":"The pictures I include should give a good idea as to where to start and end! There are some really good natural foot holds for the start, one being near the bottom right of where the crack begins, and another farther to the left where your left foot would naturally be. your hand start with an under cling position and you just start working your way left and up!"},"__v":0},{"_id":"BRrYlpQIUGqPC32M+WTX6g==","name":"GBH Tootaledge","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Kevin Junge, Jonathan Gerst, April 2020","type":{"sport":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.28014,35.20205]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"118721401","mp_crag_id":"119010762","climb_id":"BRrYlpQIUGqPC32M+WTX6g==","areaRef":"psXU76fkXSufxsADIytA5A=="},"content":{"description":"Crux is last move.  Watch for chossy holds.","protection":"3 bolts to anchors","location":"Furthest right route at the mini cliff above main West Cliff."},"__v":0},{"_id":"kmy2cFzmXYiZ/OrQJQTv7w==","name":"Charlie's Unbendable Toe","yds":"5.8-","grades":{"yds":"5.8-","french":"5b"},"fa":"Jonathan Gerst & Kevin Junge, Feb. 2020","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.28014,35.20205]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118560902","mp_crag_id":"119010762","climb_id":"kmy2cFzmXYiZ/OrQJQTv7w==","areaRef":"psXU76fkXSufxsADIytA5A=="},"content":{"description":"You may just need a stiff toe like ole Charlie to climb this great warm-up.  Named after Charlie's unbendable toe action from a rattlesnake bite near Hogback Mtn in '72.
