Landings vary depending on which face you are on. On the NE face of the boulder you can see an old railroad tie pounded into the rock at the top. This was placed by climbers in the 70's and was regularly used as a top rope anchor. As recently as the early 2000's it was still being used albeit backed up with a cam. Railroad spikes were made with carbon steel or worse iron...needless to say this \"anchor\" should serve as a historical relic and nothing more as it is likely highly corroded and untrustworthy. Anyways the faces worth climbing are well protectable by today's bouldering standards. Several ways to down climb, all a bit sketch but not too bad."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:58:10.465Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:07.644Z"}
