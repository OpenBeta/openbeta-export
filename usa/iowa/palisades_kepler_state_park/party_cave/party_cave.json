Since it is a cave, there is always water present dripping through some areas of the stone. Some of the rock is crumbly, but most of it is solid.  \n\n  The cave makes for an awesome place to work on hot summer days because of the shade and cooler weather. \n\n  Need at least two large crash pads as much of the area slopes down and there are many large rocks embedded in the ground. Also bring a flashlight, there are areas that have been unexplored (even a cave going upwards inside the cave) due to lack of light. \n\n  People have used this as a party cave, accessing it by boat so there is spray paint, and watch out for the shards of glass left from broken beer bottles (place needs to be cleaned)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:03:15.721Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:50.424Z"}
