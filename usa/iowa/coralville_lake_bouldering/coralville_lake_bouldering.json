All persons are strongly urged to seek competent instruction and develop appropriate skill before climbing on their own. The US Army Corps of Engineers does not certify climbers, instructors, or guides, or otherwise determine their qualifications. The US Army Corps of Engineers is not liable if a climber gets hurt or killed while climbing. If climbers choose to climb, they do so at their own risk!MANAGEMENTRock climbing is allowed on rock faces designated for such use by The US Army Corps of Engineers. Climbing or bouldering on undesignated rock piles is strictly prohibited due to its unstable nature. Developing new climbing areas in non-designated portions of the park will be permitted only after management approval through an identified process. Climbers interested in developing new areas may request permission in writing through the Iowa Climbers Coalition. Requests for new areas will be reviewed and sent to The US Army Corps of Engineers to determine the appropriateness of the request and impact on the resources present and future.SPECIFIC GUIDELINESThe placement of fixed protections, including bolts, chains, and others is not permitted. Rock alterations by chipping, chiseling, sculpting, drilling, defacing, or gluing/epoxying of  rock are not permitted. This includes the practice of dry tooling which involves using ice climbing tools on rock surfaces. Climbing and/or rappelling within a known habitat of any rare, threatened, or endangered plant or animal species as well in areas determined by The US Army Corps of Engineers to be ecologically significant is not permitted. Removing vegetation of any type is prohibited until permission requests for a new area have been approved by both the Iowa Climbers Coalition and The US Army Corps of Engineers. Removing excess vegetation in areas where climbing is permitted is not allowed. Cleaning of individual holds in approved climbing areas is permitted. The use of natural vegetation for anchor systems is prohibited. If a tree must be used for climbing purposes, padding must be used to prevent the rope, sling, or chain from damaging the tree. An appropriate amount of climbing specific manufactured bouldering pads must be used by all bouldering participants. All gear must be taken out of the park when the participant leaves. Gear is not allowed to be cached overnight in the park. All climbers and participants must adhere to existing park rules and regulations made by The US Army Corps of Engineers and Coralville Lake staff. Walk only on main trails established by Coralville Lake to avoid disturbing plant life and to prevent erosion. Do not use “social trails” that have been created by previous visitors.No climbing after dark is permitted. In other words, if you require the use of artificial light in order to see, stop climbing.Fires are not allowed in this area.Location pinning and any marketing (pictures, videos, descriptions, etc.) of areas within Coralville Lake on social media and other mediums are strictly prohibited by Coralville Lake Staff. CLIMBING PROTECTION:The US Army Corps of Engineers strongly enforces safe climbing practices. This means that an appropriate amount of crash pads are used and climbing partners are actively spotting. Chalk may be used on participants’ hands to avoid unexpected slipping. POLICY CHANGES: Normal policy review will be done regularly by the Climbing Advisory Committee and The US Army Corps of Engineers. Any alterations in policy or in rock climbing management plans will be posted at the climbing information sites or provided in written materials to climbers as far in advance as possible.Etiquette:Be a positive role model for other climbers.Be a good representative for the climbing community.Do not give bouldering problems an inappropriate name after establishing First Ascent.Carry out all trash waste you carry in. Cigarettes are litter too.Pick up trash and litter, regardless of if it is yours.Respect all closures.Limit group size and do not cause reason for attention.Leave music off.No loud cussing or inappropriate comments.NOTICE: All rules and regulations will be enforced by Coralville Lake Staff and the Iowa Climbers Coalition.
