Is this is a weekend destination? Nope. Nor is it a world class destination. However, the rock is good and the views of the Big Muddy are worthy of Mark Twain's pen. The main cliff-line is roughly 40-50 feet long and averages at about 14ft high. Tops are surprisingly good just be willing to commit to a strong mantle or pull up."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:03:15.337Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:50.256Z"}
