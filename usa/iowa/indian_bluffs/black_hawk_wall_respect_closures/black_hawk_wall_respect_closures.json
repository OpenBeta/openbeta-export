During summer it is difficult to see features like the Gunsight, which is a notch in the center of this wall.   \n\n  This wall is one side of a rib of limestone that ends with Chimney Rock overlooking Jurden creek.   \n\n  All of this area, the north east side, is closed to climbing, and has been since 2006, when the State of Iowa became concerned about our possible impact on delicate and rare snails, and mosses.  The idea may take some time to study, and locals respect the closure.   \n\n  Many other areas may be climbed at Indian Bluffs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:03:15.343Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:22.792Z"}
