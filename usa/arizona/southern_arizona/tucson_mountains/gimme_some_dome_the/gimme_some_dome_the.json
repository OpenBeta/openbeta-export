Bring your shortest quickdraw because 5' below and to the right (when looking off the top of the cliff) of the chain anchors there is a single bolt to re-direct the rope to above this route. As you rappel down clip the quickdraw into this bolt and then clip into the quickdraw with either just the tie-in side of the rope or both sides of the rope. Unclip the rope as you climb past it to the chain or just lower once you reach the re-direct bolt as the climbing above it is very low angle. This re-direct bolt is marked in the beta pic.","location":"Climbs the left side of the east face of The Gimme Some Dome. Start directly below the right edge of the cave 2/3 of the way up the face.
