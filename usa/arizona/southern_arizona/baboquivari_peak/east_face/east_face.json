The Bob Kerry guide gives it three stars. \n\n  Between the approach, climb and descent, expect to spend a long day on the rock.  Bring plenty of water and if you stray during the approach, climb, or descent (which is easy to do), expect to be in the dark and prepare accordingly. \n\n  Note that there is a tradition of taking I'itoi a gift at the summit.  If you are planning to take a gift for I'itoi, you might choose a gift that I'itoi can hand back out to stranded climbers. This might include lighters, waterproof matches, rain panchos, space blankets, flashlights, etc.  \n\nPitch 1\n\n  Climb straight up.  The first 30 or 40 feet are 5.easy to a 5.4 bulge.  Pull the bulge and continue up the easy face.  There is a tree to the left that can be used as a belay/rap station, or continue straight upward to a large ledge and an easy 4th class scramble up another 30 feet in a chimney to a notch with a vertical wall section on the right and lots of exposure to the left. There is a solid dead tree trunk here that can be used as a belay anchor. \n\nPitch 2\n\n  Climb the verical wall (5.6) via stemming or using good foot and hand holds.  The few moves here may seem a bit tougher than 5.6.  The massive exposure to the left of the route also adds to the experience.  30 feet of climbing gets you over the vertical section and back onto easy scrambling to a huge ledge for belaying. \n\nPitch 3\n\n  Scramble up the 4th class chimney past a shady tree to a belay ledge with blocky rocks. \n\nPitch 4\n\n  A couple of 5.6 lieback moves early in the pitch yield to lots of scrambling for 120 feet to what Bob Kerry describes as a 'spacious' vegetated ledge.  Compared to previous ledges in the climb, this ledge is small, but roomy enough for 2-3 people.  This ledge can be used for a belay; however, continuing another short 25 feet left via a traverse brings you to two anchor bolts and skips the short 25 foot traverse pitch in the Kerry guide.  These bolts are a bit manky but there is good opportunity for placing pro and establishing a solid anchor here.  Belaying here also helps with rope drag on the next fun pitch. \n\nPitch 5\n\n  A fun 5.easy lieback pitch climbs up for about 80 feet at which point you move right and start 3rd class scrambling.  At that point, find any comfortable place to belay once you get to the easy stuff.  From here, continue 3rd class scrambling and bushwacking until you reach a notch or gap.  Move left along the notch and scramble down.  There is more awesome exposure here to the left and some may choose to be belayed down from the point to the notch. \n\nPitch 6\n\n  Easy face climbing from the left part of the notch for about 20 feet quickly yields to a scramble all the way to the summit. \n\n  In general on this climb, follow the path of least resistance and you won't go wrong.","protection":"A light rack consisting of some small & medium cams, standard stoppers and some small to medium tricams. ","location":"Approach   The approach can be a bit tricky - both to find the Lion's Ledge and to also to find the start of the climb.  The start of the climb is located on the southeast portion of the Lion's Ledge.  However, you do not actually start the climb from the Lion's Ledge - you have to scramble up about 100 feet in a notch between a huge rock that is separated from the main east wall and the Lion's Ledge.  Look for a 50 foot tall huge rock formation that is separated from the main wall on the far southest part of Lion's Ledge.  You can scramble up the notch between this rock and the main wall from either either side of the separated rock formation. \n\n  At the top of the notch is the dead tree with rap slings described in Bob Kerry's guide.  From this point, scramble up and left (south) another 20 feet or so through some brush to a belay ledge.  The first pitch starts here - not from the notch but from above it. \n\n  If approaching from the east, drop your packs and gear up at the east saddle.  From the west, drop your packs and gear up at the base of the Great Ramp."},"__v":0},{"_id":"x5G2iL3fWYSSc7igeKpl1w==","name":"Moonscapes","yds":"5.11c","grades":{"yds":"5.11c","french":"6c+"},"fa":"Jim Waugh and Damon Williams, mid 90's","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.59661,31.77131]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"107016239","mp_crag_id":"105960483","climb_id":"x5G2iL3fWYSSc7igeKpl1w==","areaRef":"i93AckwTW5SioH7VFGAiiA=="},"content":{"description":"I climbed Moonscapes with Steve Curtis last weekend and Kerry is wrong about some things. His description is enough to get you up the route but you'll be in for some real surprises, so stop reading now if that kind of outing sounds appealing to you!A note on the name: although listed as \"Moonscape\" in the Kerry guide, the correct name, according to Damon Williams, is \"Moonscapes.\" This is a really spectacular and serious route, I give it three stars with the understanding that some will probably violently disagree with that take. I don't know anyone else who's done the whole route other than the first ascentionists, although Jim Scott told me he did the first three pitches and rapped after the crux, but it's certainly possible a few other parties have done it. It has incredible position on Babo's east face, with an overhanging crux pitch high over Lion's ledge and the wild valley below, and steep, thought-provoking climbing continuing up the exposed face above. The rock was pretty good even with the absence of traffic; the pro, not so much. Anyone who fancies him/her self a rock-solid 5.11 climber is welcome to give the overhanging crux pitch a whirl and reevaluate! I was thankful it wasn't my lead and question whether I could lead it at all.From Kerry's description, we thought the route would basically be over after pitch 3. Boy were we wrong! Pitches 4-5 had steep, sustained 5.9/10 groove climbing with rounded and insecure holds as the main features.Steve led the crux pitch (and did a brilliant job); here's the beta-intensive description he wrote for another site (don't click on the link if that sort of thing offends you).Edit: Steve's description seems to have gone down in flames along with the rest of rockclimbing.com, so here's a description from memory ten years later (it was, after all, a very memorable route). There are anchors on top of pitches one to three, although from hazy memory one of these might have only had one bolt? Locate the start by traversing Lion's Ledge past the spring and the obvious \"Cougar Cave.\" The start is a little ways past Cougar Cave, look for a small broken buttress of rock with a bolt (the first bolt on Don's Crack) above it. The big gash of Don's Crack, which doesn't reach the ground, is about 100 feet further left along Lion's Ledge. Pitch one: climb easy rock to the bolt, then continue straight up past 4 (?) more bolts and a couple of gear placements to an anchor. 5.10 R, ~100-120 feet. You can also veer left above the first bolt to clip the second bolt on Don's Crack to shorten one of the run-outs, but this will create rope-drag unless you back-clean. Pitch two: move out left into a left-leaning undercling feature, then up following the vague crack system past two bolts all the way to a two-bolt anchor. This pitch protects okay, still a little spicy in places. 5.10, 120+ feet (?)Pitch three: the money! move up right of the belay and clip a bolt, then move up and left into the obvious, thin undercling. Load it up with marginal gear, then move up and left (scary .11- move), to two more bolts protecting more .11- laybacking. Reach a good stance with some good pockets for gear, then commit to the overhanging .11-/.11 terrain up and left (*not* straight up as Kerry says!), reaching a hidden bolt and eventually the obvious, right-leaning 4\" crack (also 5.11, or at least feels like it since there's no real rest beforehand). Belay at the top of the crack (at least one bolt here, possibly two). A wild, steep pitch with plenty of climbing above gear and four or five distinct 5.11 sections, but mostly seems safe except for the initial .11- undercling. The total package felt like 11+, and the rock is mostly good. ~130+ feet? Pitch four: move up and right into a flared .9ish groove that's tricky to protect, but good climbing on good rock. I *think* there was an anchor at the top of this pitch but either way the belay spot is pretty obvious. Shorter pitch, around 100'. Pitch five: continue up the flared crack system through sustained.10-/.10 climbing with consistently tricky gear - offsets could be useful here, I can't remember if we had them. At the groove's end, finesse a path right and slightly up on .10 face climbing to a tree belay at the left edge of a bowl of sorts - be mindful of your second here as well. This is a great pitch on good rock, but fairly serious. 5.10 PG-13 or quite possibly R, ~140+ feet?Pitch six: it's over - romp up .7/.8 terrain for a full rope-length until you reach third-class scrambling where you can unrope and scramble to the summit.","protection":"Double set to #3 camalot, single #4 camalot (new or old). Offset cams, totems, and/or tricams could be useful on the upper pitches, but I don't think we had any. The first pitch requires only a light single set of gear. On the crux, Steve left the extra .75, 1, and 2 camalots and was fine. Pitch one has 5 or 6 bolts, pitch two has 2 bolts and the crux pitch has 4. Anchors atop pitches 1-4 have either one or two bolts. Pitches four through six have no lead bolts. All of the bolts were in good shape and looked to be of recent enough vintage that it's possible someone has replaced them since the FA. ","location":"Shares the start of Don's Crack.

The climb consists of three easy roped pitches with scrambling in between.From the saddle of Thomas Canyon, head southwest up to the prominent notch.Pitch 1: 40 ft. This pitch ascends the chimney with a chockstone. Protection is sparse, but the climbing is not difficult. There are two belay bolts at the top. From the top, hike along the rock wall on your left to the south about 100 yards to a nice west-facing slab.Pitch 2: 150 ft. Climb the slab directly following the meager crack. The crack will take some small to medium cams, and nuts. The climbing is easy and a bit runout near the top.

This is the famous Ladder Pitch. In the 1930s, the CCC installed a ladder at this pitch, as well as stairs at the Great Ramp on the west face to facilitate easy access to an observation tower at the summit. The ladder, stairs, and tower have long since been dismantled, but remnants of rusted steel and wood remain strewn throughout the route. The Ladder Pitch doesn’t protect well, although it is low 5th class. There is a pair of new-ish bolts halfway through the pitch and a pair of new bolts with chains at the top of the pitch, next to the tree that was previously used as the belay/rappel anchor. Belay from these bolts.From the top of the Ladder Pitch, head right (west). Climb a short chimney with a chockstone, entering a gully with scree and light vegetation. Turn left at the gully, following the gully up toward the summit. As the gully system weakens and opens up, stay close to the wall on your right and continue the scramble to the summit.For descent, carefully retrace your steps and rappel all three pitches. Be careful when you are routefinding on the way down. It is easy to descend into the wrong gully when leaving the summit. The oaks can hide the edges of the cliffs. These gullies invariably end at sheer cliff edges. ","protection":"A single set of finger, hand and fist sized cams or tricams (e.g. a set of Camelots in .2 to #3 sizes), and four to six shoulder-length slings, for slinging horns and building anchors at bolts.A single 70m rope will take you to the bottom of the Ladder Pitch from the top anchors in just one rap.
