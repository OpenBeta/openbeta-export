Bring some slings for the wandery nature if you are wanting to do it in one big push. Other wise it is recommended to bring your partner up from the bottom of the final pitch inside the slot on the good ledge.P1. Easy 5.7 50ft up to big ledgeP2. 5.9 Money pitch. Super fun. Very exposed and good route exploration. bring a couple slings or long draws for bolts 1 and 5 to help with rope drag. 100 ft to chain anchor for top roping. 110 ft up to belay ledge. At the anchors go left. Ignore the random bolt to the right. It will lead to nothing. P3. 5.6 ride up the crack to the right and enjoy the top out 25 feet. Decent either rappel or walk off. Both are viable options. ","protection":"Bolts. Bring a couple of slings to extend and help with rope drag on the 2nd pitch. If you want there are some cracks that you can plug gear into but its all very well protected by bolts for those of us that are just sport climbers.","location":"Obvious bolted arete up the middle of the wall. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,5e8e250c-01e5-5887-af93-35c4793bd72f,5ec3049e-af29-55be-9cb2-1bf50b73d70b","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Black Hills","Graduation Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.40232,32.85119]},"bbox":[-109.40285525730579,32.85074033981814,-109.40178474269422,32.85163966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121861606","area_id":"XsMEnq8pVb6cshv1C3PXCw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.40285525730579,32.85074033981814],[-109.40178474269422,32.85074033981814],[-109.40178474269422,32.85163966018187],[-109.40285525730579,32.85163966018187],[-109.40285525730579,32.85074033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the big wall to the North of Hwy 191 just past the straight away.
