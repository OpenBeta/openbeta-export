In the fall/winter it could get cold and windy in the shade. In late spring and summer you might want the shaded. In any case, the chasing sun and shade is as easy as moving a few paces one way or the other. Now, the base of this cliff is a real pain in the ass because it's steep and loose like a moraine affording it its very fitting name.
