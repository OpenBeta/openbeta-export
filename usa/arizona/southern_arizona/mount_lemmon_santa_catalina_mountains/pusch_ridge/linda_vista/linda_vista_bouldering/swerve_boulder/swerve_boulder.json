This is the linkup of swerve into shift, and while no moves are particularly hard by themselves the lack of resting positions on unrelenting crimps make this a power endurance testpiece. Luckily, none of the holds are really big enough for you to get pumped.  \n\n  While this line is somewhat of a traverse, interesting movements and solid holds make it a worthy problem. \n\n  I wasn't sure what to grade this since it's almost a sport climb.  It took a good amount of night sessions in a time I felt pretty solid and took considerably more goes than other V11's I sent around that time period.  However due to the endurancey style, and hesitation to grade harder so I decided to play it safe with 11.  I'm a punter when it comes to endurance anyways so it's probably not too hard.
