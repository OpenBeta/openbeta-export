Near the right end of the crag youll see a large oak tree about halfway up the rock. To the right is a huge thumb of rock. This climb finishes just right of the thumb, above a tree.  Start in a corner system behind an oak tree. Climb right face of corner past a bolt  to a bulge where a step left accesses the right leaning corner that heads back right. Climb this steep corner thru some flakey rock past a bolt. Look for a bolt out left to protect exit moves about 20 feet from the end of the corner, just above a strip of green rock. Pull past another bolt to a ledge with a short chimney. A bolt protects a tricky move into the chimney. Continue up past a tree to a 2 bolt anchor out on the right face.  Double ropes help to reduce rope drag on this wandery route and wise usage of runners. You might want to be prepared to break it into 2 pitches.
