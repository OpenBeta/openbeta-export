My partner and I took a different variation on pitch 2 since we could not see the best way to reach the center crack. Either way looks like all three finishes have some good cracks. \n\nThere are three vertical crack systems. The route follows the center cracks.  Pitch 1 -  face climb to a new beefy two bolt anchor  90 ft\n\n Pitch 2 - My partner went up 20 ft and could not see an easier passage to the center crack that the first ascentionist took.  It felt at least .9+ and no gear so he climbed up and left to belay underneath the left side corner system. \n\n Pitch 3 - hand jams and fingers to the top","protection":"Singles or doubles to 2/3 camalot   One 60 m rope","location":"Look at the picture in the backcountry book"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,f2591e24-8f94-5cb3-9f02-92bfe3f5cd61,95c08716-ce16-535b-9d58-9fa39f6b360f","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Mount Lemmon (Santa Catalina Mountains)","Thumb, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.91157,32.35518]},"bbox":[-110.91210230171525,32.35473033981813,-110.91103769828473,32.355629660181854],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117705750","area_id":"lcCHFs4WU1udWJ+jn2s2Dw=="},"content":{"description":"Rectangular formation seen from almost anywhere in the city of Tucson. It resembles an ancient desert tower but without the sandstone. The summit is free standing making it an adventurous ascent from either side. The most popular route is called “ In Memoriam of a town” and also the only one listed in the Backcountry Book by Bob Kerry. It seems not many people climb around these areas, but there are those who seek these far away summits in the Catalinas. To put this more in perspective, Steve Grossman ( local old skool hardman) was up there running it out on old gear / homemade bolts and pitons during the 1970’s."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:49.837Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:35.681Z"}
