Start here and paddle up an easy, low-angle slab, aiming directly for the crack I60'). Follow the crack/groove, as it very gradually thins, to its terminus below some chicken heads. About 10' above the point where the crack/groove terminates, set a belay on a decent stance using a couple of decent chicken heads. About 10' higher still is a large knob that, if you're comfortable with a single-point belay, would also work.P2: 40' - Continue upward about another 10', then walk on a substantial ledge another 20' or 30' to a cluster of 3 boulders. You could use the rope to anchor to the boulder(s), but a hip belay should be more than adequate.Note; You could probably do this in a single pitch with a 60 m rope, but rope drag might have you hating life. We used a 50.","protection":"First pro is at about 60', but on very easy ground. Typical Mount Lemmon shallow, bottoming, outward flaring crack-like groove.
