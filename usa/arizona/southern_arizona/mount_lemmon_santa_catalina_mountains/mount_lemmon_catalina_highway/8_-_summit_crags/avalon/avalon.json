It was mostly developed by the late Steve Johnson and friends around 2012. The routes at Avalon tend to be slab-oriented, with the occasional steep, cruxy bulge move.  You can get by with just quickdraws (12-15 or so), but a light rack opens up more good terrain. The rock is mostly south facing, so the routes get a lot of sun, but the base is shaded by some majestic evergreen trees so you can stay cool even on the hottest days of summer.  As usual, the best details are found in Squeezing the Lemmon III - only about half the routes are listed here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":29,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:53.016Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:07.840Z"}
