This route tops out the formation and you can walk off the backside. It also features great gear/rock and comfy bolted belay stances, along with afternoon shade. The crux of the route is pitch 3 where you move up and right off an exposed ledge.\n\n Pitch 1 - Go up a vegetated ramp and scope out the short hand crack. Follow it up to a small ledge and up to a two bolt anchor beneath the obvious large roof.  5.8, 100'\n\n Pitch 2 -Traverse left and around the corner to the South side of the formation. Climb a short corner and belay on bolts. 5.6, 60'\n\n Pitch 3 - A few steep and exposed 5.10- moves right and then up take you to an enjoyable 5.8 varied wide crack and up to the “Dabaloni Ledge”. 5.10-, 100'\n\n We didn't climb it, but a 5.7-8-ish-looking variation with good pro exists off of the belay to the left. This can be used to skip the crux, bringing the route down to the 5.8-level.\n\n Pitch 4 - From the ledge pick and choose a fun way to the top.
