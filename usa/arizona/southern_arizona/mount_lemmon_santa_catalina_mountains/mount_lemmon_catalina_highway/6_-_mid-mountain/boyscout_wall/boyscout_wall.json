It is east southeast facing and gets a lot of sun until later in the day.  Depending on the time of year the cliff has a waterfall/water streak running down it that has patches of beautiful green moss hanging from it.  At the bottom of the waterfall is a small to large 10X10 pool and a lot of green grass.  During the Monsoon sections may be unclimbable due to the waterfalls output. \n\n  The cliff itself is 115 feet tall and despite a broken appearance the climbing remains fun even when the difficulties ease.  The rock is pretty unusual for Mount Lemmon with a coarse sandpaper like texture at the bottom and smoother holds higher up.  There are a lot of in cut edges which keeps the climbing relatively easy and fun even when it looks like it will get hard."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:51.772Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:06.330Z"}
