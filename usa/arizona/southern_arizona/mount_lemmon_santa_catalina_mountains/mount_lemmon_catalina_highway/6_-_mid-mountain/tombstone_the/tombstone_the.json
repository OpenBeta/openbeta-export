You don't really use them anyway.\n\n Above the ledge, launch into a 35 foot, skin-tearing, faintly overhanging crux with a ton of cool sequences. After that you will hit a pod/bucket, and do a celebration cruise up the last 10 feet of beautiful holds.\n\n There is a keeper bolt for the belayer just left of dihedral.
