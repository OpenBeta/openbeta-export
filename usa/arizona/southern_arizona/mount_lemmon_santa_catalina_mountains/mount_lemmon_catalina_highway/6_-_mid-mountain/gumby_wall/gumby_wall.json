Morning sun and afternoon shade.Pitch 0: 25 feet. 4th-class slab with 1 bolt. Chain anchors. This anchor can be used for teaching people how to rappel, belay from the top, build/clean anchors, etc. Or link it with Pitch 1. Pitch 1: 100 feet.

Then, start trending up and slightly left on chickenheads/plates until you reach a 2-bolt anchor. This anchor has lower-off biners, in case you want to stop here.

Or you can make an anchor on tricky gear about 10 feet to the left of the 2-bolt anchor, but you'll probably want to eventually transfer the belay to near the bolted anchor for P3 anyway. Pitch 3: 100 feet. From the 2-bolt anchor, climb up and to the right, past 3 bolts, and then scramble up whatever path you want until the climb levels out. Find something natural to belay off of. There are plenty of options.
