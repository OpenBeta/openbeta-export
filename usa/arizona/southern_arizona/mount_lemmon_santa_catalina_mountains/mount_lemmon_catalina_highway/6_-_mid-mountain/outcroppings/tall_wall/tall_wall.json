It is a great place to climb early in the morning during the summer and all day from fall to spring.  Many of the climbs have been done with snow at the base in a light fleece and wind pants.   \n\n  Most of the routes are 195' with chains at 95' and chains at the top.  The routes can all be done as single pitches or in two 95' pitches.  These were the first routes bolted at the area.  The rock is top quality with nice exposure and over 1755' of vertical climbing on this wall.  Bring your quickdraws - you need at least 22 quick draws to these routes in one long pitch!! \n\n  All of these routes require a 60 meter rope.  Danger, don't bring any short ropes here!  Do not belay from the log below the ledge - you will not have enough rope with a 60 meter rope.  Use the safety bolt on the ledge for SWTA, Biaxident and 7 Year Itch"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":11,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:51.768Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:49.125Z"}
