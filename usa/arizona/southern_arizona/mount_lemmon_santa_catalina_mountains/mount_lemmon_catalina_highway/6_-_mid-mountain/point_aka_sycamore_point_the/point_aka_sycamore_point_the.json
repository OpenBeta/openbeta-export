The rock in this area is much like that at Windy Point but steeper and bigger. The complexity and nastiness of the approach has kept development to a null until the hard work of Kenton White developed an approach route under 3.5 hrs. The approach as given below takes about 2.5 hrs and is only moderately brushy. The classic route in the area is Coati Terraces (5.9, 350 ft.) but much solid unclimbed rock awaits development."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:51.763Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:48.900Z"}
