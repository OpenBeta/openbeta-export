He put long slings on the last piece where you could bail to the ledge left, then went out on the face where I climbed on top rope and did the moves.  A fall here would have been nasty.  He then climbed the crack that forms the arete of the upper head wall.  I bolted the line farther left on the steepest part of the head wall.
