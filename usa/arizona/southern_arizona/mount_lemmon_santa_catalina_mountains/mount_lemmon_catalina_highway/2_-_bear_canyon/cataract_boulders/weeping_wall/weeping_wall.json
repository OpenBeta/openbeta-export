It is almost out of place on Mt. Lemmon; it has a unique feel, almost like sandstone. To get there, park at the pullout at MP 9.4 on the left. About 30 feet up the road is a little gulley up the hill. (Note: there is a parking pullout on the right immediately below the gulley) There are two 10-12 foot tall, black and tan cliffs in the gulley a hundred yards up the hill; The Weeping Wall is the upper one. You can see the cliffs from the road, if you look up the gulley. The problems can be bouldered with a few pads and attentive spotters. For toproping, an old bolt of dubious trustworthiness is located 20 feet back from the lip. There are at least five good problems. (Problems listed individually) \n\n  This area doesn't see much traffic, and as such, these routes are really dirty. Ratings are estimate, I haven't climbed them all yet, and the guide I followed didn't have V ratings for all routes. If anyone has more info, please let me know so I can update with more accurate data.  \n\n  I have been informed that this wall is on the right, about halfway up the trail to the Super Secret, Show and Tell Only Area. I'd hate to be the one to give it away or anything, but if you're in the area, this little black wall has some fun problems"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:53.615Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:47.223Z"}
