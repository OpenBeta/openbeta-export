Reach (or jump?) to the obvious, high starting rail and start up the vertical face.  A few moves on the face lead to the beautiful arete.  Follow this past several bolts to the 2 cold shut anchor below the lip. \n\n  The arete contains some of the most technical climbing I've ever done.  There are several heel hooks and even a knee scum possible.  Expect to use both sides of the arete.  The line would merit more stars if it were longer or the rock less gritty.","protection":"5 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor (cold shuts, not chains).","location":"Wu-Tang is located on the backside (uphill side) of Littleland.  Two bolted lines head up the aretes of the attached spire with the boiler plate feature on the downhill side.
