Alex and I had heard it was an old Ringle project and was likely in the 5.13 range. I had looked at it before and we finally decided to go check it out.  \n\n  We were blown away that not only was the climbing interesting and very good, but that the route wasn't nearly as difficult as we were expecting. I replaced the jengus old hardware with fresh stainless and we feel that this abandoned route is now a must do at the crag! \n\n  Randy Cook Lives! has three distinct sections that will keep you guessing with varied moves and holds. Begin with a section of tenuous smears and try to keep ye ole barn door closed until you gain  a large undercling flake. Do a wild and improbable sequence to gain another huge flake. Romp up this to a powerful move with bad feet to gain some cool pockets. Jam, yes hand jam, out the roof to gain some sidepulls and exit the headwall via powerful pulls on crimps.

The wall faces northwest and stays shaded until early afternoon all year.  In April, for example, the crag goes into the sun at 2:30pm. \n\n  The Andy Cook Wall features unique, steep, 5.11 and 5.12 sport routes.  Classics include Rain, with its sustained slightly overhung edging and crimping, and Malt Liquor Man, with its absurd underclings and roofs.  The routes at this wall were added by various parties over the years so the style and the equipment varies from route to route.  Due to the hike and difficulty of the lines it is rare to see other parties at this cliff. \n\n  The routes from left to right are: \n\nClouds (5.12+): Hard moves down low lead to easier climbing above; a decent warmup if you pull past the first move. \n\nRain (5.12): Classic sustained edging.\n\nChest Cracker (5.12-): Climbs right facing corner to face.
