This route was no exception.   \n\n    After some on and off cleaning efforts over a year I finally finished bolting this climb in the spring of 2017.  Initially I thought it would pair nicely with the other low to mid 12s of the area and be of similar difficulty, but during the first runs up the route it became apparent it was much harder.   \n\n     Neon Highway gets real right off the ground with a stout and amazing boulder problem from bolts one to three.  Long moves on sloping rails plus a mini jump deposit you at the base of a giant flake.  Rest up here because difficulties resume as soon as you leave the flake.  Grab amazing sculpted and slippery crimps and faint arete holds as the wall steepens.  If you can make some more long and accurate moves, get fancy with your heels, and manage the long pulls to holds over the lip of the wall.......... you will clip the chains of a fine new addition to the Pumphouse. \n\n     This route is amazing and should not be missed.","protection":"8 bolts to chains with lower-offs","location":"In between Backroad Ballet and Forged in Hell."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ykLv6UByWZ2j8kZmRF0jbg==","name":"Forged in Heels","yds":"5.12a","grades":{"yds":"5.12a","french":"7a+"},"fa":"Luke Bertelsen, Tiffany Bertelsen - 2016","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.69243,32.37349]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"112275666","mp_crag_id":"105957420","climb_id":"ykLv6UByWZ2j8kZmRF0jbg==","areaRef":"+vxS9sOvU5yhY9UaMoao0A=="},"content":{"description":"Follow the first three bolts of Forged in Hell then break right following a right facing corner and flakes. \n\n     This route is named for two very fun and alternating heel and rock over moves in the middle of the route.
