It has characteristics of a classic route: a cool, leaning dihedral and a wild, unique finish.  In many regards it doesn't differ that much from its acclaimed neighbor Two Kings And A Pawn.  Despite its potential this route is damned by its DNA: questionable rock and inconsistent difficulty. \n\n  It should be noted that nothing more than small pebbles came off during my ascent.  Hence the rock may be better than it looks but it certainly caused me to move with trepidation.","protection":"11 bolts to ring anchors.
