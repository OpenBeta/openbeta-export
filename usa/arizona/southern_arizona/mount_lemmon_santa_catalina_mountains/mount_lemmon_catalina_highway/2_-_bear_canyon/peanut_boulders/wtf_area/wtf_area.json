The WTF Boulder is most notoriously recognizable by several pebbles epoxied onto its blank-ish east face.   To get there, hike between the DM and Nacho boulders heading for the wash; stay left out of the thickest brush. After intersecting the wash, turn right, heading back downstream and scramble down between two boulders entering a small flat, gravel-bottomed room. Alternately follow the wash upstream from DM.
