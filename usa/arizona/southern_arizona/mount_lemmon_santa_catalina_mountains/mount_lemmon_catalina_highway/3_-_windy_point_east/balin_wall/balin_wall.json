Atmospherically the crag provides stunning views of Bear Canyon below and Tucson in the distance.  The route itself climbs mostly perfect stone.  Definitely worth the hike on a cool or cloudy day. \n\n  While technically a traditional route, Show of Shows is essentially a sport route.  The one or two token pieces are easy to place and on trivial ground.","protection":"To anchor: 12 bolts and 1 or 2 pieces in the .75 to 2 Camelot range.  The anchor is two bolts and two leaver carabiners.  85 feet. \n\n  To summit: Perhaps another 2 bolts.  Rappel off the back side of the formation.  105 feet. \n\n  I am unsure whether there is an anchor at the summit.  Squeezing The Lemmon III suggests that there is no anchor but I have not confirmed.  If the route does indeed lack an anchor, a new anchor at the summit would be ideal, assuming a 70m route reaches the ground.  Adding chains to the existing two bolt anchor would be sufficient.  The current anchor was a mess of old webbing when I found it.","location":"Show of Shows is located on the southeast face of the Balin Wall.

Climb up the mixed flake/crack with plentiful gear to just under the roof, then traverse left 12' (past a hole with good big stopper and/or smaller full size camming unit) to a belay either below or above the roof. A variation climbs straight off the end of the flake and over the right end of the roof (also 5.8+). Be warned, if you go up 1/2 way through the traverse (above the pro hole), the moves are balancy and steep and could be harder than 5.8+. so the question then begs, go left to get the pro or simply pull straight up over the less than overhanging bulge. With proper runners, the variation from ground to summit can be done with one rope. We belayed above the roof in a 1-1 1/2\" crack. There are a pair of older welded cold shuts at the top. \n\n  A short 45' rap off the back (2 bolts, chains) or downclimb can be done.","protection":"Stoppers or all camming units small to 3\" Doubles of tcu's suggested.","location":"the first route (right side of 1st wall) down the gully."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,f2591e24-8f94-5cb3-9f02-92bfe3f5cd61,74a365ae-142f-5b24-8198-2ac56dfd2922,ac8cf6f7-5920-536f-ba96-c6b2f8e53c64,818f6875-19b9-56ee-a670-d96a50aba92d","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Mount Lemmon (Santa Catalina Mountains)","Mount Lemmon (Catalina Highway)","3 - Windy Point East","Balin Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.71664,32.36547]},"bbox":[-110.71717236229448,32.365020339818145,-110.71610763770553,32.36591966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106339694","area_id":"gY9odRm5Vu6mcNlqUKupLQ=="},"content":{"description":"Sunny typical south facing wall with a few good lines but a long approach for Windy Point.
