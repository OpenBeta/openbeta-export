Start off with fairly easy climbing that gains steadily in difficulty through the first three bolts until a few small holds and a cool formed pinch are encountered.  Clip bolt 4 and start the crux, which involves some very subtle body positioning.  Pull through the the next bolt, cop a quick shake and get ready for the second half of the crux, which is more physical but maintains a high demand for technique. This continues through the next couple of bolts to a slap to a jug where the route joins Catalina 5.11+ to the chains past a couple more bolts on easier terrain. \n\n  This route is all about body positioning and has a plethora of holds that aren't typical for Mount Lemmon like pinches and slopers.  Despite the apparent blankness of the face, this route depends on very few small crimps.","protection":"9 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with chains.","location":"Climbs the center of the obvious, red face on the side of the formation that faces towards Hunchback Pinnacle.
