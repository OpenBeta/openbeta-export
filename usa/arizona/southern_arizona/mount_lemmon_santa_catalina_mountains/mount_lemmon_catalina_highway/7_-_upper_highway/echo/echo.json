You park at Marshall Gulch to get there. The crag faces ENE so you get shade around noon, and it lasts the rest of the day. Plus there is a big pine that provides shade on the middle routes even in the morning depending on time of day/year.This crag is a nice hang and has spectacular views. You can see Raycray to the NE. You can see Ireland across the canyon due east. You can see the Spectrum crags spread out to the SE. You are high up on the west side of the canyon and therefore will catch breezes. You are not far from The Steep and Delta. And it only takes 15 minutes from the parking to get to the crag ! One problem: parking on weekends. Marshall Gulch is a popular place these days, and parking is limited... come early on weekends.The right-side routes are easier and shorter... only about 30 feet. The left-side routes are longer and mostly harder. The crag offers lots of underclings, side-pulls, and other cool features that add a lot of fun.All of the routes have ClimbTech hooks and all have SS bolts at least 3.75 inches in length."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:52.446Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:39.062Z"}
