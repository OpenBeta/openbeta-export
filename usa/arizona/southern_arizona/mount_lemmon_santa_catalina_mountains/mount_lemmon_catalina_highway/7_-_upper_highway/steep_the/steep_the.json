And now the anchor has the awesome ClimbTech Mussys.\n\n - Added a bolt so that if you blow the balancy clip at the last bolt below the NEW anchor you don't pay a horrible price.\n\n - Pounded a wood wedge into the inverted-v crack that was grabbing and trying to shred the rope. Put a glob of epoxy putty right under the wood.  That should be a permanent fix.\n\n - Moved the 1st bolt up so it actually protects the opening move and would be better on the rope and belayer if you fall on the cruxy opening move.  Stick clip of 1st bolt is a reasonable thing in the new configuration.\n\n - Lowered the 2nd bolt so you are not looking at groundfall.\n\n - Added a bolt so you don't slam the slab if you fall above the 2nd bolt.\n\n - Moved Tony's old 3rd bolt (becomes my 4th) 2 feet left to where it should have been all along.\n\n Brian Zittlosen and Josie Wodraska helped with this fixup project.\n\n ------------------------------------------------\n\n This route is now as good as any other 5.11 at the crag.  It compares pretty well to any 5.11 in the Upper Highway area.

Lemmon because its summit is reachable only by technical means. You can solo after the Two Birds anchor or do a 2nd sparsely-protected pitch of Spiderman to get to the top.\n\n Historical note: the existence of this crag was known back in the early 1980s. But bad rock and lack of protectable lines relegated it to the forget-about-it zone. Tony Lusk was the first to view it through the eyes of a sport developer. It still required a lot of work and cleaning though. Cres Snyder probably contributed more than anyone to the cleanup effort."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":23,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:52.439Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:06.919Z"}
