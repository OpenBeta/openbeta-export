Expect a fair amount of debris on other parts of the boulder. The Boulder is East facing and is in the shade by early afternoon.    There are two Pines at the top that are usable for Top Roping any part of the boulder. Belay/spotter will be standing in the road, but it is currently closed for construction and does not recieve much traffic anyways."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:52.440Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:44.173Z"}
