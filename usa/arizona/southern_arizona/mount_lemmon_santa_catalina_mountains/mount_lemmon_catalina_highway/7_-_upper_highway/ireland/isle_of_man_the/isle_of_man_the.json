Starting up the clean face, interesting movement on unique holds (including a natural 4 finger pocket and a thumb wrap crimp) leads to the break with a sloping crimp rail.  Pull through the next section (formerly the crux) and stay left of the bolt line for continuous, fun movement on pinches and gastons to a 2 bolt anchor shared with Mann's Arete. \n\n  The panel after the break was the crux, involving a hard stand up into a 2 finger half-pad sidepull/undecling knob, a big reach to a blade crimp, and a long deadpoint to a slopey jug.  Unfortunately, despite 6 or 7 toprope burns determining where the line goes, I apparently missed a crimp in this section, reducing a very hard and unique sequence into a boring 5.10 haul (and dropping the grade from 12+ to 12a, so I'm told).  Regardless, it is still the best line on the Isle of Man to date.","protection":"6 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor with chains.
