This sequence culminates in difficult moves to and from an absolutely heinous 2 finger crimp that will challenge preconceived notions of the word \"hold\".  \n\n  A monster deadpoint spits you out onto the best hold in the first 50 ft of the route, a good 3-4 finger mini horn. Launch again into a slightly less difficult boulder problem and execute a technical traverse. Switch gears and keep it together for the final (slightly easier still) boulder problem involving powerful moves on a pinch/undercling and slaps to big, open handed holds. Surf it out through jug city and mantel the ledge to glory.  \n\n  This is a power endurance route. The 50 feet of business is super sustained with nothing to match and only a few places that its even conceivable to chalk or get a quick shake. \n\n  Very different from anything in its grade range, this route requires some serious savagery and is a Lemmon hard-man classic.","protection":"7 bolts","location":"Between Infrared Heart and The Sampler"},"__v":0},{"_id":"+0WcZirpUvm9DRHapc/TVA==","name":"Battle of the Bulge","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"Joe Shiefman, Joe Kreidel, Galen","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.74986,32.41701]},"left_right_index":8,"mp_id":"108836934","mp_crag_id":"108833777","climb_id":"+0WcZirpUvm9DRHapc/TVA==","areaRef":"2oUKAXDPV3iS1Vwm1L/56w=="},"content":{"description":"Located between the Thief and Central Limit.
