The location was pretty remote with a beautiful view of the San Pedro River Valley and there was no evidence of anyone having been there before. I talked Joe Kreidel into taking a look at the crag, but we never got back before he moved to San Antonio. Fortunately for me, in November of last year, I was able to convince John Baker to take a look and we top roped a couple of routes on the east side. This convinced us that it would be worth developing the crag. Josie Wodraska soon joined in on the crag development. There are now 12 routes from 5.10- to 5.12 with the possibility for a few more. The area is comprised of three main towers with routes facing to the east, north, and west. The base is still a little unstable, especially on the west side. As such, a couple of the routes have keeper bolts to protect the climbers. All the routes were covered in lichen, and even after much cleaning, would benefit from a little more brushing. The elevation is about 7,200’, so even when chasing shade it might feel warm when the temps in town pass 100 (unless it’s windy)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:52.439Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:49.650Z"}
