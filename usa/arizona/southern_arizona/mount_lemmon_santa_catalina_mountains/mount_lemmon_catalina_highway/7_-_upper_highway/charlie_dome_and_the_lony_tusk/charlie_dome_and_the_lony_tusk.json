We found a few bolts already there, and assumed that Tony Lusk had been there already.  No big surprise. \n\n  I went back in 2012 with Joe Shiefman and Jeremy Parks.  We did a couple of Tony's routes and put up a few more. \n\n  The routes are not fantastic but they are pretty good and it's a cool spot.  You will find solitude there... it's too far off the track to see anyone else.  AND...Lust In The Dust, Ivory Tower, Master Debater and Double Or Nothing have deep morning shade. \n\n  The Lony Tusk is yet another crag in the upper Sabino area that requires technical climbing to reach the summit.
