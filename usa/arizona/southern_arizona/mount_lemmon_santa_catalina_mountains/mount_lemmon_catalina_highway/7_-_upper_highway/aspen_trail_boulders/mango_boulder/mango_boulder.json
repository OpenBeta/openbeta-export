It is in the shade in the afternoon. The wall is blocky and steep; it overhangs from 10 to 45 degrees, and has the highest concentration of steep problems in Tucson. There are tons of holds on the wall, so in addition to the problems mentioned here, there are a plethora of eliminates to do. You are only as limited as your imagination.
