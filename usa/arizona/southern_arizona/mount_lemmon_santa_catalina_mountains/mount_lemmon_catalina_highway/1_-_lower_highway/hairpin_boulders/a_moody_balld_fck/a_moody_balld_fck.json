The loose rock needs to be cleaned up for sure so I was going to get on that.  There is a huge boulder sitting up there waiting to crush somebody one day.  It looks like somebody may have been sleeping under this at some point so I need to get up there with a trash bag and in general this boulder is at least as big of a mess as I am.  All the same, I'm attached to it so I'm gonna spend some time working on it attached to a rope and if I'm not crushed to death or blinded by all the dirt falling in my eyes it should be fun.","protection":"Still working this out but pads and a spotter may not cut it on this one.
