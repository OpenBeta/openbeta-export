When you climb 5.11s, 5.5 seems like walking up a flight of stairs but when you're new to climbing or a little kid a 65 foot 5.5 seems like a thousand feet of overhung crimpers.  It's also tough to give directions when you have to shout them from 50 feet away.  So instead of complaining and doing nothing this is the first of my solutions. \n\n  This is a 20+ foot slab, easy climbing (but still slab) and there are two fresh bolts I just put in on the top.  You will need a 24\" sling to set up top rope as two draws won't do it.  I don't know if they will get used much and but they're out of sight and there if you want them. \n\n  This would also be an ideal spot for showing somebody how to clean anchors as you can safely sit right there and show them.
