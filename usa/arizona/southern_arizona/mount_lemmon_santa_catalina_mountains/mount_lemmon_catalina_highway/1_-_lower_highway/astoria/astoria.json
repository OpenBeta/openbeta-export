At first I figured I would just leave it alone as it's a little too high to boulder and a little short to bolt.  It kept popping into my head though, I really liked many of the holds and moves and found myself going back.  On days where I was short on time but still wanted to get on the rock I would head up there because it was low on the mountain, had a short approach and I needed nothing more then two quick-draws and a half rope so I could pack light. \n\n  Astoria is perfect for people with a fear of heights, somebody that needs a fairly gentle approach, a person that wants to climb outside but isn't leading or to show new climbers the ropes including how to clean anchors. \n\n  Don't be fooled however, there are some tough moves to be found here that are a nice deviation from the normal stuff you find on Lemmon including a ton of side pulls. If you're leading 5.11s this area will bore you but if you want a change of pace, mellow climbing or an area to introduce people to climbing this is ideal. You also can't beat the summer shade, winter sun, amazing views and if you can't handle being without your phone you even have cell reception (which is a negative to me). \n\n  While I wouldn't call the climbing child friendly (5.5) climbing, the area and approach are virtually free of hazards.\n\n This is a work in progress so I will be adding to this over the next week or two as I get the lines up.\n\n "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":8,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:55.678Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:42.804Z"}
