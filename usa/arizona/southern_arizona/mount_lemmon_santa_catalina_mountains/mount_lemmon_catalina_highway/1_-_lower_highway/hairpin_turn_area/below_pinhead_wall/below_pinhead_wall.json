Starting position is not as obvious, which detracts quality. That said, the low start adds additional pump and challenge in a bouldering style that is relative unique in the area. You may need to build out the landing if water levels are high. The boulder is probably V8/9, but given the non-trivial approach and landing that will likely need rebuilding, I hope the soft 9 will encourage people to come and try it. ","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,f2591e24-8f94-5cb3-9f02-92bfe3f5cd61,74a365ae-142f-5b24-8198-2ac56dfd2922,fe5feef6-3d7a-5be3-ac07-5a27dec28b23,59b19151-6daa-50ad-ab57-8cd3f5752cab,c01e4309-fafb-560c-9166-15b182335a89","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Mount Lemmon (Santa Catalina Mountains)","Mount Lemmon (Catalina Highway)","1 -  Lower Highway","Hairpin Turn Area","Below pinhead wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"},{"count":1,"label":"V11-12"},{"count":1,"label":"V9"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":3}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":3}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.74201,32.3166]},"bbox":[-110.74254207486278,32.316150339818144,-110.74147792513723,32.31704966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121951957","area_id":"wB5DCfr7VgyRZhWxgjNaiQ=="},"content":{"description":"Area of water polished bouldering just after hiking down from the pinhead wall area"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:57.867Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:44.728Z"}
