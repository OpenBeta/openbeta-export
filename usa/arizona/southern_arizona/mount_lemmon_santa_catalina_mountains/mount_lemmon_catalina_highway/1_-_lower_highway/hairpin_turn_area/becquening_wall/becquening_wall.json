When he picked up the sport again he was more interested in establishing new, moderate and beginner friendly areas than finishing up old projects.\n\n Eric Fazio-Rhicard and Greg Kay revisited the wall in spring 2019 and re-climbed a few of the routes and thought, with a hardware upgrade, this orphan line could work out. Eric gave me a call and lured me off the couch long enough to help re-bolt and red point the line.\n\n It's no 4 star classic, but it's fun.
