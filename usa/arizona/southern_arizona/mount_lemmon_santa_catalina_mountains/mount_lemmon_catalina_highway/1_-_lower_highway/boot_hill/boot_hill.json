Its a pumpy vertical to slightly overhung face with thin ledges for feet and hands and bomber hand holds right where and when you need them.  Turn right at the top of the trail and look for an obvious west facing triangular face (narrow on the bottom and wider at the top) with two sets of chains in the middle and the left top.  There is a slab on the right side of the route.  Boulder up the slab to clip the first bolt, then step across onto the face, or back down and do it from the bottom with a TR from the first bolt.  Resist the urge to go straight up from the bottom on lead - it is 10a/b moves on very questionable rock.  Follow the bolts, staying mostly to the right.

It appears in \"Squeezing the Lemmon\" on page 135 with a handful of routes developed in 1989 by Doug Lantz and Diane Vetter. More recently (since July 2004), the crag has been adopted and developed by Andy Peter and Steve Kanoza. They have added 29 new routes (5.5 to 5.11), mostly sport and mixed routes with chains or Metolius rap hangers. The rock varies from crumbly to solid - test the holds and watch out for rockfall. The routes are mostly on the north and west faces, so most routes are shady most of the day, but some sunshine can be had in the afternoon. The low elevation and shade should mean comfortable temps for early Spring and late Fall days as well as warm Winter days."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":34,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:55.678Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:42.789Z"}
