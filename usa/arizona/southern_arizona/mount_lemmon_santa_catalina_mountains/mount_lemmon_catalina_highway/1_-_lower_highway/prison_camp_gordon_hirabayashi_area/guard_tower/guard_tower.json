It is presently the only climb on the wall and can easily be recognized by having two sets of chains up top.  The route is very steep, even overhanging at points, but with big jugs at almost every move. Short and fun.  Beware of falling early and hitting the rock ledge at the bottom of the climb.  Also, some of the larger holds look like they might not last forever, so beware of those too.","protection":"This route has four bolts, and not one, but two sets of anchors!","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"WRsF1mR/Wg+c68MN4LOghw==","name":"Probation","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Ben Burnham 1999","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.72474,32.33359]},"left_right_index":24,"mp_id":"105738317","mp_crag_id":"108568745","climb_id":"WRsF1mR/Wg+c68MN4LOghw==","areaRef":"V5BMhSIAXfWxgZjZGHKezg=="},"content":{"description":"Probation climbs the cracks and corners at the left-hand side of the \"Guard Tower\".

The Guard Tower is opposite this, with climbs starting 15 ft. out of the creek bottom.  Probation is an easy route up the vegetated and somewhat grungy cracks on the left side of the wall.
