The upper dihedral is the crux and protects on nested thin nuts until the crack widens (RPs may work well, but I forgot them and managed to make it safe).  Belay above the short chimney.  The second pitch climbs 180 feet of nice chimney (5.7ish).  The chimney can be stemmed and face climbed, and protects with an assortment of gear outside the chimney.
