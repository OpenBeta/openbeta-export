Fun edging on routes from 40 to 80 feet long.  At the south end is a leaning pillar where those looking for a little more sting will find it.  As usual with these newer areas the rock leaves a little to be desired but it is mostly small stuff that will clean up with the passage of climbers.  Occasionally your quickdraw will bang against the wall and give off a hollow sound as if it is in bad rock.  It isn't in bad rock.  The bolt is in good stuff but the rock below might have a little veneer that could give you pause but the bolts are in good stuff. \n\n  The first routes were put up in a pretty stiff breeze and when a loose flake was removed a number of bark scorpions were lifted up towards Jimbo as he hung from the top-rope.
