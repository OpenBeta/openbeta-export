It is kind of an interesting lead with a lot of stemming and little OW.  The pro is thin until you reach the bottom of the crack, at which point you will spend a lot of time looking in little nooks and crannies for the best place to put pro.  There is a large wedged boulder on top that can be slung for an anchor.  Scramble off down a sandy chimney and walk back around to the base of the crag.","protection":"A wide assortment of pro.
