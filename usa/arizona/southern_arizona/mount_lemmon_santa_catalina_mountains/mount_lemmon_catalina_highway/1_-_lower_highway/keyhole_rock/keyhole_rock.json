Climb up thru the wide crack to a sloping ledge. Angle right at first until you can diagonal back left into a long, left-diagonalling flake/crack system. Clip a bolt as you lieback up to a 2- bolt semi-hanging belay.  (5.8  100')  \n\n  2. Traverse right along the horizontal crack. Head up then right again past a bolt to a thin flake, then up past another bolt into a juggy, steep section. A crack splits the next face above. Climb along that to the right of an old nest and finish in the cracks that break up the face above. It stays steep right to the end. Belay from 2 bolts.

Rap 90' to the ground.","location":"Park on the  Mt. Lemmon Highway, approximately MP 5.8, at the very next drainage after the Molino Canyon Campground turnoff. There is a dirt pullout right before the drainage  on the right side of the road. After about a hundred feet up the canyon (Harlan Canyon?) look for the biggest thumb of rock on the left slope , way back by the waterfall.  Hike the drainage for about 20-30 minutes until you can cut up the steep slope to the left,  just before the big waterfall.  The climb starts in a left-facing corner that turns to a crack. This is about 30 feet up left from the oak tree at the lowest toe of the rock."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,f2591e24-8f94-5cb3-9f02-92bfe3f5cd61,74a365ae-142f-5b24-8198-2ac56dfd2922,fe5feef6-3d7a-5be3-ac07-5a27dec28b23,88370775-7716-5318-b40b-7a1c5b870622","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Mount Lemmon (Santa Catalina Mountains)","Mount Lemmon (Catalina Highway)","1 -  Lower Highway","Keyhole Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.69321,32.34108]},"bbox":[-110.69374221875609,32.34063033981815,-110.69267778124392,32.34152966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112443518","area_id":"iDcHdXcWUxi0C3ocW4cGIg=="},"content":{"description":"Secluded,south-facing rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:55.670Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:42.508Z"}
