A little thrutchy for a move or two then fun with a really cool move to turn the end of the roof. From here it climbs over moderate rock to a short hanging corner. More moderate cruising leads to a deceptively stout finish sequence to jugs above the anchors. The rock is a little less than perfect at the bottom but a lot of bolts make it less nerve racking. This will eventually clean up and be even less of an issue.","protection":"12 draws needed and not those silly six inch things, 8 inches or longer, length does matter on this climb.
