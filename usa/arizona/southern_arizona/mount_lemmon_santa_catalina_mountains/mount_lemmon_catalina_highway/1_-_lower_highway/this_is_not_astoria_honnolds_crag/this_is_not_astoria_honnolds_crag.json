I struggled off and on for almost 10 seconds on what to do with this area. I initially thought that I would just take a leak and leave to go look for the real Astoria, but then I realized there were a couple of decent lines here, if you're standards are low, that is. It's short; shorter than the real Astoria, but you can walk-off just like at the real Astoria. The rock is (somewhat) friable, but hey, some people purposefully seek perverse challenges of just that sort - you've heard of Layton Kor, right? This area is perfect for those kind of lunatics, er... rugged, hardmen/women. It's easy to get to, easier than the real Astoria, but for the lack of a trail. There are 2 existing routes there at the time of this writing (2020-06-15), and since I put both of them up on free solo, you can never climb them in any other style. We must always preserve the experience of the first ascensionist, true?"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:54.945Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:49.175Z"}
