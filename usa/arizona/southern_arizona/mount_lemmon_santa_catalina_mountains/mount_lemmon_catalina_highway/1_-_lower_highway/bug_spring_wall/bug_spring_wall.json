Two cruxes: first one pulling through the second bolt (balancy and technichal), the other from the 4th to 5th bolt.  There's a runout between bolts 3 & 4 on very easy ground and you clip the 4th bolt from a huge ledge (so it's pretty tame and you could get gear if you wanted it). Above this ledge, there are two distinct lines to climb, both about at the same grade: go left of the bolts into a short crack (a hand jam is helpful) and then up to really nice holds and a good clipping stance, OR go right of the bolts on the face using crimps and a few jugs.  Right is more sustained and the clipping stance isn't as comfy, but it's fun face climbing. \n\n  Edited: The FA party brought a big crowbar up and pulled on the partially detached block and couldn't move it.  It's well attached on one half and solid, even though it sounds hollow. I'm not great at grading climbs, so this may be anywhere from 5.9 to 10b.  \n\n  A good route that's got more challenging climbing than the other 5.9 climb I did in the area.
