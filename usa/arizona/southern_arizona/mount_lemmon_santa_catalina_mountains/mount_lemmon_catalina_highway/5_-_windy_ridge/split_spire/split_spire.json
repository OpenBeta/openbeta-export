The real crux here is avoiding the choss, since the whole rock is pretty grainy and the placements aren't very bomber.   Definitely bring some cordelette to rap/lower off the 2 rusty bolts on top. The spacing of these two bolts gives an incredibly strong rope drag for all of the climbs on this tower.   No info on the chopped bolt line on the right side of the spire, but would be greatly appreciated if anyone knows anything about it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:50.544Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:04.954Z"}
