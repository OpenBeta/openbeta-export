The left side of the crag consists of bouldery, overhung lines starting at 5.11.  This section of the crag stays shaded until 3pm.  The middle of the crag features a trilogy of classic, vertical, friction routes: War Of The Worlds, The Planet Eater, and Premonition.  The right side is marked by long less-than-vertical pitches and sees sun earlier, at perhaps 11am.  Conditions are best during the spring and fall months; however, it is possible to climb the left hand routes during the summer.  Some routes have high quality second and third pitches; some require a second rope to descend.  There is cell phone reception (Verizon, April 2016)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:50.548Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:36.353Z"}
