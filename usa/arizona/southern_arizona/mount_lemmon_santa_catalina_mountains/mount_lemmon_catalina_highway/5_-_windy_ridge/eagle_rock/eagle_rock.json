Lemmon.  I can't remember why it's done as 2 pitches, maybe because of a big ledge half way up.\n\n From Sam: P1: Starts in an overhanging right-facing dihedral finger crack, then you get a short but nice offwidth section, then finish with some fist jams to top out on a big ledge.  Belay off tree.P2: finger crack starts about chest-height, then gradually widens to fists up to a rest ledge, then you have the option of going straight up to more offwidth or move right to hand/fist crack.  Nice big belay tree up top.  Walk off.You definitely want to to this as two short pitches; there are rope-snagging boulders at the top of the first pitch which would thwart linking them together.  Most sections require actual jamming and crack technique, though you can get away with liebacking a lot of it.  Granite is sharp and grainy, tape or gloves recommended.","protection":"Sam: Cams up to Camelot #4, a #5 is nice  to have for the offwidth sections but optional, doubles if you want to sew it up.  Nut placements to be had in the finger crack sections.","location":"On the right side of the area.  An attractive crack start."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,f2591e24-8f94-5cb3-9f02-92bfe3f5cd61,74a365ae-142f-5b24-8198-2ac56dfd2922,24a29fdf-43b1-5377-97b3-c158e26328bd,6e4de00a-01c8-585a-a47d-e22b11d110ff","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Mount Lemmon (Santa Catalina Mountains)","Mount Lemmon (Catalina Highway)","5 - Windy Ridge","Eagle Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.70216,32.37551]},"bbox":[-110.70269242143172,32.375060339818134,-110.70162757856826,32.37595966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114984668","area_id":"bk3gCgHIWFqkfeIrEdEQ/w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.70269242143172,32.375060339818134],[-110.70162757856826,32.375060339818134],[-110.70162757856826,32.37595966018186],[-110.70269242143172,32.37595966018186],[-110.70269242143172,32.375060339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"Sunny espec in morning."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:51.145Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:05.868Z"}
