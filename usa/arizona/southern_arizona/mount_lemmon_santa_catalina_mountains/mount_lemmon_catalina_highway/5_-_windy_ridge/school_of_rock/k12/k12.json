It is on a neck-like formation. We agreed that this must be what he was referring to in his old guide. It is now a sport route called \"Smartest Dumb Guy On Earth\"... 5.7) Steiger said \"5.6\" and \"if you must\" for Swan's neck.  The only other routes in this area mentioned in Steiger's guide are: Phallus 5.8 R (now called South Ridge) and Magic Mushroom March 5.6 X.  These routes are NOT on K12. MIAfter we did a few routes on the sunny SE face of K12, we turned our attention to the NW side. I assumed that I was the first person on top of this pinnacle, but as I was drilling a TR anchor for Hot For Teacher I found 2 ancient 1/4 inch bolts nearby.  Someone had tried to TR the route (or something like it) 40 or more years ago !  Looking down I could also see a 1/4 incher on top of the pillar about halfway up Studly Haul.  Who did this and when ?  I asked Ray Ringle when he was out checking our work and he had no knowledge or memory of this area at all.  Maybe Steiger will chime in."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:51.143Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:47.917Z"}
