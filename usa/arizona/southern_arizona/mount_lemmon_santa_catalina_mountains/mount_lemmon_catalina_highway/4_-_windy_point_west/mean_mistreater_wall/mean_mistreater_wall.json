For the most part, the ethic for first ascents was still from the ground up, but somewhat newly invented Fire rubber, RPs, and friends -- and a willingness to fall, sometimes a long way -- allowed us to be a little more aggressive than in years past.  The epitome of climbing, for a number of us locals of that era, was launching up a virgin face broken by incipient weaknesses, with little idea of the outcome, but faith that sooner or later some pro would appear -- and if not, at least some feature to drill from.
