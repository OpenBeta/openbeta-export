There are likely many more problems to be found, depending on how far uphill you are willing to walk.

Still it's a nice place to spend a day when temps are right.  \n\n  Gate's Pass provides a great opportunity to climb in a true Sonoran Desert setting, among some of the best saguaro stands in the world.  It is also thick with evil jumping cholla and rattlesnakes, so be extra careful, especially with pets around.  Don't forget to stick around for the sunset!  \n\n  For a topo and handful of established problems, see the Arizona section atdrtopo.com.  Photos can be viewed attucsonbouldering.com.
