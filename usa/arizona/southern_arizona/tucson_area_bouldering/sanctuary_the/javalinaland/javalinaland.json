Features are present but far apart which may result in a few very hard problems. A more reasonable problem may start around to the right near two pockets and work up to the left just under the lip to a sloping top-out near the first cleft. The shorter boulder forming the left side of the A-frame cave has two short but good problems: the arete and face just right of it. The \"locals\" have been using this cave as a toilet for eons resulting in a pleasant aroma in warmer months. Not as bad when its cold.  \n\n  On the uphill (east) side of the boulder, several eliminates and variations make for good warm-ups. \n\n   V0 The face by the palo verde branch. 12ft.
