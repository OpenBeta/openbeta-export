It's a very nice, large boulder with a good number of problems on it, the area is very peaceful, it's ideal for winter bouldering and there's enough to do and explore in the area to easily make a half a day out of the adventure. \n\n  There is one bolt on the top of the boulder, looks like a pretty old home made hanger if I recall correctly.  This is a large boulder so I would recommend a couple pads and good spotters. \n\n  If you have any additional information post a comment on it and I'll do an edit."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:49.264Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:02.619Z"}
