Hidden behind Elephant Dome, Pangaea Wall faces south toward the drainage separating it from Table Dome. The drainage has created growth that makes the approach more difficult but also trees large enough to provide shade at the base of the routes. \n\n  The most well known route on the rock is Song of Pangea (5.9, A2) which climbs through the large roof in 5 pitches. Unemployment Blues (5.8) climbs the obvious left facing corner and offers a less committing choice with bolted rap stations (no chains) at the top of both pitches. \n\n  To descend from the top of the formation traverse right and scramble down a 4th class gully to a large ledge. This is the top Unemployment Blues, two 50m rappels will reach the ground from here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:02.879Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:49.832Z"}
