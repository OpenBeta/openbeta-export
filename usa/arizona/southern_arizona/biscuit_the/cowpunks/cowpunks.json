Anyways they can't climb.\n\n This is a fun climb. After the weird box feature in the obvious rock scar, there is a bit of crimping, and a fun throw to sinker pocket (if you know where it is).

It really broke my heart. Eventually I figured out how to pull the rock off of it, and it rattled at me and crawled under a rock. About a month later we flipped the rock and... no snake. So maybe it lives on, but I'd be surprised. The moral is, be more careful, because the rock isn't yours (nor mine).\n\n This is a fun route with some soft rock because the crystal pockets are a little thin in places. There is a also a bottomless dirt hole that you have to use. I will try and clean it out soon. That said, almost the whole route travels through huge holes and pockets, and it's pretty cool. At the chains you can see through the gap between the Biscuit and the Galleta off towards the Whetstones.","protection":"Maybe 10 bolts.
