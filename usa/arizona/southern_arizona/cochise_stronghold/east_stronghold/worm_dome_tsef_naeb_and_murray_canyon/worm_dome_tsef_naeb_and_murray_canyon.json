The climb is fun and wild, but is marred by much easier climbing following an extremely difficult start as well as the dike itself which is hollow in places and rather scary.\n\n Begin the route by climbing up a dead tree that appears to have naturally fallen into position (though it could be climber-engineered). Clip the first bolt and perform a difficult move (5.11). Without this tree, the first 15' of climbing are surely much harder. Expect a long run between the third and fourth bolts (though the climbing is easy), and again between the fourth and fifth. Fixed anchor.\n\n The route is unusual and fun, but I couldn't quite call it great. So two stars - but worth a trip if you have a short day up at Rockfellow.\n\n Mangas Coloradas was an Apache chief and warrior who suffered terrible injustice and ultimatelyÂ death when he met with US forces to negotiate peace and was promptly detained, tortured, and executed. His body was then mutilated and never returned to the Apache people. He was also Cochise's father-in-law.","protection":"7 bolts plus the anchor.
