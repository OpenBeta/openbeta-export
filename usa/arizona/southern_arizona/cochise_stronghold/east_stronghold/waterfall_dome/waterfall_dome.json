At the top of the flake traverse, on easy friction, diagonally leftward for about 40'or so, passing below a series of small, downward-facing ledges to access a second robust, rightward-facing flake. Climb the face to the right of the flake to its terminus for about 50'. From here there is an obvious line of knobs and plates surrounding a prominent groove, leading upward past a series of small, leftward-facing flakes for about 75' to a smallish, round boulder with a half-dead shrub and into a boulder filled gully. 3rd-class the gully until it exits a short distance below the summit.
