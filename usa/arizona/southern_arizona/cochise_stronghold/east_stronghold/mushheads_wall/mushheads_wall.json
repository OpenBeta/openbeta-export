Any moves near the grade are well protected. Both pitches are great but the first is the main event, with that being said the moves off the anchor on the second will hold your attention! A great route close to the car and shady for those hot days!  Pitch 1: start up a small slab to a mossy corner, make a awkward yet well protected move out of the corner. Head up the chimney and once you are on top of the pillar clip a bolt. The direct moves probably go at 11c (haven't done them yet) but if you look around there are 5.10 moves to get you onto the face. follow the crack above the bolt, using it and plates to ascend the wall. The crack continues to another bolt moving up and left to another crack that will lead you to a shelf. Make another one or two tough moves to gain the shelf and two bolt anchor. Pitch 2: from the anchor head pretty much straight up finding a few small pieces before making a deceivingly tough move. Hard 5.9 maybe 5.10? Above this follow plates and heads for a few moves up and to the left. As you start to near the summit the dome rounds out and turns slaby. Continue up and left through one or two shelves to the summit. once on the summit find a spot to build anchor  ","protection":"full rack of wires to medium including brass, double .2-2 single 3","location":"left side of the wall, find the pillar that forms the chimney on pitch one. the route starts below this."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,d89ead8f-ea94-5fc1-9170-13bf8dd94398,f7b7a2a3-7804-5412-ac59-8fc77a66751b,dea79812-f0ba-5c81-9550-60666d3e09af","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Cochise Stronghold","East Stronghold","Mushheads Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.96408,31.94462]},"bbox":[-109.9646099097702,31.944170339818143,-109.96355009022979,31.94506966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121779893","area_id":"3qeYEvC6XIGVUGBmbT4Jrw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.9646099097702,31.944170339818143],[-109.96355009022979,31.944170339818143],[-109.96355009022979,31.94506966018187],[-109.9646099097702,31.94506966018187],[-109.9646099097702,31.944170339818143]]]}},"content":{"description":"A 300ft north-facing wall that sits across from Entrance Dome."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:59.744Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:58.031Z"}
