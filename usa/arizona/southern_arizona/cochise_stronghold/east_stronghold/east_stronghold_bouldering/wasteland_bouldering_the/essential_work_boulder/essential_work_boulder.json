Start low in roof with right hand on flat, laser cut undercling, and left on lowest part of sloper rail.

There could be a few variations in the end, and a potential low start.","protection":"6-8 pads, if you do not move during climb","location":"Start low in cave."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,d89ead8f-ea94-5fc1-9170-13bf8dd94398,f7b7a2a3-7804-5412-ac59-8fc77a66751b,ed592702-cdb9-5dcd-b261-911df9e3ec8c,7a740fee-da33-5854-88fc-d1e088bb34b1,376a987b-a8ca-556f-bea6-f16c041f44d3","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Cochise Stronghold","East Stronghold","East Stronghold Bouldering","Wasteland Bouldering, The","Essential Work Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.97037,31.94113]},"bbox":[-109.97089988964585,31.94068033981815,-109.96984011035416,31.941579660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120233373","area_id":"N2qYe6jKVW++pvFsBB9E0w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.97089988964585,31.94068033981815],[-109.96984011035416,31.94068033981815],[-109.96984011035416,31.941579660181866],[-109.97089988964585,31.941579660181866],[-109.97089988964585,31.94068033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":"Amazing, 30 foot roof"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:01.595Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:18.926Z"}
