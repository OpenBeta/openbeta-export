Start in the middle of the slab and figure a way to go roughly straight up, eventually topping out on the pinnacle of the face. Getting off the ground is the physical challenge, and those who meet the task will face the mental trial: a last commiting sequence with 6 feet to the lip. Luckily there is a option to bail out right for those who get cold feet. Obviously this was not a first ascent, and maybe not the first ascent without a rope. Possibly the first ascent in true bouldering style: working ground up.
