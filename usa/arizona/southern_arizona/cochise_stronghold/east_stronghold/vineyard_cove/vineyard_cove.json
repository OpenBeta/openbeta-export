It's in the shade til 9 am or so and has shade again by 2:30 pm (so it's very bearable climbing even in the hottest months)\n\n It is best found by turning right into the \"84b\" free camping area of the NF (National Forest) It's basically the second right after the wooden NF sign on the main road into the Stronghold. If you take the first right (\"84a\") just follow that dirt road around until it almost reaches the main gravel road again. Find a fence with an open gate under trees and park here. A level trail (1 minute approach) will take you to the wall.\n\n The alcove wall features 3 chain anchors, but only the middle route (\"Jacob's Ladder\", the longest route at about 60 feet, is bolted. The other two climbs can be easily set up as top-ropes by lowering off \"Jacob's Ladder\" 's chains and swinging either right or left. (Outside the alcove to the right is \"Camper's Delight\") Print out the Beta Photo.\n\n The climbs, from left to right: 1)\"Di-vine Inspiration\" (5.10d) A very challenging finger crack system with a stiff 10 start that mildly eases up as it heads up to the anchors.\n\n 2)\"Di-vine Connection\" (5.10) A couple variations at the start.
