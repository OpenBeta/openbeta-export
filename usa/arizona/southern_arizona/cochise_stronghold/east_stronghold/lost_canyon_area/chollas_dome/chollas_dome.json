This is on the south face. The crux can be bypassed to make the climb go at 5.7.P1: Begin right of the brown stain and follow 4 bolts to a chickenhead and lower angle slab. Continue up 2 more bolts to an anchor. 5.7 100 feet, 6 bolts. P2: Step right into the water stain/groove. Clip a bolt and continue onto a ledge. From here, the direct route stays in the water groove for a move or two of 5.8 (5.9?) slab climbing. It is possible to bypass this section at 5.7 by heading up the ledge to the left a bit before using a rail for hands to come back right. More face climbing leads to the summit and an anchor. 5.8+/5.7 80 feet, 5 bolts.Two 100 foot raps get you down. ","protection":"Bolts and perhaps a couple slings. 6 draws should do it. Bolted anchors.","location":"Located on the left side of the dome as viewed from the Lost Canyon Trail. This would be the South face. Begin near the top of the gully that divides Polychrome and Cholla Domes. Locate the very obvious brown water streak/groove.
