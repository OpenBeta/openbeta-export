Sorry Mike! The start jugs are on the backside of the boulder at the end of the tunnel. Use these to pull into the shitty feet and fists. Use your best awkward fist and hand jamming technique to head feet first through the tunnel. Get your feet way above your head and pull that lip move with some tasty chicken wings.","protection":"Boulder pad, two spotters would be nice for the somewhat scary start","location":"Slide down the water polished granite and into the hole between two boulders leaning against each other. The hand and fist crack through the tunnel is the route. Crawl through the tunnel and start on the obvious jugs. Your upper body will be suspended fairly high off the ground at this start, with your lower body inside the tunnel, so a spotter would be ideal. Could be started from either direction, but I was only able to make the moves from the jug start with the drop off below it.
