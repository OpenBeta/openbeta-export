When it peters out look a bit higher for a 2-bolt anchor to the left. 100ftP2 - Continue straight up on a relatively easy face past 2 bolts and scant options for protection until you reach a 2 bolt anchor about 30' below the face and right corner of upper 'headwall'. 100ftP3 - Aim for the right corner of the huge block where the two formations meet. Make a few spicy moves up this corner to a high bolt up and left on top of the block. Make sure to find this bolt before starting up the corner and clip it before moving onto the top of the block. Follow the face for a few bolts trending up and left. Build a gear anchor at the base of the slab in the boulders at the right side of the ledge or use the bolted anchors (these belong to the next route left). 100ftP4 - Follow the steeper slabby face at the right edge of the ledge past 5 bolts and a couple options for gear.
