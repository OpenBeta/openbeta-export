It is a fairly easy climb that can be divided into two pitches.  It takes all pro's if you start underneath the roof on the first pitch or if you start on Elyssa the Rowan, which it shares both anchors with, it can be a mixed route.  On the second pitch, start traversing right towards the crack from Elyssa the Rowan bolted anchors.  It will finish on bolted anchors or you can build your own.   \n\n  The second pitch is a mellow pro climb, but it is a new route so some things might still come off of it.
