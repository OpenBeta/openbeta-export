Standard fare grainy climbing on or near the arete with a baby crux around the second bolt.  After the last bolt there is a bit of a runout (30ft?) to the anchors on slightly crunchy rock.  Nothing to worry about unless you pitch off.  You will be a mess.","protection":"Getting to the first bolt you can plug something like a 2\" cam in the crack.  There are 4 bolts total on the route and a bolt anchor on top. The Bok Guide lists a one bolt anchor on top and some short rope shenanigans to gain the Stinkfoot anchor.  This is incorrect as both routes share the same 2 bolt anchor.","location":"This routes takes the right edge of the Foot formation and climbs along the arete via 4 bolts.  Anchor on top is two bolts and allows you to rap down the back side into a gulley.  To rap back to the base, you must extend these anchors or you can't pull the rope.
