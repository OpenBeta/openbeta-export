The angle then lessens to the anchors. Start on the rock sticking up below the first bolt to stay on grade. Start from the lower start to its left for a 5.10ish starting move or two. The crux is the first couple of moves.\n\n A great route to climb if you're in the area bouldering or want to explore the numerous unknown cracks on the long wall behind this rock.\n\n Climb is rated PG-13 due to the runout between the second bolt and the anchors where a fall would be large. However, the angle lessons greatly towards the top so a fall would be unlikely. A non-novice will likely find this runout trivial and on-brand for Cochise.","protection":"Two bolts to two bolt anchor without chains. Recommend bringing your own cordelete/webbing to rap from the anchor as the old rope slings currently there look pretty old and sun-bleached.","location":"Behind the boulders \"The Heart\" and \"Frictionless Sex Drive.\" Approach is a mild 15 minutes with minimal bushwhacking."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,d89ead8f-ea94-5fc1-9170-13bf8dd94398,d208a9bf-7ee5-540e-80d3-e18c87573238,f06c319d-7564-5e1f-98fe-fca4377b3069","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Cochise Stronghold","West Stronghold","Africa Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.03295,31.90089]},"bbox":[-110.03347965786274,31.900440339818136,-110.03242034213729,31.901339660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118855226","area_id":"8GwxnXVkXh+Y/vykN3swaQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.03347965786274,31.900440339818136],[-110.03242034213729,31.900440339818136],[-110.03242034213729,31.901339660181865],[-110.03347965786274,31.901339660181865],[-110.03347965786274,31.900440339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"A 40 foot rock uphill from the boulders \"The Heart\" and \"Frictionless Sex Drive\" that looks like the continent of Africa.
