From the base of fun offwidth, walk to the right and scramble to the first bolt. Alternatively, you could climb the first 20 ft of fun offwidth until you find the first bolt up and to the right of a double crack system.From there, do some easy, bolted slab moves on the face just to the right of fun offwidth. Belay from a 2 bolt anchor 10 ft right of the fun offwidth pitch 2 belay horn. From the belay, you could try fun offwidth, or continue up the bolt line to a right leaning fist crack (we thought about continuing up the crack and walking off the backside, weren't sure about the top belay). Place a couple cams, then exit the crack to the the left, clip a few bolts, and end at the chains also used for fun offwidth.Rap all the way to the ground with a 70 m rope. Pitch 2 is a fun route to bail on if you aren't feeling the second pitch of fun offwidth. ","protection":"Mostly bolts w/ some medium cams   P1 can be done all on bolts to a bolted anchor w/ no rings.
