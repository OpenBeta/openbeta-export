The climb is entirely gear protected  not a single bolt, a rarity in the Stronghold for a six-pitch climb.  It is a true gem not only because of its strictly traditional nature, but also because its rock quality is outstanding.  With updated approach directions and a detailed new topo, this climb should be much easier to find and prepare for.  For those climbing at the grade, it should not be missed! \n\n  Kerry's written description can be found here: \n\nclimbaz.com/Backcountry/pag…\n\n  For a topo of this climb, you can PM me.   \n\n  Note that two 60-meter ropes are required to descend. \n\n  This climb will take significantly longer to complete than routes of comparable difficulty with bolts.  Make sure you are climbing solidly at the grade and allow enough time for you to complete the climb and return to your car.
