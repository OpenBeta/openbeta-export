On the rest jug in the middle of the wall consider your destiny as you look up and to the right at the ramp. Traverse right and climb the ramp to the top, then breath the free air. The no fall zone is extremely manageable but does wander. This climb is new and while many of the holds have survived successive beatings, some may still break or crumble. You'd be okay on the ground up send but please, for me, don't take my word for it; check out the holds first on Tr.One day when there is more of a consensus, crankbugs will be on-sighting this rig in their tennies.","protection":"PBR Tall Boy","location":"On the north facing side of the boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,6f40f8bb-61ae-569f-a656-25752de45c0c,d89ead8f-ea94-5fc1-9170-13bf8dd94398,d208a9bf-7ee5-540e-80d3-e18c87573238,f57d396a-405a-57aa-b7db-c9320521ccb1,65ec08f2-5158-59bb-b0b3-ca7859a782e6,9e291e65-e8ad-57f3-9578-08350f773abe","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Southern Arizona","Cochise Stronghold","West Stronghold","West Stronghold Bouldering","Western Front","Heart, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.03317,31.90042]},"bbox":[-110.03369965515827,31.899970339818136,-110.03264034484175,31.90086966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116551395","area_id":"nikeZeitV/OVeAg1D3c6vg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.03369965515827,31.899970339818136],[-110.03264034484175,31.899970339818136],[-110.03264034484175,31.90086966018186],[-110.03369965515827,31.90086966018186],[-110.03369965515827,31.899970339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"Huge lichen spackled boulder balanced on the edge of a small cliff.
