Follow the face to the right at closer to 5.8 if you want a more sporty start. Needs some chain anchors added for now there is no good way to clean on this without walking off.P. 2 Goes at heady 5.9. Wonderful movement in the middle to the end. Its recommended to rap off from P.2 with 2 routes to the bottom as the anchors on P.1 Dont lend themselves to rapping off and require a walk off that is pretty dirty.","protection":"Sport","location":"After getting to the parking spot walk out for 5 to 10 minutes following the trail west.
