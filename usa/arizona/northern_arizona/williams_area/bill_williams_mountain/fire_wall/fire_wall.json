The rock is crusty and lichenous, but offers several long, visually pleasing lines. Because of the rugged mountain setting and exposure, the cliff feels wild, remote and adventurous, even though it's only 10 minutes from the car. Unfortunately, the rock quality at this wall is a little unsavory at times. The exposure and views, however, validate the climbing experience. A helmet is a good idea. Just a few routes to date, but more lines are possible."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:41.293Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:53.827Z"}
