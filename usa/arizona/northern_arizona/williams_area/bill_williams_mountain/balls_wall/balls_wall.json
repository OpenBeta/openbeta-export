It's the \"rock dike\" as described in Tim Toula's directions to The Balls in A Cheap Way To Fly. It's likely that The Balls, the two mammoth boulders located beneath the road, trundled down over time from what I have now dubbed the Balls Wall, the first small cliff encountered as you ascend the mountain. The rock climbs well, offering mostly bolted face climbing, but there are a couple worthy cracks as well. The Balls Wall is your typical unimpressive looking cliff that offers surprisingly good rock and routes. Though small, it is worth a good day of climbing for the 5.11 leader."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:43.826Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:56.461Z"}
