Continue up to the anchor. (5.6, 3 bolts)Pitch 2: Climb straight up a flake to the first bolt. After clipping the second bolt start up the headwall. This is the crux of the route as the hand holds get smaller and the feet are small but solid. Continue past the crux to good jugs at the top of the cliff.
