Intermediate. Advanced. Choose your comfort level climbing high above the water sans rope. The start is the trickiest part; either jam the crack on the left, stem across with one hand on each crack, or do some sort of combo. After about 15 feet of this, you will be at the first (beginner) ledge for jumping. From here you can mix climbing in the dihedral and on the face on the right. The climbing is easier as you go up. You can stop at a midway ledge (intermediate) or go all the way to the top (advanced).","protection":"H2O","location":"Just to the left of Evinrude Crack. As you travel up the stream from the camping/parking area, it will be on the left in a small cove, approximately half way between the shield and bear claw.

Work up the rail to reach nose feature. Get up on the nose and make the crux move to grab the jug shelf left of the roof. Mantle up the shelf and climb the easy slab trending left along the arete until you reach the top out platform. NOTE: Slight protrusion of the slab feature below crux move depending on water level. Nothing above average for the area, but if you blow the crux to the jug shelf try to push off the wall with your feet to be extra safe. That's good DWS practice anyway. I fell many times at this move and it always felt safe as the movement already has you leaning out and away from the wall. Still - be aware especially if new to DWS.","protection":"","location":"A little before Full Value on opposite side.

The warm up rock is a good stop if you need something low and safe to get accustomed to the experience of climbing, falling, then swimming, and re-entering your boat. Another tame warm-up and good introduction to the area is The Shield - a slightly overhanging 25 foot shield of rock with enticing black patina near the top. It's just tall enough to ignite the adrenaline that keeps you clinging to the rock despite the pump. Another option is to paddle or motor all the way back to the 45 Degree Wall and warm up on Bump to Conclusions. On your way out there you can formulate a strategy for sending all the classics and projects you pass by.
