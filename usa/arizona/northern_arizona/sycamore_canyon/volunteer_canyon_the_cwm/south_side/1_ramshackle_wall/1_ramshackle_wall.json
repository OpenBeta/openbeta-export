Start as for golden corner, up the first ten or so feet of offwidth then when possible climb in behind the pillar to the hand crack on the other side. It's probably best to hold off putting gear in until the hand crack to avoid rope drag. Climb the hand crack until the obvious exit from behind the pillar. If you keep going too high you'll get stuck, and you shouldn't have to take your helmet off for this bit. Once on the east side of the pillar grunt up the offwidth then follow the corner until possible to climb up right and scramble to the big tree at the top of Golden Corner.
