Begin by scrambling or rappelling to the broken ledge below the leaning block at the start of the route. \n\n  Pitch 1: (5.9+) Easy climbing ascends the leaning block and double corner cracks above. The cracks converge, then difficulty arises as the orange rock appears. A few moves of thin tips crack (originally protected with a piton) lead to a foothold stance with anchor arranged from small to medium pieces, or step left and belay from the wider crack below the roof. \n\n  Pitch 2: (5.9+). Need you ask? Step over to the corner below the roof, then undercling to the lip and crank over to the wider crack above. Easier climbing (5.8) leads to the rim. \n\n  Note: The entire climb can be done as a single pitch, but requires some clever work with runners to avoid rope drag over the roof section.","protection":"A normal rack of cams and wires, with a couple of wider cams (4-5\") for the roof.

If this grade is easy for you do it as one long pitch by extending all your alpine draws. A double rack to #3 will work and single set of stoppers. If it is at your limit or close and you want to do it as one long pitch take a triple rack with only 2 # 3s and a single set of stoppers. Or break it into two pitches and use the double rack. Â Fourth class up clean very low angle corner and move left to a thin hand crack/corner and the first short crux. A few moves lead to easy climbing on flakes and fins. This section has been checked with a crowbar and anything that moved is gone. Some are a little hollow sounding but solid and the climbing is easy enough you don't need to pull hard. Belay below the dark alcove if you are not doing the whole thing. Climb to the alcove working right around it more easily than expected. This sets you up in a sweet lower angle dihedral with good pro and another crux move just above a small horizontal ledge. A small wire or brassie is nice after the move. Then follow the crack to the lip. A wedge shaped block has been well tested with a crowbar and is solid. Above this another interesting (crux) section will keep you focused. Finally good hands and face holds get you to the lip.","protection":"Double rack to blue Camalot, single set of stoppers with some very small for one spot.","location":"Right of Beyond Nuts.

In order to avoid sections of funky rock or bushes and stay on the coolest moves it wanders a bit. Despite this it is well worth doing. Although it was done as a single pitch on gear a number of bolts were added to give you a clue where to traverse right. There are three places where you will go horizontally right protected by a bolt. A two bolt anchor was added to break it into two pitches as the rope gets pretty heavy at the top. The bolts might help reduce the rope drag if you decide to do it as one mega pitch. 1) Same start as RQW but stays right past two bolts which I hope keep people from moving right onto less than ideal blocks. Go straight up blocks into a tight corner leading cool spike of rock, the routes name sake. From the top of the spike move right and another bolt then up to the belay. It stays on you a bit here. 2) Easy moves up to a bolt where you will hand traverse right to a perfect but short hand crack. Above easier climbing leads to an almost no hands \"Honnold\" traverse right to the base of the tooth and a hidden hand crack. Much less exciting with the bolt above you it will test your balance. Once in the crack follow it to the steep corner corner to the rim.
