Stemming off the huge thing makes the climbing more reasonable. \"It's so big, it can't come out.\" \n\n  So you either climb a really clean crack by being contrived or you take your chances. \n\n  There was a lot of loose stuff we cleaned off this thing to get it in current shape.  During that cleaning a small hidden cactus was disturbed and unearthed.  After replanting it, I'm happy to say it is growing great guns and has bloomed for the first time. \n\n  This was my son's first trad lead and his first FA so it made for a great time for both of us. \n\n  Dirty ledges at the bottom and very top interrupt the clean middle section (ignoring the hanging judge.)
