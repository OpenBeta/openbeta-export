Much good gear can be arranged here, including a pretty solid #3 Camalot at the top of a flaring crack. That's it for awhile.

Scary moves lead up to a decent incut where you may be able to place tiny pro overhead. If solid, the crux, a desperate, powerful, and balancey affair, is reasonably well-protected, but if this gear fails, you're in for a long, violent ride. The crux culminates with better holds and gear. Finally, pull up onto a ledge at the base of a final stembox. This section is also cruxy and requires thinking inside the box.
