Thus a 2 pitch route at the forks. \n\n  Actually the climb to the roof and getting over the roof is good.  Turning the roof seemed tricky. \n\n  On the \"2nd\" pitch, a fist size rock was knocked off and beaned me in the head, requiring a few stiches (pre helmet days, unless you count the pumpkin sized Joe Browns.

My recollection is that the second bit is 5.8 which partially accounts for my lack of attention that day.  \n\n  You can also climb out to the right on lower angle ramps.
