I used 2X #3-6 BD Stoppers, 1X#8,9 BD Stopper. 1X TCU's and cams from BD#00-#2 with 2X BD .3's. On top, grab a rap line and tie it off of a pine 60 feet back from the edge for a solid anchor. Bring plenty of runners as the crack wanders a lot.","location":"This slice of paradise sits on the left edge of the White Wall, about 25 feet left of Forks Flyer in the middle of the red soil.
