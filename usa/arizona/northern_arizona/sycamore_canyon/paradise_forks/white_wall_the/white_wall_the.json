I used 2X #3-6 BD Stoppers, 1X#8,9 BD Stopper. 1X TCU's and cams from BD#00-#2 with 2X BD .3's. On top, grab a rap line and tie it off of a pine 60 feet back from the edge for a solid anchor. Bring plenty of runners as the crack wanders a lot.","location":"This slice of paradise sits on the left edge of the White Wall, about 25 feet left of Forks Flyer in the middle of the red soil.

Despite the choss on top the climbing here is good with hard face/seams and beautiful cracks set at eye catching angles. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":22,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:47.346Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:43.532Z"}
