The who and when of the what's been done is a mystery. What is known is that someone had the energy to walk out and add a well camo'd anchor and left their chalk in some of the jams. It seems that the route was TR solo'ed etc. since the anchor is missing a lowering option. \n\n  In its current state there is some punchy sections and funky ass flares unfortunately covered in lichen with a touch of dirt. Add in a whack block at the start and the lack of obvious gear and this route gets a little more serious near the ground. During our experience a large block was removed even though it was a great hold while on lead... \n\n  Currently only worth climbing as bonus points. Hopefully the someone or anyone will return and clean this route making it worth doing. Would likely clean up nicely.
