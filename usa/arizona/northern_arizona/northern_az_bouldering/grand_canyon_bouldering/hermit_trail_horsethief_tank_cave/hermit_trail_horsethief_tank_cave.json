Climbing is similar to priest draw pockets. Follow the Hermit trail down about 15 minutes until you follow a shallow draw with some rocks on either side. You will pass a sort of dam feature. Drop off trail past the dam and walk into the wash for another minute or two. The wash pours off over a limestone cave. This is your cave. Find a way to downclimb and enjoy bomber pockets on a horizontal roof. There are about 5 or 6 good lines here and definitely room for variation. This wall would get 5 stars just about anywhere. Please respect this area. It is one of the more secluded trails on the South Rim and has a wilderness feel. You might find fresh Mt lion kill sites in the cave from time to time. This particular cave is free of archaeological resources, but caves nearby are off limits for development. Tread lightly and enjoy some world class bouldering. Bring at least one pad and a spotter. Top outs are a bit dirty and tall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:59.173Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:16.407Z"}
