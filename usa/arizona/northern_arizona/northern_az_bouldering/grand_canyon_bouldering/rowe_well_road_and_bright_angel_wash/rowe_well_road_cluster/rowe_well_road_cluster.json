There are a few good climbs, unfortunately the longer problems and best rock is withing 100 ft of a Rock Art Panel. I did not develop these and have left them untouched. There are three lines on the far left side I did develop which were just far enough out from the art to climb on. 1 finger crack (very short but fun) about v3ish. 1 really good roof problem about v6 ish... and 1 short contrived pocket problem with a low start at about v 6ish."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:58.591Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:45.418Z"}
