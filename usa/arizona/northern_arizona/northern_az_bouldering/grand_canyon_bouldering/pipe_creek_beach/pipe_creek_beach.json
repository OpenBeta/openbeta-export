From the left begin at the fractured arÃªte and pull up onto the wall on large fractured  sloping handholds. Continue working right on sloping handholds and incuts, with deminishing footholds. A couple nice positive angular incut side pulls for the left hand facilitate a long step to the right on small, low edges and a high backhand or awkward undercling on a large, but dubious looking flake. Further right good incuts for the hands and widely spaced footholds help pass a bulge. Continue right on larger fractured holds.","protection":"Level,  hard packed landing/ spotter.","location":"From the toilet on the Bright Angel Trail at Pipe Creek Beach hike east on the Bright Angel Trail toward Phantom Ranch (up river) for approximately 300 yards to a wide flat pull out on the left side of the trail. This is 200 ft above the river, but the wide bench/ pull out makes it a safe landing.
