On the far left side of the wall there are a couple of seams. Start down and on the right one with a good right hand side pull pinch. A very nice side pull crimp for the left allows you to reach left to an awesome 1 1/2 finger pocket side pull. Fall into a clever crimp on the shield, and hit the \"spear tip\" undercling out left (this spear tip shaped hold is a very good way of identifying the line). With the spear tip and the crimp slap up right and left and then sail through some shapely jugs at the top.","protection":"A pad or two.","location":"Far left side of the wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"1Yu9GvSKUtm1xEDc4dhN2Q==","name":"Sweet & Low","yds":"V0+","grades":{"yds":"V0+","font":"4+","vscale":"V0+"},"fa":"Flagstaff Oldschool","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.58003,35.11284]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"107399876","mp_crag_id":"107399867","climb_id":"1Yu9GvSKUtm1xEDc4dhN2Q==","areaRef":"53KrnTBBXjiut4u8Rw1GYg=="},"content":{"description":"Sweet & Low traverses left on a very awesome set of holds low on the wall.

Just left of Half-life, start at huge deep pockets and launch upwards for a distant vertical pinch, that, of course, is slopey at the bottom, and pretty darn good the higher you get it.
