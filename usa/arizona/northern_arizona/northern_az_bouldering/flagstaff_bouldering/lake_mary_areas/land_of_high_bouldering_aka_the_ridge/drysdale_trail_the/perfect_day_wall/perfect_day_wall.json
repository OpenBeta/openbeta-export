It has a cool row of pockets along the right side and chunky sloped features on the left. One noticeable feature is that this wall is shorter than other walls in the Drysdale trail area; its a nice place to warm up and get a handle on your nerves before seeking out the proud lines the area has to offer.\n\n It is worth noting this area has been developed already. A nice landing has been built up giving a flat place for pads on the hillside. That also means the names I made up are certainly wrong; feel free to correct me."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:58.609Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:45.696Z"}
