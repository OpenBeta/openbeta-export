The left one is almost two finges, and maybe 5/16 on a good day.  The right one is just as skinny, but awards you two or three fingers... Choose wisely. After that, there is a perfect, positive half pad crimp right on the seam itself.  You will know what I am talking about when you see it.  Hit that, and swing up the jugs to the top. \n\n  Though most of the lines up here are Robert's or Flagstaff Oldschool, I had to rap this line, and delicately manicure the spines off of all three important crimps.
