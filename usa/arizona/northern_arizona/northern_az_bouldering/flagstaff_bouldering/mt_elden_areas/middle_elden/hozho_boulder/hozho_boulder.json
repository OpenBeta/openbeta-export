The word itself is quite special and is not to be said often or without intention. The ‘zh’ in Hozho is pronounced similar to the ‘s’ in the word treasure.\n\n Hozho climbs the striking arête/prow feature facing town on immaculate stone. Start on the lower landing with a jug rail at head height. Make a few moves up the rail and over to the arête. Climb the left arête with interspersed face holds and thin technical footwork, eventually compressing the right arête at around 2/3 height. Make a few last compression moves before grabbing a good hold on the left arête and moving briefly onto the slab to an easy albeit airy topout. ","protection":"Even though there is a tiered landing for this boulder, the way it is naturally situated doesn't easily promote a consistently safe unintentional fall. Pads will be more useful for bailing off the problem (hence the FA being a padless ascent). There are bolts on the top of the boulder that are easily accessed from the backside, requiring a shoulder length sling to equalize the anchor (rope protection for the immediate lip recommend). Though a TR is easily set up some care while climbing is required. The left arête serves as a nice directional but can easily cause damage to the rope if you’re thrashing around or not paying attention to where your rope is running.","location":"The obvious, gorgeous feature on the main face of the boulder. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,6c033448-232d-5752-8075-9bdeb17f1686,fd08501e-d91e-5bb3-8d24-93653b5ead24,7f982d42-7bc5-5021-b1c0-d944c7c9f9ac,6fc0c37d-0454-52f1-8b8c-ef25fa312a93,20edeed2-57e0-58ea-b6c5-bc61931b5a27","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","*Northern AZ Bouldering*","*Flagstaff Bouldering*","Mt.
