There's a handful of worthy problems in the circuit, and if you decide to seek out these problems it's best to assemble a posse and hike up with plenty of pads and a mission to send them all, or at least try. The hike will likely discourage multiple visits, so go with a fun crew and plan to spend most of the day up there. Warming up a little at Gloria's may be a good idea before hiking up into the Canyon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:56.375Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:50.454Z"}
