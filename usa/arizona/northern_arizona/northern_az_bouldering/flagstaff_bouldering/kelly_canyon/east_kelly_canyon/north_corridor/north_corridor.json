There is an absolutely fabulous series of holds moving right to left, and the slightly overhanging wall takes you on a tour of the geology of Kelly Canyon holds. From finger stack drop pockets to bare bald slopers this line has them all and the rock quality is excellent. Do to the complex nature of the holds this line feels like a route and may be a challenging flash for almost any climber. An added bonus is that you can stem the corridor (maybe...) to clean the holds.Start way right at a beautiful orange shield down low with large jug for the right hand. The first set of moves are probably V3ish. Continue moving up and left on the path of least resistance which is pretty well defined, and the line doesnt let you stray much. There is an obvious shake just before the conspicuous slopey rail section and after that the true send crux awaits. Top out on the large incut jug rail wayyyy up at the left end of the wall. The topout is positive, and there is an awesome little chicken head right at the end. It's sort of a perfect line if your into traverses. I spent quite a bit of time cleaning this thing and it was worth it.","protection":"The Corridor is pretty clear, though some large rocks do poke through the leafy cover.
