Left to right: \n\nThe Egg: An egg-shaped wall of white limestone with two great V4 roof problems on the left and two much harder lines climbing into the vertical seam in the center. \n\nKiller Wall: A long band of multi-colored and well-featured stone peppered with large huecos, pockets and slopers. Contains some of the best non-roof climbs at the Draw, including The Whip and the Cross and a long, difficult traverse of the low row of pockets (The Killer Inside Me), along with a bunch of good moderate warmups. \n\nWhite Wall: A vertical-to-slightly-overhanging band of pale stone, unique in that it is relatively devoid of pockets and most problems instead use edges, slopers, seams and chunky blocks to reach a break about 12 feet up. There are a few great moderate problems here along with a couple of very difficult lines. White Riot, the 5.13 trad route recently featured in Climbing, climbs out the high roof above this wall. \n\nPottery Wall: A funky, black-and-white striped cliff with a roof at the bottom climbing into a wavy wall above. There are many easier stand-start problems with very difficult low starts under the roof, but the main attraction here is Street Fighter, a cool traverse of the row of pockets running the length of the wall.
