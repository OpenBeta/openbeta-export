It is very chossy and has a lot of spider webs and trash. Nice little overhung cave with some chimney options and some other boulders ranging from straight up to slab. Features a good mix with at least one doable route on every face it seems.\n\nPark on S Highland Mesa Rd and walk down S Majestic Rd then turn left on W Legend Trail. There is a little trail at the end of the road that you can follow all the way down to the fort."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"JmRkkIxqR/OBNeFx8XLRlA==","historyId":"652ee599c4a448cde9868a19","prevHistoryId":"652ee537c4a448cde9868974","operation":"updateArea","seq":0},"createdBy":"JmRkkIxqR/OBNeFx8XLRlA==","__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-10-17T19:49:11.287Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:44:47.087Z","updatedBy":"JmRkkIxqR/OBNeFx8XLRlA=="}
