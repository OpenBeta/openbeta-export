Rock is a sharp composite with many pockets and flakes (beware, some of them will pull right off), and is about 15-20 feet high. Three sides have V0-V1 problems, and the back side can be easily scrambled down if you top out. If your sore fingertips allow, traverse the entire boulder to get a good pump.  \n\n  This boulder didn't show signs of being climbed much (see loose flakes referenced above), but judging by the quantity of broken glass, the area is undoubtedly frequented by drunk hillbillies. Good news: you'll have the climbing all to yourself, bad news: watch out for broken glass."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:49.265Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:45.952Z"}
