Bob Murray established the best lines on these rarely visited boulders long ago, using top rope protection for the taller lines. The rock is andacite or dacite, and occasionally sharp, but the lines are tall and proud, and with enough pads, could be bouldered. Top rope anchors are available. Enough problems for a day or two of bouldering."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:49.832Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:40.883Z"}
