After the midway station (clipped from another suspect undercling), climb up a suspect flake/tower, clip a bolt, and continue up and left to a chossy ledge. From the ledge, move back right, if you dare, to another set of suspect laybacks on a hollow flake. Continue the face to the top.Suggestion: Stop at the midway station (6 bolts and two chains) and call it good at 12b/c; this is an awesome route of its own with just a little hollow choss at the underclings.
