Afterwards, trend right towards the anchors on much easier climbing through the overhang along some spooky, hollow rock.Excellent movement and a nice pump marred by a section of garbage rock at the start of the overhang. Have your belayer wear a helmet and stand close to the wall while climbing through the upper section.","protection":"19 very closely spaced bolts to lower-off anchors.
