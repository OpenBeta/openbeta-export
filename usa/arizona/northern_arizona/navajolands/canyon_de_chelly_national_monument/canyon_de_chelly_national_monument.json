There are over 100 Anasazi Indian Ruins in the Canyon.  Some present day Navajo still farm, raise sheep and live in Canyon de Chelly.  Travel in Canyon De Chelly is restricted, and one must be accompanied by a Park Ranger or Navajo Guide while in the Canyon.  The exception to this is the trail to While House Ruins.  In Canyon De Chelly , there are many aweome canyon walls, spires, and beautiful formations that are a rock climber's dream.  Spyder Rock is one of North America's largest free standing pillars.  Arachnid Mesa is one of Arizona's few Grade V climbs and is 10 pitches long.  Arachnid Mesa has probably not seen a second ascent since it was first done in 1983. Spyder Rock (along with Shiprock) are both sacred rocks to the Navajo people.  It is presently illegal to climb in Canyon de Chelly and elsewhere on the Navajo Reservation. Some consider Canyon De Chelly the most beautiful canyon in America.  It is truly an amazing place of history, beauty, and mystery.  There are 5 overlooks along the canyon rim to view the Canyon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:45.343Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:41.764Z"}
