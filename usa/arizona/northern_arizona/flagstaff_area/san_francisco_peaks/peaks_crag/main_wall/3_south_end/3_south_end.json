Thankfully, only a few moves delivers you into good rock and the steeper goods. The start has actually cleaned up a bit and doesn’t feel as scrappy as it used to.\n\n The first crux comes in the dihedral, and there are two ways of doing it. The original route stays in the dihedral, possibly using a hold just around the right arête, while the path of least resistance strays well left onto Giggle Drops. Both ways of doing it are fun, but only one is the line. The dihedral eventually spills out into a welcomed shake before the next crux. A little toe tapping technical climbing and a few scruffy holds will lead you to some welcomed jugs. One last boulder problem guards the angle break. A great shake at the break let's you eye up the final thought provoking, and exposed climbing to the hanging anchors.","protection":"12 Bolts.
