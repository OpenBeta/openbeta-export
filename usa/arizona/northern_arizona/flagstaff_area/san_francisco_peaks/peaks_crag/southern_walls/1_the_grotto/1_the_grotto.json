A tough onsight, but once you know what needs to done, the climbing flows rather well and you get to juggle through some surprising holds. Much nicer with the draws hanging!! The grade is a toss between .11d and 12a.Start up cranking through steep, hard to see layback pockets passing a couple bolts along the way. After bolt number three, start moving right. If you are like most, getting established onto the steep bulge will seem cryptic at first. Well played body English, and finding a few crucial holds will let you bust way left (instead of the gnarl crack thing). Once you hit the far left arête, the rest should fall into place.

Shares first few bolts and awkward cranks of The Juggler. If this line were on the Main Wall it would be one of the better 5.10 warmups and get climbed all the time. So enjoy the pseudo solitude.\n\n Crank over the first bulge with big pulls between pretty good holds and continue up short dihedral. As things start to get steep, The Juggler breaks off right, while Hall of Mirrors moves left around the black arête. Get established on the slabby face, then do a few thin moves to the slightly juggy roof, which perhaps holds the crux of the route as the footholds fade away.","protection":"Bolts","location":"Left hand route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,1fdb38a6-6b41-5d20-993c-dcf46fcf25a3,066d9014-045a-5d86-afa4-3ffe37744b00,ec10e3d1-179b-5f62-95cb-eed769fa10e6,2dbe3673-4b4c-5d0a-adc0-7f73dbf25bd7,1657a174-d5eb-5c80-b895-9fad174ceea1","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Flagstaff Area","San Francisco Peaks","Peaks Crag","Southern Walls","1.
