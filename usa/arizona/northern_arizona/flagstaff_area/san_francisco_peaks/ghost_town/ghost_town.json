The setting in the Schultz burn area means that the views steal the show. Wild flowers abound in summer, adding to the scenic ambiance. The cliff is at an elevation of 9200 feet and faces SW, so expect lots of sun, cloudy days are ideal. During monsoons, there is no shelter from rains, but the rock dries very quickly. However, the approach is long, the lines are short and the Tuff rock makes me think that the Oak Creek Overlook had a one night stand with Sedona choss. These factors combine to make a scrappy crag that will appeal to those who appreciate beautiful settings, loath crowded crags, and perfect rock isn’t a requirement to enjoying climbing. Enjoy, or not. Whatever."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":12,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:45.339Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:57.717Z"}
