The route tackles a vertical 80' pillar, with the middle section dominated by a large and unique scoop/hueco.   \n\n  This is a mixed line, and the gear in the middle is hard to place, with the best pieces being small #4 wires. A #2 TCU can also provide some reassurance. A couple moves above this there is a good #2 Camalot pod before launching back into the scoop and the final two bolts of business. Crack system to the anchors.   \n\n  A really good line, and worth the effort.","protection":"small/medium wires, single set #1 TCU- #2 Camalot.
