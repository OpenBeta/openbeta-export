On the east side of the spire look for three bolts near a seam at mid height.  That is the crux of this line.  Start by climbing up low angled rampish rock past several gear opportunities.  Continue up the weakness until you reach the first bolt with a sigh of relief... Even if it does look old.  Continue crimping up the vertical section with a couple 5.9 moves passing the second and third bolts. A heads up run after the last bolt will lead you to a crack system.  From there, follow the path of least resistance and the occasional piece of gear.  \n\n  A true little adventure pitch to reach the perfect little summit.","protection":"Single set of TCUs through a #3.5 Camalot, medium/large wires.  Plenty of slings. \n\n  Anchor on the very top of the spire. Rap down N side of spire past the giant chock stone.","location":"East side of Kodachrome spire."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,1fdb38a6-6b41-5d20-993c-dcf46fcf25a3,6a3ebdaf-158e-5c7a-8c3a-30be2f37dff7,6c499522-467c-5e74-b44c-6ebf7e6ddc62,17e479b7-6026-52d0-ba04-de3fff8139fe","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Flagstaff Area","Mt.
