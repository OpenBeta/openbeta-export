This lower cliff band faces Northwest and can be seen from HWY 180 at Shultz Pass Rd. It's a beautiful, secluded, shady and wind protected area with a twenty-five minute approach. Conditions are best from late spring to late fall. Fall days are best for attempting the harder routes, but summer mornings are still good. The single pitch routes are vertical and technical, from 35 to 70 feet long, and all are equipped with anchors. Most routes are 5.11 or 5.12 and have a reputation for being harder than they really are, as the cruxes are bouldery, and the moves often depend on minuscule foot jibs.  \n\n  The short, compact nature of routes like Modest Mouse(12c), Immodest Monkey(13a), and Derelicte(12b) may deter some climbers who favor the height and exposure of Higher Solitude, but what they lack in length is made up for in bomber rock that gets right to the point, much like the Energizer Wall at the Pit. These hard, short routes of Lower Solitude are comparable in length to the crux sections of Main Wall routes at Higher Solitude. \n\n  There are a couple good trad climbs also. Snake Run(12a), put up around 2000, is still unrepeated. Good boulder problems such as Slackline(v3+ slab), BTBP(v7), Brick Toss(stout v4), and Hot Coffee(v5) can be found along the base of the wall and scattered within the gully below and above."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":32,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:44.706Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:29.978Z"}
