This beautiful pitch is riddled with naturally sculpted finger buckets, substantial crimps, and the occasional rest. Perhaps not a route that you would want to do every visit, but it is an enduro crimp haul and makes for a memorable onsight.Start on the same holds as Up Drafting, but quickly turn the corner to the right on the juggy diagonal rail and the first bolt to your right. Crimp your way through the \"stone ripple\" section with big feet, and then get ready to tech your way up the gorgeous scoop face which is as good as edging gets.At the break at 45' take a good shake cause the crimp fest continues above until you join the 9th bolt of Clear Air Turbulence. This link is obvious, and natural. Enjoy the bulgy, bouldery air of Clean Air Turbulence past 4 more bolts to a two bolt anchor.","protection":"13 lead bolts, two bolt anchor, fixed biners","location":"Middle of the wall, immediately right of Up Drafting."},"__v":0},{"_id":"BQVY70fPVXynkkflOHhbqw==","name":"Up Drafting","yds":"5.10b/c","grades":{"yds":"5.10b/c","french":"6b"},"fa":"Wade Forrest, JJ Schlick, Seth Dyer 2015","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.61709,35.24089]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"110293727","mp_crag_id":"110293703","climb_id":"BQVY70fPVXynkkflOHhbqw==","areaRef":"YrJxnRzeV5W/E3fZxdU8Ug=="},"content":{"description":"Up Drafting is an eye catching pitch, loaded with bomber rock, unique terrain, and technical climbing for the grade.
