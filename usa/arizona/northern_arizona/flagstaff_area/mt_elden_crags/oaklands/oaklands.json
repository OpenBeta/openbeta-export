The area is named after the abundant oak trees that grow along the south facing slope of the gully. The routes follow visually pleasing cracks, seams, dihedrals and aretes. There are some pure cracks and several sport climbs, with a few mixed routes as well. Like other dacite areas the climbing is vertical, technical, and often bouldery with generally small, heavily textured, holds. Oaklands is a warm, south facing cliff, so the cooler months of fall offer the best climbing conditions."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":34,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:43.831Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:39.715Z"}
