It's perched high on Elden, and although south-facing, is a good summer option as it's shaded in the morning and late afternoon/evening. The wall's position in a shallow ravine on the eastern flank of Elden generally shelters it from the strong winds of the spring and early summer.  \n\n  Like the One Wall, the Sawyer Wall is approached from the top of Elden; this makes for a longer drive from town, but a shorter hike than most of the mountain's other crags. It is one of the most straightforward approaches of any of the Elden crags, since the cliff sits only a couple of hundred feet off of the Mt. Elden Lookout Trail. The bulk of the hike is on this well-established trail, with a minimal amount of off-trail rambling required to descend to the wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:43.831Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:56.658Z"}
