It does explore some interesting terrain and offer some fun moves.  The weirdness comes from the first two mini pitches. P1: is basically a v2 boulder move on to the top of a cave at the base of a big impressive white wall. 2 bolts.  P2 goes up about 10' through a few crazy gas pockets and then traverses out off the ledge past 3(?) bolts to a spicy move to the base of a dihedral. Attentive belaying will keep you off the ledge. I would say this is the crux at 11a.  I may be over rating it but it would really suck to break your ankle way the hell up in that canyon.  P3 is fun stemming and face in a right facing corner.  Some small blue alien sized pieces up high get you over a bulged to a 10'(?) section of hand crack.  The Final belay offers a great view and a ledge that feels like it's way the hell up there with a beautiful old tree. You can tell not many humans have hung out there and its a nice place to drink some tea and enjoy the amazing view.  Two bolts and 60m rope return you to your pack.  Climb this thing and tell me what you think!","protection":"At the most 10 draws, some small aliens (black, blue, green?) and a few hand sized pieces. A thermos of tea/bourbon.","location":"A little tricky to find as the bolts are/were well camouflaged. Head up Middle Elden past Musical Skinheads et al to a crazy beautiful arch/cave. Go up the slabs to the left of the arch until you see a steep over hanging wall to your right.  There is a left facing corner above a rounded buldge upon which you may see bolts.  That's the third pitch.  The second pitch traverses in from the left and begins in the dark little alcove."},"__v":0},{"_id":"fKdegBzhUfmsZHD/A4mbHw==","name":"Bat Wings","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"C.
