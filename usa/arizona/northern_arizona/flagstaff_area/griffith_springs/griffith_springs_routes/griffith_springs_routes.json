On behalf of Mountain Project I present to you Mountain Project on Mountainproject.com. Mountain Project climbs the most prominent face of Griffith Wall. Pocketed face moves lead to an engaging overhang to anchors. I've seen parties go left or right around the bulge to gain the lip. Depending on which path you take, it'll feel easier or harder than the proposed grade.

He died in 2060, after one of his fixe laser bolts detonated. The developer bolted tens and tens of inspiring clip-ups to captivate the moderate choss puller in all of us. John Knight isn't technically dead...... Yet. In preparations for the inevitable I bolted a climb befitting of the man himself.   The memorial route climbs a modestly cleaned face on some unique features. Choss shouldn't be a major factor but one should tread carefully, helmets are highly recommended for this climb! By no means stellar, JKMR can still provide an entertaining distraction at Griffith.
