Generally shorter than The Overlook but with about 10 routes ranging in quality from decent to good! 2 or 3 of the climbs here would be contenders for top 5 best climbs at the Overlook. A few lines have bolted anchors but most don't. Sees very little traffic even though it's really quite easy to access. Makes a pretty decent area for pounding out a few quick and straightforward toprope solo laps with a limited amount of time."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:44.709Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:30.121Z"}
