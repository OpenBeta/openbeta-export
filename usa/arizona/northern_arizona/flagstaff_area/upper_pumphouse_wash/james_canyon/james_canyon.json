Often traveled as a canyoneering route or off-path hike, this hidden canyon offers high-quality sandstone in an incredible and serene setting.  Edges, pockets, and jugs, in multi-colored steep and sculpted sandstone bring to mind the Red River Gorge and led to the nickname \"Little Kentucky\" for this crag.     Old anchors on at least one crack show some development prior to this year, but the climbing included here was developed by John Gould, John Crawley, David Bloom, and Mat Greco during the summer of 2013.  This crag is incredibly cool and may provide the perfect escape from the heat of May and June.  Conditions are prime from May through October, except during monsoons, when the sandstone may become saturated.  Light rains will leave the climbs untouched, as the rock is quite steep.   \n\n  GPS coordinates are estimated."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:45.340Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:35.699Z"}
