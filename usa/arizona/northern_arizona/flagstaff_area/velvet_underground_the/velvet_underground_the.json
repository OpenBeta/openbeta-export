Reach up and start into the overhung crack, though a sit start is possible if you'd like an extra challenge. After pulling through the overhang, the crack continues with good hands up the corner and plenty of feet on the face, to boot. The crux is about 30' up with a short section of thin, flared hands, though good jams can still be found. Immediately after the crux, shove yourself into a short offwidth sequence for the last 10' - a rail extends upward on the right wall and can be used for feet if you don't want to fully commit to the OW.","protection":"The crack consistently dances a fine line between tipped out 2's and asking-to-be-stuck 3's (BD C4s), and something .5-1 (or nut of equal size) can be placed to protect the crux. The OW can be protected with an extended 3 placed deeeep in the crack where it's narrower. Bolted anchors with rap rings. (FA completed with one #1, two #2's, and two #3's - BD C4's) \n\n  Headlamps and tape gloves, though not absolutely essential, sure do make for a better time.","location":"Sunday Morning is located in the back left corner of the Velvet Underground cave.
