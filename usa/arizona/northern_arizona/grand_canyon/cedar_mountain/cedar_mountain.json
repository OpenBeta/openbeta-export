Volland: From Grand Canyon Village take HYW 64 east to Desert View. Take a left into Desert View, the first road you come to is Cedar Mountain Rd. Take a right here and drive through a residential area. Keep going straight. The road will turn to dirt, a water treatment lake will be passed on your right, and the switch-backs will be reached after a few hundred yards. \n\n  Many parties will park above the switch-backs and enjoy a nice walk to Cedar Mountain. If you have a high clearance vehicle, you should be able to drive down the rutted switch-backs and on to the mountain."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:45.341Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:30.521Z"}
