This is just past Wailing Wall and before Lower Flailing Wall. Arm and Hammer and Beetle of the Bulge are fun little boulder problems. I was never able to find Manly Bulge or Macho Do About Nothing, perhaps their there but they don't look very interesting. The rock looks less than great and when the rock isn't good in the Grand Canyon your better off going for a hike and enjoying the sunset than trying to play on 40 feet of choss. Choss being a very relative term in the GC. \n\n  Once again, these routes are found in Green's Falcon guide."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:45.344Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:36.079Z"}
