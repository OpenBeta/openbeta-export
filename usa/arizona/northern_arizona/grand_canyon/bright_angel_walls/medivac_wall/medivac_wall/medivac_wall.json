The information on this wall is found in Green's Falcon Guide. Godliness and Cleanliness are interesting fossil routes that are very moderate with only a couple of bolts for pro. The rock is good. I found these routes to be best used as top ropes for beginners. I top roped Loch Ness years ago and found the rock less than good and fairly uninteresting. I haven't touched it since. Perhaps another look from someone else might yield different results. There is a bolted anchor at the top of this cliff that can provide access to all three climbs. Directionals up high are advised if you can find places for pro. Not the best section of cliff for this area, but it's there."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:45.978Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:31.451Z"}
