Continue down until you reach the first big switchback (2 miles). This switchback cuts right, but you should go straight. Follow this layer horizontally passing cairns on a broken foot path. After passing a half dozen washes and buttresses, you will reach the saddle. Walk across the saddle and traverse to the right (east) until you reach the large boulders on the southeast side of the Battleship formation. Then head up the southeast slope to a chimney/crack that yields the passage to the summit."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:45.341Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:58.280Z"}
