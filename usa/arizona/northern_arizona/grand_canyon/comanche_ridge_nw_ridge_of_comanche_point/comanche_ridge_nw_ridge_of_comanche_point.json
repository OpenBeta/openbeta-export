Not just a few pitches through the Coconino to a Temple or Butte's summit, but an intimate encounter with the spectrum of strata available to you in the Canyon.  At times, sphincter strengthening. \n\n  This route climbs from the top of the Temple Butte formation (of the NW ridge), out. \n\n  First ascent, in two+ days, by John Harlin III, Anne Arrans, Roger Payne, and Nikolay Petkov (5.10).  See 2003 AAJ, pp. 201-02. \n\n  Second ascent, in 24 hrs. car to car with an enjoyable variation (Agave Variation 5.11-) through the Coc and Kaibab, by A. Frost and C. Kirk. \n\n  This route offers a preview of what new routing in the Ditch could become.\n\nComanche Ridge, from Dox Hill.  Photo by C.
