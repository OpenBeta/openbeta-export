Start from pine tree as described below. For some reason, I remember the route as three pitches, but think the safest way to do it is as described here: \n\n  P1) Traverse the limestone band, sometimes up, sometimes below (whatever's easiest!) to get out to a nice flat bivy-style ledge on right end of the north face. There used to be one bolt here and a small tree. \n\n  P2) Continue out on the limestone band, passing a last ledge with a tree, then go around the corner, tiptoeing out along the ledges to reach a wide crack that heads up. Belay. \n\n  P3) Climb the wide crack to reach a fat slot corner. Climb the corner to a ledge and belay. \n\n  P4) Climb cracks up the north face towards an obvious slot that is up and left that leads to the top. Getting into this slot is the crux of the route and is mostly just awkward. Chimney to the top and you're home. Fixed anchor on top.","protection":"Standard desert rack, nuts or tricams, plus medium to large cams.","location":"The route starts on the back left corner (northeast) of the spire and traverses along ledges on the north side at it's start. You have to scramble (or belay if you need to) up onto the limestone band where there's a prominent pine tree. Belay off the tree for the pitch one traverse. \n\n  Descent via two rappels down the north face landing roughly where you started. Seems like you need two ropes? Been a long time...maybe someone can confirm or deny..."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,451d3dd1-204c-5e56-b81a-a57f64dc868d,067c012b-dbd2-5525-8435-04aa2eebdc2f,e50e9605-1971-537c-8ae5-3b7f5284f303,fb50fce6-0645-5cdf-a9f3-f48a49280376,6b67ce22-a834-529a-99ee-88137f9bb0ad","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","Sedona","Twin Butte","East Twin Butte","Church Spires Area","Streaker Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.75678,34.82921]},"bbox":[-111.7573277927992,34.82876033981815,-111.7562322072008,34.82965966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105808360","area_id":"a2fOIqg0UpqZ7ogTf5uwrQ=="},"content":{"description":"When located at the parking lot near the Chapel of the Holy Cross, if you look to the east and a bit south, you will see a ridgeline with several prominent spires.
