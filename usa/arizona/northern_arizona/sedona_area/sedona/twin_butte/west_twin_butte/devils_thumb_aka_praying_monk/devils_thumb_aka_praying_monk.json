Short hand crack into a runout chimney with loose blocks up top. 2. Hangnail (5.10-, 190 feet) ascends a varied corner system on the northeast face. It's all about the second-pitch: a splitter 4\" offwidth through a small roof.\n\n In May 2019, members of the first ascent party Tim Taber and Scott Sellers said that they named the spire the Praying Monk. The name most people use, however, is Devil's Thumb.\n\n Alternate names include:  - Elephant Rock  - Lost Chapel Spire"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:47.349Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:00.657Z"}
