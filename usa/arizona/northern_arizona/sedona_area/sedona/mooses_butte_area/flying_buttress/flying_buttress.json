You can rap after the corner pitch, or if you feel guilty for having too much fun and want to pay your pennance, continue on to the top.  It gets sun almost all day. \n\n  Pitch 1) 5.8 60' Ugly.  Climb a junky pitch to the ledge at the base of the corner and build a belay.  The belay takes #1 and #2 Camalots real well, but if you're trying to save this size a spot for a #3.5 can be found. \n\n  Pitch 2) 5.10 100' Beautiful.  Jam or layback the corner with occasional rests.  The corner takes a good variety of gear.  The crux comes when the crack gets wide and juts out to the right.  This move protects well with a new #5 Camalot or a #0.75 a bit earlier.  After the crux set gear for your follower and traverse easily to the bolted anchor. \n\n  Pitch 3) 5.9R 150' Scary.  Slab, slab and more slab.  There are a lot of bolts on this pitch, but it seems like every time you look down you're 20' above one of them.  Micro-route finding is tricky.  The 5.9 crux is just before the second bolt, where a fall would send you flying way past your belayer.  From the last bolt, traverse into a corner and pull onto an ugly ledge with a very difficult to set up belay.   \n\n  Warning: all but 1 of the bolts on this pitch stick out from the wall a good inch and sport old homemade hangers. \n\n  Descent:    Rap 1: 150' Locate the hard-to-see bolts next to the big tree.  Rap to the Pitch 2 anchors.   Rap 2: 120' into a group of hungry agaves. ","protection":"3 each .75, 1, 2, 3 Camalot   1 each 4, 5 Camalot (new sizes!)

It is a fun route but would be better and get more traffic with good anchors.  It has been over thirty years since I did this so my memory is a little fuzzy on the specifics. For the first two pitches you are mostly climbing the face right of the corner.  The fourth pitch (maybe the third?) starts by climbing some huecos into a little bomb bay chimney that is formed by a very thin flake that you have to eventually lieback on while trying not to break it off like a saltine cracker.  I remember that pretty well because it was so \"exciting.\"","protection":"Needs some rap anchors on top of the 4th pitch and maybe some other bolts replaced. There are only a few bolts on the route. Otherwise standard Sedona rack but not lots of big stuff.","location":"This route follows the right slanting shallow corner system a couple hundred feet right of Epitaph.  It does not top out due to choss above. The route is mostly moderate and good rock but we were pretty stingy on the bolts and anchors. The anchor on top of the third pitch (maybe the second?) was a tied off baby angle and a stopper hammered into a seam.  To make matters worse it was a hanging belay!  I may have used some classic Bandito \"BAD BOLT\" aluminum hangars for some protection bolts too. Again, we were poor starving college students and it was the 80's when we did this sort of stuff.  I would support somebody replacing the old bolts and adding belay/rappel anchors.\n\n Descent: 2 ropes 2 raps. There were fixed nuts left at the top of the 4th pitch to rap off  (obviously the slings would not be good now after 30+ years) down to a single bolt (I believe it was a protection bolt on the second pitch that may be suspect now) then to the ground."},"__v":0},{"_id":"3wrjaNJRXqavRqnGQii9cQ==","name":"It's a Breeze","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Dow Davis, Tim Steffan, 1989","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.72573,34.87684]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"107916587","mp_crag_id":"105906581","climb_id":"3wrjaNJRXqavRqnGQii9cQ==","areaRef":"6Nw7X4WqX2aWTck0Xc59ng=="},"content":{"description":"A good climb up the West nose of the Flying Buttress.
