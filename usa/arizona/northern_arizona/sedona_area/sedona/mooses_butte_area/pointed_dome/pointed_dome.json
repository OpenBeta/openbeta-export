Classic climbing but very runout.  The crux is well protected, but there are potential bone-breaking falls on 5.9-ish terrain.  Bloom's book says to stick clip the first bolt, but I really can't see how this would help since getting to the first bolt is no big deal and the climbing doesn't get runout until after the crux bulge. \n\n  Pitch 1: 5.7 100' from the ledge scramble up a series of ledges towards the big chimney.  Belay at the base of the chimney. \n\n  Pitch 2: 5.8 100' Up the chimney to a 2 bolt belay. \n\n  Pitch 3: 5.11- R 150' The business.  Belay/spot from the little pinnacle on the ledge.  Climb the face to a bulge (crux).  After the crux the climb is very runout and sustained 5.9.  Unless you get gear in some funky pockets after the corner there is a 100' fall potential from the top of the pitch.  Hand-sized tricams or a #2 Camalot might work here.  No promises since I didn't have either. ","protection":"Nuts, 1 set cams to #4 Camalot.  Big tricams for pockets (hand sized).  For pitch 2 just bring nuts, a #1 and #2 Camalot, and tricams.","location":"Approach:  Same as Queen Victoria.  From the notch between Pointed Dome and Queen Vic, follow a ledge system on the south face of Pointed Dome (30' above the ground).
