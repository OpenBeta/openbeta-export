Great to do if you don't have much time. \n\n  Splitter thin hands and fingers for 100 ft.  It starts with a commiting traverse to get into the crack and it doesn't give up until you're on the top.  Very well protected most of the way, but it's tricky to protect the start.  Personally I thought the green alien under the knocker block was good for a fall, but I was glad not to test it.  Some loose rock, but it just adds to the flavor. \n\n  Rap off a slung block on the summit with 1 60m rope.","protection":"1 blue Alien, 1 green Alien (for start), 2 yellow Alien,   4-5 #0.5 Camalots, 4-5 #0.75 Camalots, 3   #1 Camalots.

At the 4-way intersection with the sign, go left on the main trail (tward Schnebley Hill road).  Look for the 100 ft. spire/cluster of rocks below Snoopy on the right.  The trail will cross a fairly large wash which passes under the spire on the right.  Follow this wash to the base of the spire, then scramble around to the north face and the obvious splitter crack."},"__v":0},{"_id":"W8ruSC+JUTCML/mwp1RpyA==","name":"Stem Cell Research","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Eric Frye","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.7536,34.8603]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108425260","mp_crag_id":"105917149","climb_id":"W8ruSC+JUTCML/mwp1RpyA==","areaRef":"aqtqsJnJWYq05HEVV00KVw=="},"content":{"description":"This route is on the south side of the spire, climbs a nice finger corner leading to a notch.
