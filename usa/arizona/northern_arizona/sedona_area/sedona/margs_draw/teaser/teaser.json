NOTE: This should be verified by a recent ascent.First pitch goes up the obvious crack/flake system on the east face that leads up to the split between the two towers. Moderate and fun climbing in the 5.9 range. Good pro.Second pitch is easier but runout. Chimney between the two towers until you commit to the north side tower.I believe I saw some later write ups of this climb thinking it was a first ascent but don't recall what name was given to the route.Edit: Bloom’s guide calls this The Worthy Adventure done in ‘96  We called it Teaser in  ‘79This is a really fun summit. Much easier than Firecat. Good jamming, etc... Pretty mild for Sedona.","protection":"Standard sandstone rack.  Hand size and maybe a couple of larger ones ? \n\n  Rap off the top towards the short side.   Don't recall the anchor, it might have been a small tree.","location":"Find Teaser spire, uphill from Firecat.  It's the squat twin tower that can be discerned in some of the photos of Margs Draw. \n\n  Climb the east face.  Rap into the notch or north side, should be fairly obvious.   Sorry, I cannot recall if a single rope works for the rap or not.  I rarely, if ever climbed in Sedona with a single line so until someone posts otherwise, best to have a second rap line.  But, my fuzzy memory says one rope works."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,451d3dd1-204c-5e56-b81a-a57f64dc868d,dbfefc9e-c61a-5cb5-8712-e12d4963df2b,c474b098-d0ce-5333-9211-27747f3a8200","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","Sedona","Marg's Draw","Teaser"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.7637,34.8661]},"bbox":[-111.76424803842069,34.86565033981814,-111.7631519615793,34.86654966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106310046","area_id":"xHSwmNDOUzOSESd0fzqCAA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.76424803842069,34.86565033981814],[-111.7631519615793,34.86565033981814],[-111.7631519615793,34.86654966018187],[-111.76424803842069,34.86654966018187],[-111.76424803842069,34.86565033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Another fun Sedona summit.
