Super dirty, bad gear, desert vegetation, amazing views! It looked too cool to not climb.   Might turn into a fun moderate with lots of cleaning and more bolts. Go for it!   Pitch 1 From a Juniper tree, go up the ramp to veg mantles through cactus to ledge. Gear belay. 5.8 R    Pitch 2 Head up the corner, past a bolt, then mantle out of the corner to the left. Continue up past a flake to a 2 bolt belay. 5.9 R   Pitch 3 Head right across the amazing run-out slab, to vegetation and a wide layback crack. Sort of money pitch, but not really. Belay on big shoulder ledge. 5.9 R   Pitch 4 Mantle jugs over bulges to the summit. Wrap a giant block to belay. 5.9+.   Drink a beer and enjoy the view. Cool ass rappel!","protection":"Standard light rack. Nuts, 1X cams from BD#.2 to BD#5, runners.","location":"Start in the middle of the south face at a juniper tree. Follow your nose.
