Continuous cracks split the south side of the tower, but some frustrating sections prevented free climbing the entire route. \n\n  Pitch 1: Start in the notch by climbing cracks between the main wall and a short sub-tower to the south (5.10). This pitch ends on a good ledge at the top of the sub-tower. \n\n  Pitch 2: Delicate face climbing on small RP-sized nuts leads off the ledge and into a more secure crack above. Stemming and finger jams lead upward to a blank plaque of rock where the crack arches right. Surmount this section with two moves of aid on fixed angles (C1). From a small ledge at the end of the arching crack the beautiful, splitter hand crack begins. Follow it upward through a few wide-hands pods to reach the belay ledge at the base of the offwidth (5.10). Belay on two bolts. \n\n  Pitch 3: Climb the looming offwidth above via aid bolts along the left side (C1). We hoped to free climb this pitch, but even with wide-crack master Karl Karlstrom along we couldn't do it. The crack is a horrible width, overhangs, and leans fiercely to the left until being capped by a wobbly chockstone, and just didn't seem to relent to any application of techniques. I'm still convinced it could be free climbed, but at a standard above that of the rest of the route.","protection":"Typical Sedona rack, including RPs, lots of hand-sized cams, and a few wider pieces.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"QcPzME94VsSfDfqkr6r8Yg==","name":"Fire Hydrant Spire","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Dave Dawson, T.

From the Marg's Draw trail head at the top of Sombart Ln hike up the Marg's Draw trail and continue straight at the intersection. Look ahead into Marg's Draw.  The Orca is an obvious spire about halfway up.  To its  right at the top of the draw is a big formation called King Crimson.  King Crimson has drainages on both sides of it.  You want the one on the right. Fire Hydrant and the Maceta are up in that small canyon (not visible). Walk cross country for five minutes or so and get into the drainage on your right.  Follow this for 45 minutes or so and exit onto the slabs below King Crimson.  Find your way into the drainage on the right and follow it up stream.  The Maceta and Fire Hydrant will soon come into view.  Continue in the wash until you are even with Fire Hydrant's huecoed south face.  Hike up to its west side where the route begins.  \n\n  It's also possible, from the main wash, to make a right into the correct drainage long before you get to the King Crimson Slabs.  It is a pretty nondescript turn and the wash sucks but it may save some time."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,451d3dd1-204c-5e56-b81a-a57f64dc868d,dbfefc9e-c61a-5cb5-8712-e12d4963df2b,1b9dbe06-a144-5d3e-a4bb-604edc1972ee","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","Sedona","Marg's Draw","Macita/ Fire Hydrant area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.7303,34.8518]},"bbox":[-111.73084794315514,34.85135033981815,-111.72975205684484,34.85224966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106935182","area_id":"G52+BqFEXT6ku2BO3Bly7g=="},"content":{"description":"Just around the corner from King Crimson are these paired spires- Macita (little Mace) named for its resemblance to the main tower of the Mace, and the squat but interesting Fire Hydrant spire 30 feet away."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:48.065Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:33.726Z"}
