Squirm up to gaping dusty flake. Surmont the leaning OW feature and tiptoe past choss pedestal to limestone ledge belay. 5.10+ 80 feet. Extensive cleaning was done on this pitch but its still a bit loose. Nothing disasterous should happen though. Leave the #4-6 cams at this belay, not needed on P2.\n\n P2 Stem choss to a nice finger flake. Clip bolt and crux on blind holds. Pull up into the corner and climb with funky gear to bolts. Bust out left on awesome holds to a rickity flake finale. 5.11+ 105 feet. Pretty fun nonlinear climbing. Optional gear between bolts higher on the pitch. Runner well against rope drag!\n\n Easy to flop upwards for a \"summit\" experience","protection":"1X 0C3, 3x 1C3, 2x .3-.5C4, 1x .75-3C4, 1-2 #4-5C4 2x #6C4, Med nuts, 5 draws 5 runners.","location":"East of Slingshot rock a 1/4 mile or so.
