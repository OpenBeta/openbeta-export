Likely permanently sandy but cool. 5.10 80 feet \n\n  Pitch 2 Hike through the Sedona VIP portal feature. 1st class 3rd class climbing. \n\n  Pitch 3 Climb hands up the clean swerving crack, as the angle steepens downshift and box up to the roof slot crux.  Closet dance to a stance, pass a nice finger crack bit and move left near the summit. Burly and fun! 5.11+ 105 feet. \n\n  There is an alternate 1st pitch on the North side of the tower that has 3 bolts and is 5.10. It goes straight to the start of the 3rd pitch and was used to get to the portal to clean the tons of loose rock off the 1st pitch.
