Be sure to sling pro long on the chimney or rope drag will get problematic.  \n\n  Pitch 1--A short approach pitch up blocky corner cracks about 25' left of the upper chimney. Traverse a good ledge atop the limestone band to the main system and belay from hand/finger gear. (5.8, 40')  \n\n  Pitch 2--An awkward crack up a flare leads to a ledge and a wrestle around a saw-grass bush to access the base of the chimney. Work up this long chimney, which varies greatly and keeps you thinking throughout. Intermittent cracks afford decent, but spaced pro. The chimney ends atop a notch, below the final summit ridge. There isn't really any good gear here, but you may want to stop if rope-drag is too bad. Unprotected slabs lead up the ridge to a corner with blocky, soft rock (save a few finger/thin hand pieces). With the full length of a 70m, you can reach a mid-size pine tree to belay from.
