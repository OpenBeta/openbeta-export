The thin opening pitch and wide second pitch have some pretty funky crack climbing, while the upper two pitches are more of an adventurous wander to the summit. Decent routefinding skills and choss tolerance won't go unused here.The name is an homage to memories at the Pocaterra Lodge in the Canadian Rockies with my late grandfather Art Staniland, who passed away while we were working on this route.See annotated photos for starting location.Pitch 1: Climb an awkward fingercrack (5.10-) and pull a hollowed roof on good edges to surmount a mini-pillar. Place a 4\" piece and face-climb low along the right-slanting crack (5.9) past one bolt. Trend up and right on scruffy ledges to a two-bolt chain anchor. (5.10-, 90 feet)Pitch 2: Move left off the belay into a wide gully (5.7), aiming for the obvious steep chimney. There is a burly move (5.9) through a bombay flare to exit this chimney. Take a couple steps right and finish with a crimpy boulder problem (5.8) in a seam with small pods for gear. Belay from the cordalette anchor around the tree. (5.9, 70 feet)P2 variation: \"Malibu Sandblast\" - This is the fingercrack to the right of the chimney. Begins in an eye-catching golden dihedral, passes a sweet angular roof, but eventually degrades to a horrendously flared tips crack. Steep climbing on thin fiddly pro. Finishes with a burly wide overhang below the anchor tree. Prepare to eat sand. (5.10+ PG-13)Pitch 3: The quest for the summit pushes onward with the Chossaneering Pitch. Scramble from the tree up past a few ledges to the next band of solid rock. Start climbing the most direct corner (5.7) but step left at the first minor ledge (~10 feet up the corner; total ~25 feet above the belay tree) and walk a short ways over to a neat little hidden tunnel. (Note: Take care not to miss the traverse left, as the initial corner becomes scary 5.9+ up higher). Squeeze through the tunnel and collect yourself atop the mini-pillar. Continue up a loose gully (5.6) to a small roof/overhang. When you pull the roof (5.7+), swing left to a good shelf with a two-bolt chain anchor. (5.7+, 90 feet)Pitch 4: Climb straight up off the belay (5.7 with hand crack on right wall) to gain a stance below a right-trending ramp. Enjoy airy climbing on the featured, low-angle arete (5.6) with occasional gear in the corner. Belay from the two-bolt chain anchor just below the summit ridge.

It takes a direct natural line, passing through the Sage Chimney and other unique features, and tops out on a nice perch below the summit. Comfortable, scenic belay ledges separate short, action-packed pitches with a mixed bag of rock quality. For mega value it can be linked into two pitches by strong parties. This is a diverse route, as parallel-walled cracks in pretty much every size (fingertips through chimney) appear throughout the journey. There's still a wee bit of loose rock (yikes) but its part of the overall Sandona adventure, isn't it? Enjoy!Pitch 1: The bottom half of this pitch is sort of an entrance fee for the route. See photos for the starting location. Meander up a shallow, mossy corner (sparse/no pro for 20 feet), aiming for an ugly flared offwidth. Stem/jam through the funkness to gain a nice handcrack that takes you up over a bulge and to a stance. Continue straight up a steep off-fingers dihedral on the arete, then work through a blocky wide section to a memorable belay seat with a two-bolt chain anchor. (5.10-, 80 feet)Pitch 2: Scale the golden splitter offwidth and pull the burly roof on its left side. Take a breather, plug some gear deep in the alcove (long slings), and rest awhile before casting off on a steep traverse up and right on big sandy edges - this part is easier than it appears, but definitely a little heads-up for both leader and follower. Good idea to rest awhile before setting off. The traverse leads into a spacious belay alcove with a two-bolt chain anchor at the entrance to the corridor. (5.10, 70 feet)Pitch 3: Move the belay to the back of the corridor. Enjoy 3D stemming between the pillar and two main walls with finger cracks too. Surmount the pillar and make an awkward entrance into the Sage Chimney. Three bolts protect a wild, airy line on the edge of the smooth, featureless chasm. The first ascent was done without any bolts. Belay from the two bolt chain anchor at the top of the chimney. (5.9+, 70 feet)Pitch 4: Lean across to the main wall and clip a bolt. Don't forget the photo op before cranking up the splitter fingercrack. Past a loose section and a gritty ledge, it opens into twin handcracks. Settle into a seated belay at a two-bolt chain anchor on the outside of the formation with a sweet view. (5.10, 50 feet)The final belay anchor was placed to provide a worthy \"summit view\". If a true peak is what you desire, the actual summit of Crown Butte is reached by 200 feet of loose class-4 scrambling. There is a slung tree (cordelette placed April 2017) that can be used to rappel back down this section.Rappel the route with a single 60m rope.
