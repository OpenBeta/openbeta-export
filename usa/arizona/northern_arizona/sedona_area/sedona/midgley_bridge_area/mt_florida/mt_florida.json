Punch up past 3 bolts to an anchor in a small dihedral. \n\n NOTE: You can leave some of the rack here for retrieval on the rap.

Belay on the best ledge of the route. 7 Bolts \n\nPitch 5 - 5.11 A0 / 5.12\n\n  Boulder up and left, then waltz up a crimpy seam. Once the holds run out, choose your destiny and either A0 over the budge or fall off. Continue up the hero jugs for several more bolts. \n\nDescent\n\n  Rap the route with 1 70m rope. From the top of pitch two rap straight down to a off-route station from which a final rap takes you to the ground.
