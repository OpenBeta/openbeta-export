When the huecos disappear move around right and step across to a finger crack. Crank $$ locks for a long ways to a ledge.\n\n Pitch 3 | 5.11 |Swim up the ramp into the steep hands flare. Press past apod and box out the even steeper bulge to a stance. Step right with exposure to a finger and hand crack and the belay on a small stance.
