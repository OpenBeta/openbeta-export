If not, then where is the Hardwick/Goforth line? Old guard, please chime in!\n\n Rack up at the notch just south of the spire and traverse 60 feet left to a gear belay the base of the route.\n\nPitch 1 (5.9+ PG-13, 100'): Shared with Southwest Cracks, this is a heady lead. Climb thin soft cracks then traverse left on mud blobs to another thin soft crack. Follow this up to and through a bulge in the limestone band. Gear belay on the limestone ledge.\n\nPitch 2 (5.7 R, 120'):Â Head left up the short offwidth, then walk into a hidden chimney. Run it out to the top of the pillar, then continue 20 feet up and left into a nice surprise belay alcove. Gear belay takes all sizes.\n\nPitch 3 (5.8, 100'): Crank out of the alcove roof and jog up easy ground to the overhanging summit block. Crimp traverse left (sudden exposure!) to a loose crack on the north face. Gear belay on summit. \"Wait, where's the anchor?!\"\n\nDescent: Gulp. Make an insecure 30-foot 5.8 downclimb off the south side of the overhanging summit block. Pretty dicey for the follower.
