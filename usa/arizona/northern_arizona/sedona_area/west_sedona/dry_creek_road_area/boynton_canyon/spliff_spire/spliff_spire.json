Go for a nature walk to the right and have a safety meeting at the two-bolt anchor.\n\nPitch 2 (5.9+, 80', 3 bolts + gear): Give your bravest leader the greens on this one. Traverse 15' right to an incipient crack. Bogart the blackened right-facing seam/pod corner, clip a bolt and pass it right into the notch. Stem up the wild gap to a bolt where you must commit to the last bit of burning spire. Throwback-Sedona face climbing leads to the summit past another bolt and optional gear in pockets if the pot paranoia starts creeping in. Two-bolt chain anchor on top.\n\nDescent: Rappel the route, making sure to rap directly over the bolt line in order to hit the P1 anchor. Alternatively, bring a second rope and simply rap straight to the ground.","protection":"Single set cams to 3\" + optional extra #1 camalot   one 60m rope (opt. second rope - see rappel beta)","location":"The route starts as a bolted slab below the spire on its south side."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,867e7293-5743-585a-8c46-9f82787eb5e8,75af4ca6-a6dd-5f5a-8bee-e51359bab81f,6ba76eb6-e962-5a5b-8151-cffbe11f6876,61b39c19-bba7-592b-a552-9d016cb77811","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","West Sedona","Dry Creek Road Area","Boynton Canyon","Spliff Spire"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.85923,34.93057]},"bbox":[-111.85977846875123,34.930120339818146,-111.85868153124876,34.93101966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117979409","area_id":"YbOcGbunWSulUp0BbLd4EQ=="},"content":{"description":"Spliff Spire is an exciting little treat stashed on the bottom shelf of Boynton Canyon.
