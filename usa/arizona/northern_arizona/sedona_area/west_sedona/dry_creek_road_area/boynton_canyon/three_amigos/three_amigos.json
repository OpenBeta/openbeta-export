Loose on the 1st pitch, but killer on 2 and 3.  Beautiful summit views!  Check out the Native American ruins at the bottom of the Rappel, but don't disturb them in any way please! \n\n  P1- Scramble up chimney and belay on ledge at right.   Awkward move up crack, belay below overhang on choss pile. belay takes .5-2\" \n\n  P2- Follow crack on overhang on right.  Optional belay at the bottom of beautiful 30-40 Ft chimney.   Belay on lower summit takes medium cams. \n\n  P3- Walk away from the belay to the step across move. Pocket up high may ease your jitters and keeps the route at 5.9.  Belay from tree.\n\n Descent- Scramble down from summit to hidden rap anchors. One 60m rope will get you to the ground. ","protection":"Standard Rack.   pro to #4, and a #6 could be useful.   No bolts.   Rap Anchors.","location":"This route is tricky to find, and the mileage might not be flawless!   Hike up Boynton Canyon for about 1.5 miles.  Turn off main trail where wash splits, follow the right wash.  Hike up wash for 10 minutes until you see a group of three spires to the right.  The 3 Amigos route is on the Northwest side following the crack system between the tallest and middle towers.   An obvious landmark is the gigantic balanced boulder spire."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,867e7293-5743-585a-8c46-9f82787eb5e8,75af4ca6-a6dd-5f5a-8bee-e51359bab81f,6ba76eb6-e962-5a5b-8151-cffbe11f6876,79c6dd7e-3ee3-5b70-b654-c85e61177bc8","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","West Sedona","Dry Creek Road Area","Boynton Canyon","Three Amigos"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.86876,34.92443]},"bbox":[-111.86930842770832,34.92398033981814,-111.86821157229167,34.924879660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112334979","area_id":"ecbdfj7jW3C2VMheYRd7yA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.86930842770832,34.92398033981814],[-111.86821157229167,34.92398033981814],[-111.86821157229167,34.924879660181865],[-111.86930842770832,34.924879660181865],[-111.86930842770832,34.92398033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Tri-peaked spire in Boynton Canyon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:43.204Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:38.962Z"}
