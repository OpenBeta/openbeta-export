Bring extra Draws as many of the pitches can be linked together. \n\n Dead-Mans trail to approach pitch can be tough to follow at times. Some Cairns remain visible, while others appear to have been knocked over. Just keep the wall on your right, and move along any paths you can see towards the throat of the canyon, you'll eventually get to a very obvious path (marked with two long lines of large rocks straddling a run-off stain) that point you uphill. Follow that till you hit the base of the wall, then make a right and keep travelling up till you hit the approach pitch. Just keep after it! If you wind up in the chimney, you've gone too far. \n\n Ground above approach pitch can be very soft and loose, be wary of your footing as you scramble a bit more to the first pitch of Conveyor Belt. Once there, step on the shelf, and have fun. ","protection":"60m rope   12 draws   #1,2,3 & 2 tips pieces for approach pitch   Prussiks","location":"Conformity Wall"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,867e7293-5743-585a-8c46-9f82787eb5e8,75af4ca6-a6dd-5f5a-8bee-e51359bab81f,6ba76eb6-e962-5a5b-8151-cffbe11f6876,c80a89c2-bc23-5887-bdf0-db13a91e4f65","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","West Sedona","Dry Creek Road Area","Boynton Canyon","Conformity Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.84194,34.92027]},"bbox":[-111.84248839990782,34.919820339818145,-111.84139160009215,34.92071966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118188078","area_id":"yAqJwrwjWIe98NsTqR5PZQ=="},"content":{"description":"Secluded crag that stays mostly sunny all day year round and is home to the longest traverse in Arizona (I think)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:43.207Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:28.811Z"}
