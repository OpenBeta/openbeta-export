Jam up to the ledge below the intimidating roof. Reach up to clip the first bolt and power through the pumpy overhang, which is adorned with finger-slots reminiscent of a hangboard. I believe there are 4 bolts protecting this section, all in very good condition.  \n\n  Dig the Boynton Canyon perch before rappelling an unknown height back down to the saddle.","protection":"Gear to BD #2, plus 4 quickdraws for the roof section.  \n\n  Two-bolt anchor located to the left of the top-out.","location":"Stumpy little spire that blends into the lower cliffs of Basketball Dome.
