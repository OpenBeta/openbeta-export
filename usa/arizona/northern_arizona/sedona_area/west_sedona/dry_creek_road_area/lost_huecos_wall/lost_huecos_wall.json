The first pitch climbs bolted slab past several bolts to a 5.9 roof crossing the limestone band. Bolted belay on top of the limestone. The second pitch climbs an awesome hand crack which pinches to tips before opening up again in the obtuse corner formed by the edge of the tower (10c). Belay on top of the tower at another comfy belay. The third pitch steps down and right to access a handcrack out on the face. Cruise up the handcrack (5.8) to the top. There is a bit of looseness on the third pitch. Once on top head east before descending slopes to the north then down a west facing gully back to your packs.","protection":"Double set from tips to hand sizes.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"6xNB66sZWHKIB1KePmfqgQ==","name":"Lost Huecos","yds":"5.10a/b","grades":{"yds":"5.10a/b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Heather Hayes, Tomas Robison, Larry Coats","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.84107,34.90922]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106126771","mp_crag_id":"106116216","climb_id":"6xNB66sZWHKIB1KePmfqgQ==","areaRef":"cIajDyGCUZ+1c8Lxp/cTAg=="},"content":{"description":"typical Sedona first pitch: loose & Dirty 5.9; Pitch 2: \"the good one\" 5.10 -clean corner with hidden huecos, Pitch 3: shorter pitch with some 5.8 OW","protection":"dbls to #4","location":"formation North of Mars Attacks (the Fin area)"},"__v":0},{"_id":"9s3ilz7RVRiuo0zi0DgRzg==","name":"The Dwelling","yds":"5.12","grades":{"yds":"5.12","french":"7b+"},"fa":"Mattson, Burchham 98","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.84107,34.90922]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"120153724","mp_crag_id":"106116216","climb_id":"9s3ilz7RVRiuo0zi0DgRzg==","areaRef":"cIajDyGCUZ+1c8Lxp/cTAg=="},"content":{"description":"Steep splitter tight hands (crux) into just overhanging fists and offwidth, which isn't easy either.  Burly.  Four stars if you are into blue collar, zero stars if you aren't. ","protection":"In BD:1 X #.752 X #11 X #22 X #33 X #42 X #51 X #62 drilled baby angles on route also.
