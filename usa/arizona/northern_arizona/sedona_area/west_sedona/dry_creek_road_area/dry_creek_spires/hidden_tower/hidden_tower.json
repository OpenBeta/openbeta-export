This can be done in two pitches, with a set of chains at about 80-90', but easily links into one pitch. Cool, varied chimney climbing with a couple trickier spots. There are cracks throughout some of the chimney, and 6 bolts, making this pretty well-protected for a chimney. The top anchors are on a blocky ledge about 10' left of the actual top of the chimney. A short pitch of blocky, ledgy mid-5th class leads to the summit (can be linked with the chimney for a full 70m lead, but rope drag can get bad).","protection":"(1X) .4-#3, 6 bolts, chain anchors, one 60m rope.
