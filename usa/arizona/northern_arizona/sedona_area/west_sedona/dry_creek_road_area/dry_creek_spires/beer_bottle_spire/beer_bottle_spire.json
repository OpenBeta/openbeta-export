Place 1 or 2 thin pieces, then face climb past 2 bolts + some optional small gear.  Continue up past a short loose section to a fabulous finger crack.  Climb this until it tips out, then up & right past a bolt (crux) to a nice stance under a roof. Out left then up a left facing corner (small & medium nuts) in the limestone band on nice face & crack moves, and step right onto the ledge.  A nice belay ledge & 2 bolts await atop the limestone band. \n\n  P2: (5.11-, 80') Up and left from the belay, passing a bolt, then up a thin crack (10+/11-) that widens to locker fingers.  Continue up the great finger crack past an overlap to easier ground, then up and right to the top. \n\n  Descent: Continue up & over the spire to a bolted rappel anchor on the opposite (north) side.  1 single rope rappel gets you to the ground, then scramble back to the start.","protection":"6 bolts. For the rack the following should sew it up quite nicely: 1 grey metolius, 1-2 purple metolius, 3 each of both blue & yellow metolius, 1-2 each .5, .75, & #1 camalots, 1 each #2 & #3 camalots.
