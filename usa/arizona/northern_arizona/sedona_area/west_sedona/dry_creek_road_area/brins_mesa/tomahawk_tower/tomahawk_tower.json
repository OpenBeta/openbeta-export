Thin to small hands to OW to hands to very cool roof move, use slings and watch your rope drag and you can cruise all the way to the summit for a good gear anchor.      First pitch is thought provoking Sedona face climbing past three bolts two old and rust one new and shiney! Build an anchor on the spacious ledge. Very cool rap off the back off of good anchors 2x60m to the ground, bummer to have to carry two ropes but unless you want to engage in Bandaloupe shenanigans to try to get to some anchors off way off the rappellers left you gotta have em.!  Speaking of lower anchors on the back side two routes are over here in the shade, one small hands to fingers and the other some sort of bolted weirdness, both to bolted anchors.  Yippee     If you're moving quick you could hammer out Tomahawk, cruise back down to the drainage and scamper up Alladins lamp.","protection":"Pro doubles from .4 up to 3 camalot, one four, perhaps 3 each .75, 1, and 2 camalot, set of nuts, some slings","location":"Route is East facing, lots of sun, follow Brins mesa trail about 30 minute and hop into very prominent drainage on the left side of the trail.  If unsure scramble up one of the hills on the right to get an eye on the tower.  Follow the main drainage all the way till you hit slick rock and follow path of least resistance up to base of route.  Look for three bolts up to a ledge than arching thin hans to ow to roof.  Sweet!
