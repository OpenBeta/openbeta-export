A chimney pod with chockstones leads to a crux overhanging, left-leaning fistcrack with decent face features and a step left at the top. Belay off of anchors on a large ledge. The rock is pretty good Schnebly, although slightly crunchy still until it sees more traffic. A good, physical crack pitch.

The anchor is 10' below the summit for rock quality; summit carefully on loose, easy terrain. This potentially could be linked with P1, but drag may be an issue.
