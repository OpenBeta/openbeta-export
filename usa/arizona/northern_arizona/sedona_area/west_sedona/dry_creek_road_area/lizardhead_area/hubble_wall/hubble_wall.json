This unique route connects a chain of broken features in its ascent of the middle of the Hubble Wall. Tons of variety packed into a relatively short route. Prior experience with Sedona funk is advised.\n\nPitch 1: (5.10, 120 feet)  Start with clean hands/fists progressing to awkward pods in a right-facing flake/corner. Continue up the corner, escaping right onto the slab at a bolt. Trend right on ledges to a steep crumbly headwall where two bolts protect tricky slab moves across a bulge (crux). Finish on a short handcrack in an ugly left-facing corner that gains the spacious ledge with a two-bolt belay station. Note: Use alpine draws on this entire pitch, or else you may have to stop and belay just after the crux, which is a tad uncomfortable. \n\nPitch 2: (5.9, 70 feet) Grunt up the short but stout cracks (OW on left, fingers on right) to a stance beside a big wobbly horn (leave it in peace!). Cut hard right on a unique horizontal to gain a short (8 ft) left-facing fingers corner. Above this, shuffle right past mud clods to the arete which leads to a short calcified handcrack below the big roof. Make a hand-traverse left on a semi-hidden feature and heave yourself past a protruding horn into the final stembox. Two-bolt belay at the top of the wall.\n\nRappel the route with one 70m rope or two 60m ropes.","protection":"Single rack to 4\" + 1-2 extra 2-3\" cams One 60m rope","location":"Middle of the Hubble Wall.
