The name is a trabalengua meaning \"The Lizard's Throat\".\n\n Start with juggy face-climbing into a slabby corner with intermittent gear placements. After a good ledge rest, lock into the splitter fingers and charge over a bulge into hands and fists. Wrestle a bush to gain the notch and hop up onto the ridiculously large chockstone. Plug some gear into the generous grooves created by one of the finest intraformational parabolic recumbent folds you'll ever see. Climb the slab/arÃªte to a two-bolt chain anchor on the north side of the summit.

To get to the base, hike up the trail almost to the top of Lizardhead, but leave the trail and scramble (3rd/4th-class) directly up to the corner when the trail starts going hard left.\n\n Traversing the ledge from the base of No Spill Blood is not recommended (see Mark's initial comment below)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,867e7293-5743-585a-8c46-9f82787eb5e8,75af4ca6-a6dd-5f5a-8bee-e51359bab81f,3a0e3340-e3b7-5dda-a2e8-fb7d22b79c61,f10db632-b51a-59b9-a852-5e73e383b179","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","West Sedona","Dry Creek Road Area","Lizardhead Area","North Lizardhead"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.81672,34.88365]},"bbox":[-111.81726815542947,34.883200339818146,-111.81617184457053,34.88409966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113811578","area_id":"8Q22MrUaWbmoUl5z44OxeQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.81726815542947,34.883200339818146],[-111.81617184457053,34.883200339818146],[-111.81617184457053,34.88409966018187],[-111.81726815542947,34.88409966018187],[-111.81726815542947,34.883200339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":"It is the prominent feature on the southernmost ridge as seen from Dry Creek rd.
