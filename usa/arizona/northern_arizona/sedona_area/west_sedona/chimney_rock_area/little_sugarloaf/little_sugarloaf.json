If you like chimneys, you will enjoy this climb. You'll find yourself twisting between the left and right walls to figure out the best way to move up. Depending on your chimney comfort level it may feel 5.7 or 5.9. Give it a go and let me know what you think. The crux is probably the first 10' off the ground after clipping the first bolt. Although the rating is moderate, this lead is probably best for a competent 5.9 leader. ","protection":"Five bolts plus a #2 cam near the top.

There is a tricky clip between bolts 3 and 4 that could lead to a ledge fall if you miss the clip. This is probably suitable for competent 5.9 leaders.
