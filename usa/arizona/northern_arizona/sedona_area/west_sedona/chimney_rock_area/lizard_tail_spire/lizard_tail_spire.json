Unlike other climbs on Lizard Tail this climb rarely see's sun. The climb starts on a fun but short face leading to big ledge. Climb through some easy 5.6 territory to get to the good stuff. The next portion is super rad, as you climb through an overhung .75 splitter. Finally, cruise up to a height dependent crux. This will either feel 5.8 or 5.10 if you can't find the hidden face hold out right. Depending on your reach clipping the chains will be the crux, fortunately there’s great gear through this last stretch. Overall this an awesome addition to Lizard Tail. ","protection":"3 bolts to chains, singles from #.1 camalot to #3. I used doubles in .5, .75, 1 camalot","location":"Located on the backside of Lizard Tail.

This might be one of the most accessible spires in Sedona. A couple of easy moves gets you a bit of exposure and a fun little summit. Look for a single bolt on the west side to protect the opening move that mantles a very fractured limestone shelf. I try not to step on the shelf at all just in case. After making the easy mantle, work your way up to the larger limestone band, then head up and right via exposed (but easy) climbing to a mushroom like summit. There are belay/rap chains on the highest point. ","protection":"1 bolt plus a light rack of cams. Some people will be fine free soloing this climb.","location":"From the Andante Trailhead, work your way up toward Chimney Rock.
