Pitch 1 gets all day shade, Pitch 2 gets all day sun. \n\n  Pitch 1) 40' 5.9 From the north-west side, go up a hand crack to a big ledge below the limestone band.  Clamber right over some loose blocks and build a belay on the south face.   --or--   Pitch 1 variation) 40' 5.10 The the good looking corner on the west face.  Probably requires big gear. \n\n  Pitch 2) 60' Go up the right-hand corner in the limestone band, then past 2 drilled angles to the summit.  Super fun.  A little looseness, but not too bad. \n\n  Descent: Single rope rap off the back.
