Scramble and hike up the gully to a flat shelf at the top. Rack up here. To reach the start of the route, cross east and a bit north on the shelf to a notch leading to the east side of the summit towers. The route is accessed off a shelf on that side. \n\n  P1) We did a pitch to get up into the initial corner. From the shelf mentioned above, lead up and right to gain an alcove below the big right-facing corner of the second pitch. There's a single bolt here and a bush. \n\n  P2) Climb the right-facing corner (you'll see some old bolt casings) to the notch above, then traverse right and continue up another right-leaning crack to the top. \n\n  Descent: Single line rappel back down the east side. Then backtrack through the notch to your packs.","protection":"Light standard rack, nuts and cams from 1/2\" to #3 Camalot size.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,19dfb197-abbe-5b60-abc0-83f875a4e73b,c6f3b827-832b-588a-9f6c-30d2c246a123,ed1da06a-e617-53d1-99be-66bd36600799,88688d90-120c-50e3-9802-c9c62716c300","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Sedona Area","Village of Oak Creek","Bell Rock / Courthouse Butte","Bell Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.76469,34.80029]},"bbox":[-111.76523760055625,34.79984033981814,-111.76414239944374,34.80073966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105808440","area_id":"iGiNkBIMUOOYAsnGJxbDAA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.76523760055625,34.79984033981814],[-111.76414239944374,34.79984033981814],[-111.76414239944374,34.80073966018187],[-111.76523760055625,34.80073966018187],[-111.76523760055625,34.79984033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Just about anyone that's been to Sedona knows the familiar shape of Bell Rock near Oak Creek Village.
