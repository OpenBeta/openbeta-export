Despite being hidden from view on the approach, this line is hard to ignore from the main saddle. It's all about the second pitch.Pitch 1 (5.8, 100 feet): The approach pitch. Traverse in from the left (small nuts protect the junky 5.7 mantel) into the short left-facing corner directly below the large tree. Crawl/scramble under the right side of the tree and ramble up dirty 4th-class ledges to another short left-facing corner below another large tree. Belay from the tree or, better yet, with gear in the main crack.Pitch 2 (5.10-, 100 feet): Soaring sky crack with hands/fists/offwidth on quality stone. The crux comes two-thirds of the way up at a short left-curving off-fists section. From the ledge above the crux, things get exciting as the crack jogs left and bifurcates into two forks. Shuffle left and pick your choice of finale: straight up is the right fork (5.9 handcrack to a series of airy mantels), while another ten feet left along the ledge brings you to the left fork (5.10- hand-fist crack).Descent: Walk 50 feet left (west) along the lip of the wall to the top of Chapulín Corner. Rappel 100 feet from the tree, then another 100 feet from a two-bolt chain anchor on the midway ledge.","protection":"BD c4 sizes: 1x .4, .5, .75 2x 1, 2, 3, 4 optional 1x 5\n\n Single set of nuts\n\n Single 60m rope","location":"From the main saddle between the North and South Castle Towers, scramble directly north up 50 feet of 4th class ledges and follow faint trail through talus/cactus to the left-facing chunky corner that marks the start of both routes."},"__v":0},{"_id":"8X4TV+ibUquZkknb+/8+BQ==","name":"Chapulín Corner","yds":"5.10-","grades":{"yds":"5.10-","french":"6a"},"fa":"Derek & Giselle Field (2018)","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.77436,34.7921]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"114222009","mp_crag_id":"114221690","climb_id":"8X4TV+ibUquZkknb+/8+BQ==","areaRef":"vqL/ym5bUuOHAjNzb0AyIA=="},"content":{"description":"This is the obvious right-facing corner as you see it on the approach trail.
