The route is high quality, thoughtful aid climbing mixed with some exciting free moves along the way. The rock quality varies from bulletproof sandstone to soft sandy and flakey. Loose rock was prevalent on the FA so make sure there is no one under the route. The first ascent took several days of effort spread across several months time. The route required several piton placements of varying quality, all pitons have been left in place. This line can most likely go clean with those placements but a small iron rack could be helpful on early repeats.","protection":"Cams: Double rack Micro to #6 (we only had one #5 and no #6 so we brought up a rack of 2x4s to place with our insufficient sized cams.)   Big Bros   Variety of Hooks   Piton rack   ALL PITONS HAVE BEEN LEFT FIXED \n\n  2x4s!!!!! \n\n  We placed one bolt and a drilled baby angle as an anchor at the end of our first day. These were the only placements of their kind on the first ascent. In retrospect, I wish we would have just left gear to bail off of and removed it later. My hope is to remove the bolt and drilled angle and clean those placements.  \n\n  All other anchors were built with gear. \n\n  The route tops out at the big tree above the chimney on a really awesome ledge.  \n\n  Descent: Do one short 40ft rappel off the big tree to a smaller tree below. From that tree hug the wall on your right side and do a long rappel towards and into the slot canyon. Once in the slot find the anchors for a final 180 ft rappel back into the Grotto.","location":"In the Grotto. the route ascends the big roof crack towards a final chimney feature. The start of the route is in the back of the cave feature on top of the loose talus/sand slope. Rappel into the slot Canyon to find bolted anchors for a final 180ft rappel."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,fa597035-a80a-55a2-9a9f-262bc7578ff9,ace36e2c-64aa-5f36-999f-0d49665ca571,83009603-77d1-5c50-9fe8-0baf3875e8b1,c4ec039f-8c9d-5e52-993b-0e7be5f3a488","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Northern Arizona","Central Mogollon Rim","West Clear Creek","Grotto (Sundance Canyon), The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.41891,34.55396]},"bbox":[-111.4194559741803,34.55351033981813,-111.41836402581968,34.55440966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110363454","area_id":"xOwDn4ydXlKZOw575fOkiA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.4194559741803,34.55351033981813],[-111.41836402581968,34.55351033981813],[-111.41836402581968,34.55440966018186],[-111.4194559741803,34.55440966018186],[-111.4194559741803,34.55351033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"The Grotto is a spectacular canyon sanctuary found just a short hike upstream from the logjam, where the trail meets the creek.
