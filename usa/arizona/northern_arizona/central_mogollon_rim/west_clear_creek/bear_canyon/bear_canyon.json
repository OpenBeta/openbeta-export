Straightforward crack climb with a bulging offwidth crux.  Approach through the slot canyon with a light rack and rope in waterproofed packs for a great outing. \n\n  P1. hike 1/4 to 1/2 mi south along 142E away from trailhead for the other Climbs in West Clear Creek. turn west and drop into Bear Canyon. when you hit the floor of Bear, turn north/downstream back towards West Clear Creek. rock hop, scramble, rappel, and swim in cold cold water through the narrows.  where the real narrows finally open up for good, you will find yourself in a hanging basin at a pool before the canyon takes one more plunge. look up to your right and you will see Bear Crack.  It has a perfect duff-covered ramp leading to its base. \n\n  P2. gasp and grunt your way up the crack and scramble off to the right.  After relaxing in the oasis by the pool, finish hiking down Bear Canyon to West Clear Creek and maybe climb another route or something.","protection":"rack of singles, maybe doubles of camalot 2s & #3s.
