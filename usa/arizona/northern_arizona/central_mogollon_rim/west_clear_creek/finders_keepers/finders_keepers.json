Mixed route, 4 bolts and 3 or 4 cams. Steep Offwidth crack but climbs like a sport route with a lot of crimps and stemming outside of crack. Fun from beginning to end. Starts on right side chimney, a nice .4 or .5 protects up high, then a #3 or #4 to protect move onto sandy ledge. Continue past 4 bolts then one or two more cams to protect finishing moves, .3 to .5 depending on where you put it. Also you may opt to start the climb using the pumpkin patch variation, a lower angle but harder to protect start angling up from the left. The route name was inspired by climber Rachel Hall, because all her friends know she's the sweetest!","protection":"4 draws, cams sizes .3, .4, .5, & 4, season with alpine draws to taste ;)","location":"On left side of the large tooth-like rock at Finders keepers area.
