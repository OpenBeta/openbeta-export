We tried to clean this up fairly well but there was only so much we could do. Enjoy. \n\n P2 (5.10) - Employ at little mixed technique to establish in the crack system off the ground. Use a combination of jams and face features to pull the roof. Once over roof, traverse slightly left to establish in crack seam and take it to a two bolt anchor. Make sure you leave a directional low when establishing in the left crack seam to the top; I bumped a cam here on the FA and created some unnecessary drag/rope pinching. \n\n Note: This is sandstone climbing.
