It was often used in amphitheaters like the Roman Coliseum. The seating gave the best view of the amphitheater. This Curule is a semi-detached spire on the right side entrance to the amphitheater/grotto. From the top, you not only have a marvelous view of the grotto, but of the canyon as well. The feature is split by cracks on the grotto side, creek side, and the top portion on the back - where it separates from the main wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:43.825Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:33.724Z"}
