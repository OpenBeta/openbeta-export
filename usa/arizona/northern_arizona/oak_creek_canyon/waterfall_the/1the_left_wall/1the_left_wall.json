The route starts up the face and arete. Turn the corner and look for a thin crack splitting the face. A good wire (#5 BD?) here and some harder moves take you to some jugs and a steep thin crack to the anchors. A very good pitch if you can figure out where to climb. Resist the temptation to stray too far right.  Bolted anchor at the true top.","protection":"Small through medium wires, TCUs","location":"Right of the Sword."},"__v":0},{"_id":"C6tGEw4mVFa4dc6y3yHWug==","name":"A White Bread World","yds":"5.11d","grades":{"yds":"5.11d","french":"7a"},"fa":"John Crawley, D.
