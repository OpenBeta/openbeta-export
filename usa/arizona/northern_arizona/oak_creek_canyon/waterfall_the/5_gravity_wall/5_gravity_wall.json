Warm-up in more than one sense. We climbed this route on a very cold day because we got to the double-clutching wall too soon before the sun had hit. It's a decent warm-up but unless it's cold Smiling Jay on the Right Wall would probably be a more enjoyable warm-up. Anchor (2 bolts but just 1 biner each...) is visible from the trail, tops out about 15' right of Terminal Mocha. Can start from flatish area near start of \"Hands\" but we started down lower to the left a ways. Either way it's junky climbing down low to about 30' of nice climbing in a left facing dihedral to a top out on fat ledges.
