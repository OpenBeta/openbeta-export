A better option might exist.From the parking area go straight north and immediately start descending down a forested ridge that trends slightly northeast. After about 4-5 mins cut east and start scrambling down a blunt sandstone ridge. After 2-3 more minutes you'll arrive at a chasm separating you from the continuation of the blunt sandstone ridge. Fix a rope and rap 100' to the notch at the bottom of this chasm. From here scramble south down the gully, perhaps doing one more 25' rappel (or downclimb) to where the gully opens up and the hillside is heavily choked with manzanita. Cut left(east again) along the base of the wall and thrash for 5 minutes until you arrive at the end of the large ledge, next to 2 very large pines, with the spire now just below you to the south. From the 2 large pines or slightly back west find a spot to rappel 100' down to the ledge. From this manzanita choked ledge do one more 120' rappel down to the ledge at the base of the route."},"__v":0},{"_id":"4/M1VIzFXZ6lyRBpa3TE2A==","name":"Heir To The Throne","yds":"5.12-","grades":{"yds":"5.12-","french":"7a+"},"fa":"Z.
