Amazing and solid rock throughout this pitch. Lunge off the dirt and layback up to a bolt. Continue up and right transferring through multiple systems (1 Bolt) to a mini finger dihedral. Pull out of the the dihedral, establishing on a stance and prepare to get creative. Esoteric moves right lead to a bolt and the crux. Funky cranking leads to the amazing patina edges on the beautiful bolted slab. More odd, but fun moves lead to a final edging move and a thank god jug at the first anchor at exactly 35 meters (Tie a knot). 3 more bolts leads to the end of the good rock and second anchor if you desire to see your journey through.","protection":"9 bolts (12 for the extension)   2X .3,.4,.5   #1   Optional #2 at the start","location":"Right side of the wall.
