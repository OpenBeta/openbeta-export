The trail is free for all, and accessed via a small parking area off the road. Throughout the trail, there is a variety of boulders and climbing routes available to climb. Some of the rocks are flaky, so exercise caution. This particular boulder is not flaky at all. The rock is firm and there are two sections in which bouldering would be quite good. This is only mapping out the left side, but upon approach, you will be able to see a right side in which some overhang boulder routes could be established. The area becomes shaded about an hour prior to sunset."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:33.109Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:44.627Z"}
