This is a great adventure for anyone that wants to scramble 4th and easy 5th class for a day. This is also not to be taken lightly. The Four Peaks are rugged, and committing. Most parties go without ropes, in order to save time, thus falling is not an option, and there are locations where falls will most likely result in death or serious injury. \n\n*** WARNING! SEE ACCESS NOTE BELOW!!! ****   The best approach is to hike around to the south via the Amethyst Mine trail and up the gully between peaks 3 and 4 (1 being Browns, and 2, 3, 4 going south). Once on top of 4, look north and plan out your attack. Head north up and over peak 3, up and over peak 2, and up and down Browns Peak back to the car.\n\n Route finding is the name of the game. Very satisfying adventure. For more information check out www. hikearizona.com","protection":"It is recommended to solo this route for time sake.  You need to be comfortable with climbing up and down Class 4 and Easy 5th without a rope.  Otherwise you will run out of daylight.  Cactus, Agave, and loose rock are everywhere.  Climb safely and enjoy.","location":"The route is what ever you feel good about.   There are as many options as one can think of, however there is always a path of least resistance, and a path with the least objective hazards."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,c1fdee82-93e7-5a55-9103-7defbe7f0b10,406190b2-4018-5ed1-8d3f-a8b80bd72717,625fc2c7-8f11-5abf-a090-78bd15c352c1","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Central Arizona","Four Peaks Wilderness","Four Peaks"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.3303,33.7132]},"bbox":[-111.33084056982376,33.71275033981814,-111.3297594301762,33.71364966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106745923","area_id":"Yl/Cx48RWr+gkHi9FcNSwQ=="},"content":{"description":"All 4 of the Four Peaks in one go."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:06.019Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:53.808Z"}
