Having served in the Marine Corps and in the Army as a medic/nurse. My day was spent thinking of not dying on a solo FA of what is now Revolutionary a 5.6, and how stupid it was to have taken that route (wearing my 30 lb pack and my. Danner. combat boots) vs a longer safer hike to the top.    While on top looking down the canyon, I thought back to my deployments, and the men and women that died. Whether you were for or against the war in Iraq, it kept the fight in the land of our attackers and not in our cities and towns.    I thought back to those who fought with my father and died to slow the spread of communism in Vietnam and Korea, that kept Japan, Germany, and Italy from taking the world and exterminating the Jews in Europe.    I am humbled and proud to have walked in their shoes. The blood spilt by those who gave their all to establish our nation, where all are free to achieve their dreams, is sacred and deserves to be remembered everyday, every minute. My hope is that all who climb here remember those that gave up their hopes and dreams so that we could live ours. Each route name that I give here has meaning and I encourage you to looking into it. \n\nLooking down the canyon after soloing Revolutionary. I was done. I almost threw up due to exertion and nerves.
