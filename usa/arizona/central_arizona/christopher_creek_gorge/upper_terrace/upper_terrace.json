There is microwave size block 30' or so up the crack. It's quite solid but use caution in moving past it. I yarded,  kicked, stomped and cussed at it and it dint budge. I'm sure with enough C4 it would go, but I'm weak and very un-intimidating;( so take it for what it's worth. Past the block there is a great ledge on the right to regroup. Climb the splitter hands to the top.    I rapped the tree to the left, but by the time you get on it there may be anchors. Just saying I'll get them up. My battery was dead:(","protection":"Doubles in BD .3-#3","location":"From Southern Comfort you would top out and head up stream via climbers trail to the wall.
