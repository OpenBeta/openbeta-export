One thing led to another and I was in Tucson before I could get the direct start redpointed. Today, I stopped by on my way back from Sedona, re-climbed it, and realized that the direct start was contrived. Anyways, almost three years later and the route gets posted.  \n\n  Reading Between the Lines is hands-down one of the most unique things I've ever climbed. It may be short, but it's straight up burly and nearly every move will have your mind twisted: kneebars, slopers, underclings, heel-toe cams, inverted handjams, fistjams, and some crimps take you through the series of flaring horizontals. Some serious trickery is required to keep the route within the proposed grade.  \n\n  For any hardman driving by, this is definitely worth the five minute approach.","protection":"Minimum (to make it safe):   1 .75 camalot   1 #1 camalot   1 #2 camalot   1 #3 camalot   1 #4 camalot \n\n  For an onsight attempt I would recommend doubles of #1, #2, and #3s, and maybe a #5.    Extend your pieces or suffer at the top. Tape is a good idea. Rap from chains (which can easily be reached from above for a TR).","location":"RBtL uses the rightmost bolt on the wall (to date). Start about 10 feet right of the bolt. Climb up some easy ledges until you reach the first horizontal, plug in some gear and work up to, and past, the bolt. Traverse to the right end of the last visible horizontal from the ground (about 5 feet above the bolt), bust some wild moves and try to not fall off while clipping the chains."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,c1fdee82-93e7-5a55-9103-7defbe7f0b10,d6ab76d5-3866-5e4a-bc91-e2b35e7c6a5e,ba21a0c8-eb40-517d-af21-97fe3a7697c7","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Central Arizona","East Verde","Blooming Wall, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.356,34.2978]},"bbox":[-111.35654430375614,34.29735033981814,-111.35545569624388,34.29824966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107119992","area_id":"uiGgyOtAUX2vIZf+OnaXxw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-111.35654430375614,34.29735033981814],[-111.35545569624388,34.29735033981814],[-111.35545569624388,34.29824966018187],[-111.35654430375614,34.29824966018187],[-111.35654430375614,34.29735033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"East facing.
