Most of the routes face south like Time Zone. The other side of the formation is the north facing Giant Steps wall. Routes are on and around the obvious, free standing leaning pillar sitting on a high ledge. Look right behind an oak tree for an interesting face split by a crack that has a roof on its right side. Out right of this is another pillar with some lines in its overhanging north face. Other routes are on a wall down and left of the pillar."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:36.523Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:21.666Z"}
