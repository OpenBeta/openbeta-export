The south and east sections face the boat ramp area. The vertical to overhanging south and north walls sport a variety of tall face and crack problems, the east end has a few good roof problems, and the west end features a number of freestanding boulders. Short approach and generally good rock quality. You might want pads and spotters for some of the taller problems."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:36.524Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:21.265Z"}
