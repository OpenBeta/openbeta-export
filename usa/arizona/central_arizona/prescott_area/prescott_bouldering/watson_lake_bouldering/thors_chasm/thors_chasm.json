It took a full day to clear the chasm of dead bushes, huge rotten logs, and an impressive amount of throat choking tumble weed.\n\n The result, however, was well worth the effort. After rapping and scrubbing the lines, I knew I was onto some of the best highball bouldering around Prescott. I did most the FAs by myself with a single midget pad, but it wasn't long before I had friends there sampling the goods. All the lines were quickly repeated by Danny Schwarz and Mike Gasch. Mike was also able to send the only true project on the wall, which we thought was V8 or V9, but this was a while back. With this line, Wide Open Gasch, a new difficulty came to Watson Lake, which is really known for its tall, scenic moderate problems.\n\n The problems listed here start down in the chasm, with Crystal Witches being the left most line. Though these lines push the 25'-30' mark, the way the wall is set up, one can jump back to the far side of the chasm at about 15' which is kind of rad. All the lines top out on a traverse ledge, with a convenient down climb on the climber's right by a tree. Some of these lines pass bolts, but if your into this kind of climbing that shouldn't bother you none."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.598Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:46.799Z"}
