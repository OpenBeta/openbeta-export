This beginner/kids wall is a good alternative to Time Zone if you're looking for something not as tall, steep or busy. No bolts on top, bring gear and long slings for TR set up. There's a number of moderate VO- to VO+ problems off a ledge out right where the slab gets shorter. Dread Wall is a little farther out right. It's the vertical, bullet hard 12' face with a crack in the middle. VO+ to V3/4 probs with good landings. It's kind of below the Thor's Marbles area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:36.525Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:21.715Z"}
