Rock quality is generally good, but crumbly spots can be found. The problems and holds here are unique. There are some great of crack problems here, as well as some difficult, steep face problems. Landing zones are pretty good for the most part, but some are pretty dicey. This place has lots of great rock and a lot of potential. This spot is a bit warmer than Prescott, and you're unlikely to run into anybody.
