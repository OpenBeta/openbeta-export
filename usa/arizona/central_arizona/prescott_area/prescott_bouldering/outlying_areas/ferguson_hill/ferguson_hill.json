Rock is similar to the in-town granite up in Prescott. There’s a lot of it, and overall it’s pretty good. Many of the boulders are tall. By the looks of things, I doubt the area has seen much route development other than the small amount I've done. Be prepared for some brush and catclaw fighting. Excellent central AZ adventure bouldering. This is AZ State Land so access is good."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.588Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:24.541Z"}
