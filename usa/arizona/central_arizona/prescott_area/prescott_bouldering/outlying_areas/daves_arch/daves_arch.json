There are a hand full of steep problems on the north side and a few others on the other.  The rock is sharp and the holds (finding them) can be quite confusing compared to other local areas.  This is adventure bouldering at its finest, and there are several steep classics to discover. It is the unique nature and placement of this arch which make it a worthwhile jaunt if the motivation and opportunity arise."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.589Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:46.711Z"}
