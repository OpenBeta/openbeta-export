Love avoiding broken glass and cacti? Is petting sharp granite a picture of your ideal way to spend an afternoon? If you answered yes to any of these, then come on down to the Bloody Basin Boulders. Or don't. Seriously, I don't recommend it. Watch out for hunters, atv riders, wild animals, spine laden desert flora, and UV rays. The only plus side to this tiny rock pile is that it is up at almost 4k feet of elevation, and a bit cooler than the Phoenix temps.TLDR: Don't make the mistake I did and turn off the highway thinking you can find some gem of a boulder.
