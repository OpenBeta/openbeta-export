This area is entirely on private property. The manager and residents of the apartment complex are fully aware of it's use by non residents. So far this hasn't been a problem. Also the private homeowners are also aware, some of the climbs are right to the houses so please be respectful. Recently I've also noticed some damage to trees, and trash being left behind - I hope it is not us."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.586Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:31.043Z"}
