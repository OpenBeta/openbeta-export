There are about 45 or so face and crack routes here on good ol' In-Town granite. Problems tend to be highball. It has a south side facing Westridge Rd., an east end facing the trailhead and RV storage lot, and a north side that faces some private homes. (This area was formally known as the Westridge Boulders. I figured that if someone is going to go through the trouble of bolting a name to them, we might as well use that name!)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.594Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:31.528Z"}
