These boulders sit up on some slabs just east of a north/south running gully. Look for the obvious round boulder split by a hand crack. See photo of climber in the crack shown on In-Town Bouldering main page. Map pin is pretty accurate. Nearby homeowners living on the other side of the gully don't seem to mind climbing activity, but you still want to keep a low profile. There's often homeless camps back here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.593Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:24.810Z"}
