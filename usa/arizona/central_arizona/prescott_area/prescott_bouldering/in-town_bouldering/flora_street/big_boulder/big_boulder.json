Lots of features on its overhanging south side.Two problems are known, although there's potential for a few others. Kind of tall with mixed landings, some have been levelled. Pads or TR. Other easier problems on a nearby dark boulder and slabs to the right. Lots of problems on the jumble of boulders on the hill behind too. Many have overhanging aspects. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.598Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:46.780Z"}
