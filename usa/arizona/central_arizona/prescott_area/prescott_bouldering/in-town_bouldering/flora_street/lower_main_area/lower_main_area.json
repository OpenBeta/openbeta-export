The line starts low and left with a good jug-shelf and excellent right foot. From there work up the nobs, matches, and crimps to a big reach for a high, right crimp. The hold is good but definitely the crux of the problem! From there cross-over and it’s smooth sailing to the top.Probably been climbed before, if anyone has info do tell but for now...FA: Cole Ortagus & Keenan Hammack","protection":"1-3 pads, ankle roller rocks below first few moves","location":"From the animal hospital parking lot follow a series of washes and hobo trails uphill about 300 yards.
