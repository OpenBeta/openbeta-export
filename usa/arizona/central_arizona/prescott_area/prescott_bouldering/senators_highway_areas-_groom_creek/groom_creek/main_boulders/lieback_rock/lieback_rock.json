In no time flat the  flames were lit, and he fired it off in a handful of tries. I was never able to do it, so it could be harder than V8. I think I was too tall;) \n\n  Eric's been climbing for forty years or more, whith much of that time traveling and sampling the goods all over the country. Classic, hard problems tend to bob around in his wake, and I think this line is another to add to the list.
