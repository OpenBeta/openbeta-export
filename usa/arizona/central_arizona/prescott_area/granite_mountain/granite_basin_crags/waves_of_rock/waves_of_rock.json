Continue past the tree following discontinuous cracks to the juniper belay above.  -via the Bill Cramer guidebook \n\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pitch one is really where the money is on this climb. Absolutely worth it for that pitch. Chimneying out of the cave to surmount the boulder that leads to the dihedral was a ton of fun, and easy enough to protect. There is an opening in the chimney that looks directly at the beginning of the dihedral, aim for that. Outside of the cave seems to be another option to gain the boulder, but it was quite overgrown so we opted to go inside. Once on top of the boulder there is a thin bouldery move to gain the dihedral, which was slightly committing, maybe a little bit tricky pro there, but i was able to get my smallest totem in the thin crack right before the move. After you've gained the dihedral it's some very fun finger and hand crack traversing to the belay.\n\n Pitch two was very easy, following discontinuous cracks. I ran this pitch out to avoid rope drag. \n\n Overall a really enjoyable climb in a great area with lots of other fun stuff nearby!Â ","protection":"small to OW.

This climb is a perfect introduction to multi-pitch climbing for novices, but the spectacular views of Granite Basin and Granite Mountain make the outing worthwhile for climbers of any skill level. There are four sets of anchors (bolt hangers only), allowing the climb to be broken into four pitches. However, the climb can be done in two pitches with a 60 meter rope.        Pitch 1: The steepest climbing and hardest moves occur in the first 60 feet. Clip bolts up a steepening face and over two large horizontal cracks, passing a set of optional belay anchors midway. There are several options for placing cammiing devices or stoppers on the lower part of the pitch. Belay at a second set of anchors.        Pitch 2: Clip bolts up more mellow terrain than the previous pitch. Clip an old fixed pin and two more bolts then angle up and left to find the belay/rappel anchors at a shelf.          Descent: If looking down the face, rappel into  the gully on the right on two 60 meter ropes, or walk off on the slabs to the left. For the rappel, descend past the very large ponderosa pine, being careful not to dislodge loose rocks at its base. 50 feet below the tree, down-climb easy terrain to finish the descent. A second rappel can be set up on the tree if desired, avoiding the down-climbing. 10-12 feet of webbing and a rap-ring may come in handy.","protection":"Pitch 1: 11 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor.
