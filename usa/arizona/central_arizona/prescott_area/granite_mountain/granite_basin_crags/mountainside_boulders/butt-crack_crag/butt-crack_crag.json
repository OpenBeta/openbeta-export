To do it in one its best to scramble to the ledge above the slab, to prevent rope drag. Or start at the base of the run out slab, climb to ledge just right of little tree at the base of the right facing crack. Set up anchor and climb. The main crack runs up the middle right above the tree on the ledge, crack starts kind of thin. The block when puling the bulge is kinda shaky, but we used it. Once you are on lower angled rock, the crack continues, progressively widening until a good sized tree protrudes out of crack. (tree can be used to top rope as well).","protection":"cams .3-4, larger size nuts.","location":"There is a walk off on climbers right.
