Routes begin in the shadows and move upward. This is generally a complex area to figure out at first. The climbing is really fun traditional climbing. Rap anchors are available at the top. a single 60 meter rope will get you down. The large green crack high above the formation is a good feature to locate the area. Broken Arrow is a tremendous hand crack deep in the canyon with several exit options."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:37.355Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:33.060Z"}
