Quirky climbing that probably isn't for everyone. \n\n  The routes start in the \"crevasse\" between the shorter and taller sections of the dome.  You must boulder down 10 ft. into the crevasse to start and belay.  There is a tiny ledge to belay from but you need to build a gear anchor to protect the belayer.  If the leader falls or hangs, an unanchored belayer will be dragged into the gap and fall toward the water below.  Quite dangerous. \n\n  The rock is looser than other West Shore walls (or just hasn't been climbed as much).  Grit and gravel rain down on the belayer.   \n\n  It is possible to walk-off by downclimbing the low point toward shore but you can also rappel/lower from fixed anchors.  Careful rope management is required to keep your rope out of the filthy water."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:35.580Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:20.940Z"}
