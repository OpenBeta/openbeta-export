The majority of the routes are bolted and range from 5.5 to 5.11 currently. The rock is coarse and getting better with time. Many of the routes have seen few ascents so bear in mind that we are still in the break in phase. It is imperative that climbers are mindful of hikers and keep the trail free of gear and pets. This area has been in the back of our mind for years while we worked on taller routes in the vicinity. Eventually we all came around to the idea of a quick hit sport climbing area that was easy to access and quick to climb.
