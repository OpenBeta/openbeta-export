Traverse to the right of a diagonal bulge then surmount a large horizontal flake about 3/4 of the way up the wall. Above it, find a 2-bolt belay station. Second pitch is about 25 feet of easy climbing to a 2-bolt anchor. Can comfortably be done as one pitch with a 70m rope. 60m might work, but make sure the free end of the rope is secured. Descent: top anchor bolts may be too small to accommodate safety tether while rigging for rappel, so be careful. Also: the ledge at the first belay makes rope-pulling tricky. Either rap in two pitches; or walk all the way off to the north and scramble down to the ground; or walk north along the broad summit to one of the nearby rap stations for Granite Alley or Alpenglow (may need 70m rope for these). ","protection":"6 bolts on the first pitch, 2 on the second.
