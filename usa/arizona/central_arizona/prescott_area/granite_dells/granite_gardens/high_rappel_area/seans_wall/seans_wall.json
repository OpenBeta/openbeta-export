The climbs on the left are high quality easy slab climbing and the routes on the right are very good quality steep mixed climbing. It is difficult to set the upper routes up on TR and requires lots of scrambling both up and down to get to the chains. The routes on the lower level require very exposed traversing to get to the anchors. I suggest leading routes. This is a great place to bring a group of mixed abilities.
