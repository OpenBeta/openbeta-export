The wall faces west and at its highest is roughly 30 meters.  A few sport routes exist with a few more trad and mixed routes.   The rock typically can take great gear on many routes (as tested).     The rock is a perlite flow apart of the Picket  Post Volcanic series.  Somewhat similar to a basalt flow in how it climbs.  Some routes still have loose rock and climbers, belayers, and dogs should be careful!    The first crack that was climbed here found a Chuckwalla was found 20 meters up jammed inside the crack. This is \"slack\" country AZ climbing, you may find bats, scorpions, etc. Deal with it.   The wall faces west and with the dark rock, it can get pretty hot.  Be respectful to the OHV, horseback riders, hunters, and other using Wood Canyon.  It generally is a secluded and quiet place.  Not much shade once the sun goes up until it goes behind the hills. 60 meter rope is OK, watch your ends.  Many routes have rappel anchors with quick links or steel lockers.  You may want to bring some quick links along on your lead.  The steel lockers are not booty; please leave them.  Top roping can be difficult on some of the climbs as you may have to extend the anchors.  Most anchors are over the edge of the cliff and not easily reached from above (you can easily build an anchor w/ gear above to setup a TR).  More potential exists for easy (<5.6) trad climbs on the south side of the wall for those willing to do the cleaning.  The ethic here is to not bolt mostly protect-able lines.     The cracks and pockets take nuts and cams well.  A single set of nuts, hexes, along with a single set of cams (maybe doubles of certain sizes, cams up to #4 c4) will be useful.     You could camp here, it's all USFS Tonto NF land.  No bee hives in the rocks, just friendly bees around.  Dog friendly if it isn't too hot. Follow the cairns to the crag."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":14,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:02.880Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:58.948Z"}
