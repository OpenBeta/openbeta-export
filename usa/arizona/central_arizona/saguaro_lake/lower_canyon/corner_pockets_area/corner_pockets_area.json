It is about 30 feet long and 40 feet tall. The rock looks a little spooky and loose but the holds and jugs are generally bomber. While the main route described here climbs the corner up steep, slightly overhanging terrain the culminates in a very steep roof up high. It's a great wall to work out on and definitely a scenic and fun place to be. You'll be catching the attention of passing boaters so please comport yourself with as much dignity as you can muster so they don't try to ban climbing here. A whole series of variations have been done on this wall and you can choose your own adventure. The route described here is the one that's been intentionally cleaned."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:04.181Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:28:21.781Z"}
