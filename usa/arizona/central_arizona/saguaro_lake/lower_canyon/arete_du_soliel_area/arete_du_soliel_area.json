From land, get over to the base of the rock. There is a \"trail\" from the logical boat landing to the base of the cliff. From there make your way up 4th class ramp with some loose rock to the base of the arete and get on. There are two cruxy sections and the climbing is good and sustained at the grade from the first bolt onward. At this moment, the route is missing the final bolt but a .75 or #1 cam will protect the final moves. NOTE: This project hasn't seen a free ascent on lead yet, just toprope.
