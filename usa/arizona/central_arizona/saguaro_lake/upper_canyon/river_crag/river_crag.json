It's almost always quiet and peaceful, the rock is good and its a wide, low slung crag with a high concentration of routes in a relatively small area. Nice combination of crack climbs, face climbs, roofs, traverses and aretes. Since there's often a current here, it's recommended not to anchor your craft somewhere nearby and swim-in, instead just keep someone aboard to man the boat and keep a lookout while the others climb. \n\n This is a really cool area and Cottonwood Creek Beach is just a 1/3 mile away when you want to take a break and land somewhere. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:03.486Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:59.751Z"}
