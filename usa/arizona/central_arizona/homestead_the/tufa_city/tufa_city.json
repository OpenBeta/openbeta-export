What a blast this turned out to be. Start on a popcorn covered slab and angle left to a short section of slightly overhanging tufa climbing that has great holds, movement and flow. The steep face takes you to a corner system that looks like you could do with no hands. Despite easing considerably we didn't feel like we were slogging higher just to make the climb longer. The easiest climb at Tufa City and a great warm up for Couples... Tufa Yard Dash or any of the elevens. My guess is that by next year this will have as much chalk on it as any of the classics. To be fair about the grade, we did this over the two days we were there. We climbed at Rough Rider all morning then as this side of the canyon got shade we hiked over to stay in the shade and climbed more. Then we set this up with the last two hours of light. We both found ourselves pretty pumped at the end of the steep crux section (could be we were tired from all the other routes we had done) but we had already climbed all day so we thought it is probably 5.10 but it could be a tad harder. If you don't enjoy the movement and holds on this I will be surprised.","protection":"12  Bolts and Anchors","location":"Walk past the boulders at the base of Dead Sea, Tufa Tussle and Micro Burst.
