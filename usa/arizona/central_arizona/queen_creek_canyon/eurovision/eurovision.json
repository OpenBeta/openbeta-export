After 15 feet of 4th class slab to a ledge, stem up the dihedral to clip the first bolt. Though the dihedral is climbable, we chose to climb in from the right with an engaging, somewhat slopey traverse until you’re over the first bolt. The bolting is very friendly and at least one bolt can be bypassed by clipping a little high. Do some compression-type moves between small crimps on the face and slopers on the arete. There are no real rests, but there are a couple of incut holds to shake a hand on. The route goes quick! All of the holds are super solid and the movement is quite unique. Probably 11d/12a.","protection":"Bolts to chain anchors!","location":"Follow the directions under Eurovision sub-area.
