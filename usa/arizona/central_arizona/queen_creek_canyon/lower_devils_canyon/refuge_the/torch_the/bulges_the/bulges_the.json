Route follows the vertical crack the right side of the face.  Good rock and great gear opportunities make this a good option for a beginning trad lead for the area.  Two options to finish, described below. \n\n  As the angle of the rock lessens: \n\n  1. Continue to follow the crack as it trends slightly left to the belay/rap anchor for 3 RNs. \n\n  2. Step right onto low angled, featured rock, heading toward a bulge.  Pull the bulge and continue to the top.  A short/easy down-climb will put you at the belay/rap anchor, which is located on the rock face just behind the rout.  The bulge protects well, keeps the route at 5.6, and, in my opinion, is the better finish.  Rap down the gully behind the route.
