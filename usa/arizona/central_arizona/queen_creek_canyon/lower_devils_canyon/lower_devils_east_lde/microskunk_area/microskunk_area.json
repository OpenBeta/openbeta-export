It is one of the original routes in LDE; we have tried to determine who established this route but have to this point been unable to. \n\n  Pitch 1 (100', 5.9):  Start at the northeast corner of the tower.  Scramble up broken rock to the beginning of a crack system headed up the right side of east face of the tower.  Getting established in the crack system requires some tricky gear and committing moves.  Follow the crack system until it is possible to move right to a two bolt anchor on the north face of the tower. \n\n  Pitch 2 (80', 5.11-):  Not reccommended due to a lot of friable rock and some shaky pro.  Move up and right from the anchor to a bolt.  Clip the bolt and ascend the thin crack approx 50'.  Clip a second bolt at the end of the crack and move up toward a three-bolt anchor. \n\n  While the first pitch is actually a lot of fun, the second pitch suffers from poor rock and less-than-perfect gear.  Both anchors are now equipped with quicklinks and carabiners to make descent easier.","protection":"Stoppers, doubles through #3 camalot.

Start by climbing a thin crack on the right side of the face.  The crack leads to series of bolts arching to the left.  The short section of poor rock gives way to a great 2\" crack in the middle of the face.  Ascend the crack until it narrows and a bolt appears on your left.
