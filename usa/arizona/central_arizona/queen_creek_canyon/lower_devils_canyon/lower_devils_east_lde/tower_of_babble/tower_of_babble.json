(See the Climbology Area.)  To reach this tower, first climb Advanced Geir, then rappel the south face.  You will note the anchors are NOT near the edge of the tower, this is to facilitate a tyrolean traverse to get back.  See below for details. \n\n  At this time one route ascends the Northeast side of the tower (5.10 PG13).  We are looking for a better line up the tower as the rock quality is poor. \n\n  As this tower practically begs to be different, there is only one way to return once you have summitted the tower, and that is by tyrolean traverse.  Careful planning and previous training/experience setting up tyroleans are necessary; anchors at the top of both towers have been placed allow the return trip. \n\n  If you cannot climb the route up the tower or change your mind about the tyrolean, you can always ascend the rap line or attempt the heinous bushwack out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:04.878Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:57:03.243Z"}
