The two towers are connected by a natural bridge formed by several blocks.  Touching the Coop is on the northeast arete of the second tower.  It's necky 5.10 but the thrill is worth it. \n\n  While the natural bridge is well away from the route, we still respect its mass!  Therefore, we broke with tradition and installed a \"clip and lower\" anchor at the top of this route rather than making the leader top out.  Please check the carabiners at the top before lowering.  Note that the carabiners are part of the anchor, please do not remove them or your ropes (and everyone else's) will be badly twisted when pulled. \n\n  Start by scrambling up to the left side of the arete, placing gear in a crack.  Clip a bolt, move onto the arete, and climb up a few moves (5.10).  The gear is good but tricky and a bit spaced out in places.  Some committing moves and a second crux lie just before the second bolt.   \n\n  This climb is for a solid leader at its grade.","protection":"Standard rack to #4 camalot.
