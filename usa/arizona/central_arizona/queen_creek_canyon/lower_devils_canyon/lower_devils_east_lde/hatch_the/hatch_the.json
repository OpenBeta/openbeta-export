The first pitch is typical moderate queen creek face climbing protected with occasional horizontals and discontinuous crack systems.  The stellar second pitch, however, is a different story: it is a wavy crack system that ends with a committing, technically challenging bulge.  Those with a cool head and solid trad skills will find good gear protecting this exciting crux.  It is a memorable LDE lead. \n\n  1) On the NW corner of the formation, climb the right-most crack to a small ledge.  Continue up and to the right of thin, discontinuous cracks.  Finish up the pitch on a large ledge at a two bolt anchor (5.8, 90').   \n\n  2) Step right to a crack running up the middle of the north face.  The crack protects nicely using a wide range of cams.  The crack ends below a 5.10 bulge.  Pull the bulge protected by tricky but solid gear.  (5.10a/b, 70').  \n\n  From here either rappel the route or traverse south to finish on the final pitch of The Shmotem Pole.","protection":"Stoppers, Doubles through #3 camalot.
