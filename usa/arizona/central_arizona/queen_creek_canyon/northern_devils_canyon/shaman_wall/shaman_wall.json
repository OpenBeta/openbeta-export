It can get pretty windy, but usually offers some shelter from gusty days and heat.  The rock is less grating than the typical NDC dacite, so you can get more pumped than raw from a day of climbing. \n\n  The routes were bolted, for the most part, ground-up.  This was not done in an attempt to thump on my chest or to prove anything to anyone.  I bolt routes as it pleases me, for my own climbing enjoyment.  If you are going to criticize my efforts, at least have the courtesy to do so after visiting the crag and climbing the lines.  IMHO, the climbing community doesn't need any more safety monitors to dumb it down and defeat natural selection."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:04.877Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:52.463Z"}
