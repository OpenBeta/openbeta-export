Starts in a chimney (it's easier then it 1st appears) and one side-clips the 1st bolt leaning out from the right. The climbing then goes directly above 1 (it's not necessary to go out right). The crux follows off 2 and features an extremely challenging clip to 3 (might have been at one time much easier and for this reason we took off a star); this section is the lowest angle part of the climb but is very bouldery. The upper part of the climb is amusing large holds which somewhat helps if you are tall. The last bolt intelligently directs the rope from not abrading against the face below.
