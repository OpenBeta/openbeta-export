Be careful of the bolt on the very top and avoid it if possible. You'll know why when you see it.  The top belay anchors are down from the top of the buttress near the hole created by three boulders in between the main formation and the NE buttress. You may want to set up short rap or tagline to get to the anchors, depends on how comfortable you feel descending the 7 ft or so into the pocket.
