The rock is for the most part solid granite, but be careful of loose gravel over the surface on ledges.

It's a pick-your-own-adventure style route, so go up whatever looks good and aim for a large ledge about 80' up. At this point, start traversing right. Somewhere in here is the first of several old bolts on the route. There are just enough to let you know you're on route. Keep traversing right, gaining no elevation. When you come to a bolt with ring and second nearby bolt, traverse down and right (do not be lured into going up) around a corner. At this point you should see cairns built on a boulder in a small amphitheater type formation. Keep following the easiest line up and right into August Canyon. \n\n  Overall a super fun scramble on (mostly) good rock.","protection":"None.
