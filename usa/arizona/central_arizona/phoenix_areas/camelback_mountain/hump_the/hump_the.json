The rock is solid granite, and is far better quality than most of the climbing at Camelback. The climbing is very fun, with bolts at the cruxes. Larger holds at the beginning give way to vertical climbing on crimps. Stays in the shade during warm afternoons.  \n\n  Excellent route, any very much worth the hike! \n\n  (Note:The line described here is the right route on the face, with newer bolts. There is another route on old bolts to the left. The two sources on Camelback I've seen only mention one route here, hence I am guessing that this is the correct route name. Please let me know if I am wrong and I will fix the route pages.)","protection":"Bolts with two bolt anchor.","location":"From the summit, look for two bolts at a small ledge on the NE face. They are about halfway across the face, and require 10' of easy down climbing to access, which is exposed. Rap to a small belay platform at the base of the route. \n\n  A 40 m rope (fixed as a single strand) got me down with rope to spare; probably the pitch is about 35 m, so plan accordingly. Easy to TR and belay from the top."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,c1fdee82-93e7-5a55-9103-7defbe7f0b10,186b8322-95a3-5a61-a831-156bf794a951,bdead98f-c128-5ab9-a7ce-1afcadd02f1b,1804db43-9725-50c4-8b20-70a4d0f5ee0d","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Central Arizona","**Phoenix Areas","Camelback Mountain","Hump, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.9616,33.51494]},"bbox":[-111.96213932781282,33.51449033981814,-111.96106067218722,33.51538966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113157033","area_id":"GATbQ5clUMSLIHCk0PXuDQ=="},"content":{"description":"This is the Camel's Hump, the highest summit of Camelback Mountain.  \n\n  The two routes here are both on the NE face immediately below the summit.
