Start on 1/4\" stud, moving up past several bolts, mostly without hangers, on a pinned out crack. Free climb over bulge and up to a bolt with hanger. Optional belay here, or link with pitch 2.  \n\n  Pitch 2 (15 m)- Continue up crack, eventually free climbing. Be kind to the bird that lives halfway up this pitch in the horizontal crack; he's friendly. Loose and dirty ~5.7 free climbing gets you to a crappy two bolt anchor- one with no hanger, one with a rusted Leeper. \n\n  Pitches 3-4 (~60 m)- Traverse right on easy but loose terrain, past two old bolts with Leeper hangers. The rock improves the further you go. Keep traversing up and around to summit. There is one new glue in on the summit. A 60 m rope might not reach to it, so it might be best to belay at one of the old bolts mid traverse.","protection":"Rack \n\n  1 set Totems black-red   1 #2 C4   1-2 sets angles 3/8-3/4   a couple LA's   small-med nuts, reg and offset (I only placed two)   ~6 rivet hangers (or 3/8 bolt hangers and a wrench) \n\n  Did not use:   hooks   beaks   blades","location":"Middle of the Ear, on the north side.

Up thin seam to bolt, tension left to second seam. Thin nailing leads to two bolts; continue through crux to three bolt hanging belay.

Continue up to bolt on left, then a rivet on the right. At rivet begin traversing right on hooks and free moves to two bolt anchor with rap hardware. Optional belay here. Just under 30 m to ground from here.\n\n Pitch 3- 15 m\n\n Go straight up from belay on good hooks and a couple rivets, gaining a crack in a shallow dihedral. Mostly clean gear with one or two pins. Lots of bomber horizontal cam placements, finger-hand sizes. One rivet at the top makes the final beached whale move easy. Two bolt anchor with rap hardware, in fairly bad rock. Rap 15 m to previous anchor, or ~55 m to ground.\n\n Descent-- rap from any anchor, or walk off. For walk off, from final anchor continue up loose (and exposed) third class for 10 m to a single bolt and large ledge. Find a fourth class downclimb to notch between the Ear and main buttress. Head north from the notch for a short downclimb on fourth class terrain, or south (looser). With a heavy pack, certain parts of the walkoff may warrant a belay. Beware of lots of loose rock.","protection":"All protection bolts are 3/8\" studs left without hangers. Plan for this.  All rivets are 1/4\" Zamacs.
