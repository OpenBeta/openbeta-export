This one however may be the longest one in Echo Park. On the first pitch I believe I counted 22 bolts total. Its a mix of old sleeve bolts, a few bomber fusions and ten or so rivets. The anchor has two good bolts with permanent lockers on them and two older bolts with tat on them. the slings are not to be trusted...    you can increase the fun of this pitch by bringing a hook for some awesome little ledges. \n\n  second pitch sucks.. don't waste your time. the rivet ladder continues to 5.3 climbing to the top where you'll find a bolted anchor.  \n\n  If you fix a rope on the first pitch, you can do a big and fun swing of the ledge you start on. If you run fast enough you can cannonball into the neighbors pool..","protection":"Biners. lots of them and a selection of larger hangers for the rivets. I brought 6 and then started using nuts..        \n\n  also if you are soloing, you'll find a wonderful crack to make an anchor out of off the starting ledge.
