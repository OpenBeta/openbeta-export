The name and grade might be different in the guides.\n\n  The great thing about this problem is that there are a variety of crimps and slopers. You can use just crimps, just slopers, or a mixture of both. \n\n  It starts on a great jug with decent feet. The right side has a sharp crimp and the arete itself. The crimp is in a better position for the next move, but both options work. \n\n  The grade will vary depending on your strengths and weaknesses. It shouldn't be harder than a V2, though the top out may pose it's own challenge.","protection":"Pad is nice - not necessary.","location":"Split Boulders. On the way to main boulders (see pic).
