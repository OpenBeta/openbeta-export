I figured since it's actually somewhat good climb it deserves some recognition. So in tradition of it being on the Monkey Lust Boulder I gave it a name that suits it.\n\n The pocket guide gives it a rating of V4, which I think is far too generous. It isn't much more difficult than \"Fish Out of Water (V0-)\" located on the same boulder. Which in truth could be harder than a V0-. I'll let the community decide.\n\n Start just right of the high point and mantle up and over.
