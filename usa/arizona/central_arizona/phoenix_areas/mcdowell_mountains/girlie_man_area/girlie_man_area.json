We were climbing everything we could get our hands on. We know there were tons of climbers to test their skills in the area far before we ever graced this planet.

On one full moon night we spent hours trying this thin slab boulder problem just to the right of the outstanding handcrack. After countless falls my good friend craig finally pulled over the top. By that point I was no longer spotting and instead watching his determination and drive play out to be one of his greatest climbing highlights. First ascent or not it made for some great memories.
