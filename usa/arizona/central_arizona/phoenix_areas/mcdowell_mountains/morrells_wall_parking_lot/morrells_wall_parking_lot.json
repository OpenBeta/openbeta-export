Boulder piles ranging from 40 to 75 ft. with several one star (according to Phoenix Rock II) routes.The top of the southern crag (with Back To The Wall) is mysteriously pin-cushioned with a plethora of bolts all over the place, and none of the anchors are rigged for a properly safe rappel (note: a single bolt with a quick-link on it is not considered the pinnacle of safety)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":8,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:38.533Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:34.757Z"}
