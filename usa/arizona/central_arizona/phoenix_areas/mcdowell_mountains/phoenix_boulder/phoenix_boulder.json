It’s got two to three fun climbs in very different style and is well worth a look since it’s only a 10-15 minute easy approach. The boulder gets morning shade till about 10am and is a reasonable choice for early morning climbing on a summer day. It’s also possible to set up a top rope on the PB without having to lead any of the climbs. PB has three sets of good anchors located on it’s summit. No trad gear necessary. If setting up a TR you’ll need 50 ft of cord or static rope (and a little creativity) to extend the anchors and cut down on rope drag; depending on the climb you’re setting up.\n\n To access the summit scramble up the hill climber’s left of the climbs. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:38.532Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:28.138Z"}
