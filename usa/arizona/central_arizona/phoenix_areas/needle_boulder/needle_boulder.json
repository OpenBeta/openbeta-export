Sharp slick holds abound but there's also some fun moves formed by a variety of cobbles, pockets, and edges in the rock matrix. Test your holds before you commit though, as some areas aren't great. The western and southern faces of the boulder are the most promising, while the north side is slabby and where the downclimb is located.\n\n Based on the time of day, the entire boulder (or just individual sides) can be in the sun. Early morning - say before 8am in the summer - is the best time to go, as it's still relatively cool and the boulder is completely shaded by the bulk of the Hobo House formation.  \n\n ALSO: Just as Hobo House's dirt is littered with broken glass, this area is no different. Discarded needles can also be found in the area (hence the name). Be careful! "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:37.901Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:23.201Z"}
