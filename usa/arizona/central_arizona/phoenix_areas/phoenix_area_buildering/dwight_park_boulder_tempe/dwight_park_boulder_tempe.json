The boulder is 8 feet tall, made of concrete, and has an array of chunky molded \"natural\" features; no bolted holds are present. The ground surface is covered by thick rubber matting material. This is decidedly *not* a destination boulder, but if you live nearby or have kids, it makes for a convenient stop. Potential problems look to be in the realm of V-Easy and V0 (it is in a playground after all...), with traverses offering a couple longer options."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:37.916Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:27.294Z"}
