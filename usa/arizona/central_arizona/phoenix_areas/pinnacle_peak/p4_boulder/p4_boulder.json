This climb is gonna be sharp and it takes more tenacity than it does talent. The Crux is the first 4 moves off the deck and is the greatest risk factor of the whole short jaunt.This is a fun little climb that can be done as either a Highball boulder problem (V1) or as a trad lead (5.10aR). Gear placements are sparse and DO NOT mess up your second placement, there is fall potential at that point that could send you to the hospital with broken ankles. This route was intentionally left NOT BOLTED and should be left as so. If you feel unsafe climbing it, DO NOT CLIMB IT. **Please be aware and take care when building an anchor for this climb. It requires specific gear and placements in \"Not Ideal\" conditions. Please be well versed in \"Joshua Tree Style\" Anchors and bring the appropriate cordelette lengths to ensure you DO NOT damage the rock and surrounding area. LNT is strongly recommended and enforced by locals.","protection":"Chalk bag, climbing shoes, crash pad, and your most trusted spotters.  \n\n  Optional gear for Trad Lead; #0.5, 1,2, & 4 BD Camalot.  \n\n*Jtree style Backset Anchor gear for Toprope; #0.75, 1, 2 (2x) BD Camalot, & 0.5/0.75 X4 offset (w/ 30-40ft 7-8mm Cordelette)**","location":"Far left side of the P4 Boulder.
