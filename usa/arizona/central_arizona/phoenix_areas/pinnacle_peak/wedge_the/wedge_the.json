Even today, in sticky shoes, you'll find yourself asking what the heck you're supposed to stand on or hold onto. And with only two bolts, it's sure to keep your complete and utter attention! \n\n  Start the route from near the center of the southeast face of the Wedge, climb up and left, clipping the first bolt, then continue across to the left arete and a second bolt just below a small (4\") overhang. Once you have ahold of the edge of the arete above that second bolt, the difficulty is over, but you gotta stay heads up to the anchor. \n\n  The bolts still have old Leeper hangers and have not been replaced yet, so don't be takin' whippers on this one if you can help it!","protection":"Two bolts, two bolt anchor/rap on top.","location":"Route is the lefthand bolted route on the southeast face of the Wedge."},"__v":0},{"_id":"NOkQXKqhWVGNiAaL0x3IDA==","name":"Naked Edge","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Larry Treiber, 1974","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.86414,33.72794]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"105802670","mp_crag_id":"105792629","climb_id":"NOkQXKqhWVGNiAaL0x3IDA==","areaRef":"RGruavTTUsyRHwODfJymxg=="},"content":{"description":"This climb is on the south east side and is the rightmost bolted line on the face.
