Some of the face routes up on the Peak stand as a testament to the mindblowing footwork of the hard dudes of early Phoenix climbing. \n\n  The Peak area contains great variation in climbing among the many routes, from the cracks of Birthday Party and Bee Gee to the demandingly thin, footwork-intense nothingness of Shalayly Direct. Whatever kind of climbing you like, you can probably find it here! \n\n  ACCESS NOTE: Please follow the rules of the park, including the opening and closing times. We have a good relationship with the Park and the City of Scottsdale and don't want them to get the idea that climbers are trouble!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":44,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:39.308Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:35.520Z"}
