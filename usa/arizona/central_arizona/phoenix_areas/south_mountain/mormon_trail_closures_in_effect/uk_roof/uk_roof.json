This is a stellar roof with solid holds...a rare thing at SoMo. There are other lines out of the roof that seem significantly harder than UK. Bring a few pads because there is a boulder under the traverse portion of the climb. In my opinion, UK Roof is one the most aesthetic and flowy problems that SoMo has to offer.
