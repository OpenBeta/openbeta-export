The grips are really ergo, just flat invite the whole way. Heads up finish. Def nice to scope it out first; I'd also recommend a spotter and 2-3 pads.  Again, too bad the rock at the start is so piss poor.Start on the jug rail down and right. Throw up a right heal, then start climbing nice edges out and left.  Know the moves and save some gas for the choss mantle ending. Just to reiterate, one should have a spotter and some pads for those last few precarious moves. ","protection":"3-4 pads","location":"See description for Crimper's Paradise boulder. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,c1fdee82-93e7-5a55-9103-7defbe7f0b10,186b8322-95a3-5a61-a831-156bf794a951,64ea28d2-8296-5a93-bc4c-cb0a481acf98,9648bb9a-d5ab-50d7-b321-a7b6f604dacc,f8a8f219-04a4-5d49-b7dc-85985a9fd22e","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Central Arizona","**Phoenix Areas","South Mountain","Equestrian Area (Closures in Effect)","Crimper's Paradise"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.01214,33.34432]},"bbox":[-112.01267826866354,33.34387033981814,-112.01160173133648,33.34476966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120286685","area_id":"+KjyGQSkXUm33IWYWp/SLg=="},"content":{"description":"Lone, steep, east facing boulder in the wash up the hill from Delusions of Grandeur."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:39.885Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:30.337Z"}
