Hug your way up a bit, transition to roof edge, mantle up the side facing Arena Foo/Siblings. Don't go around the corner when attempting to top out.Feels like a V3 mostly, but harder than many of the V3s that I've tried at SoMo...so maybe at best a low V4 for the area? I'll let the community decide.Smallish boulder so the dyno is there, but every time you dyno a puppy dies so...that's on you.","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,c1fdee82-93e7-5a55-9103-7defbe7f0b10,186b8322-95a3-5a61-a831-156bf794a951,64ea28d2-8296-5a93-bc4c-cb0a481acf98,9648bb9a-d5ab-50d7-b321-a7b6f604dacc,c2827d8f-a57c-5ef9-872c-1794e006beac","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Central Arizona","**Phoenix Areas","South Mountain","Equestrian Area (Closures in Effect)","Platonic Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1-2"},{"count":1,"label":"V3-4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.00856,33.34555]},"bbox":[-112.00909827626698,33.34510033981814,-112.00802172373302,33.34599966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120298862","area_id":"woJ9j6V8XvmHLBeU4Aa+rA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-112.00909827626698,33.34510033981814],[-112.00802172373302,33.34510033981814],[-112.00802172373302,33.34599966018187],[-112.00909827626698,33.34599966018187],[-112.00909827626698,33.34510033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Right above Arena Foo and below Simple.Smallish boulder that offers a fun compression problem as well as a friendly roof lip traverse.
