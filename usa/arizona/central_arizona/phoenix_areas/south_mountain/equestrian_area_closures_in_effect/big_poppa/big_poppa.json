The FA was done with the best Beta we could come up with but I am sure there has to be an easier way to do the crux, other than the \"split-one-leg muscle-up\". Having at least 2 pads and one person spotting closely is a must. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS BOULDER ON YOUR OWN!. It is very easy to get stuck and the only way to get unstuck is to have someone lift your back and help you land. Either start sitting down at the end of the cave with the right leg jammed deep inside the crack and the 2 hands on hand jams. Do a few moves to get a bomber left-hand jam at the start of the wide crack. Alternatively, you can start standing up with the left hand jammed at the start of the wide crack -- the grade is the same but is more fun to start sitting down. From here, we did not find any other way to do this other than inverting (getting both legs inside the crack with the head down)  in order to reach a bomber jam at the top end of the wide crack. Finally, get another jam at the start of the top out and find a mega jug. Use all your offwidth skills to top out. ","protection":"2 pads, one strong spotter.","location":"All the way inside the cave."},"__v":0},{"_id":"PIpUWYfZWF6ljP8djQ5/IQ==","name":"Crimpy Smalls","yds":"V2","grades":{"yds":"V2","font":"5+","vscale":"V2"},"fa":"Andrew Altman","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.00872,33.34648]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"121502940","mp_crag_id":"120807800","climb_id":"PIpUWYfZWF6ljP8djQ5/IQ==","areaRef":"o2n+7ZUoVk6xm1IQ17GvPQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start on blocky feature.
