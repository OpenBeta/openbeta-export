Good rock and nice flowy movement.  Obvious start, obvious ending. Flat landing. One of the best of the grade at South Mountain.  Start on jug rail down and right. Follow crimps up and left. Morpho move gets you the jug side pull. Top out straight above. Tread carefully with those choss boulders on top.SDS below the jug flake goes at V7 (FA Dave Rosen). The left arete clocks in at the same grade.  Open project is to link Tiger Style into the arete.Beta vid: youtu.be/TimfAU8qZHYGPS: 33.3473004, -112.0094907","protection":"3-4 pads","location":"Up the wash from the siblings boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,24e148bb-4884-59e8-9870-43ce21f1a337,c1fdee82-93e7-5a55-9103-7defbe7f0b10,186b8322-95a3-5a61-a831-156bf794a951,64ea28d2-8296-5a93-bc4c-cb0a481acf98,9648bb9a-d5ab-50d7-b321-a7b6f604dacc,289f2f26-3e09-5042-bf31-3692cc6cecb9","pathTokens":["USA","Arizona","Central Arizona","**Phoenix Areas","South Mountain","Equestrian Area (Closures in Effect)","Tiger Style"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V9"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.00951,33.34726]},"bbox":[-112.01004828683841,33.34681033981814,-112.0089717131616,33.34770966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120228608","area_id":"KJ8vJj4JUEK/MTaSzGzsuQ=="},"content":{"description":"Tiger Style boulder.
