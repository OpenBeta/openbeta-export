Climb left through a sea of thin edges. Topout as for House Cat. - Taken from Travis K's Google Map description1. You can try and start lower than what i've pictured here as the start, but i've had so many pieces rip off while attempting to add on more moves to the main body of the route that I just didn't care anymore. 2. Some of your feet choices may break off, this side of the boulder is quite flakey but nothing dangerous. The main pieces for feet and hands will be solid and safe.3. Try to stay on the lower sea of crimps. There will be crimps near the very top of the problem once you get closer to the crux. I don't believe you're supposed to use them, and it takes away from the difficulty of the crux.","protection":"","location":"South facing side of House Cat boulder.
