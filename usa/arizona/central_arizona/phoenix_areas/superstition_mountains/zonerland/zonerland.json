Later, scouting around on the lower part of the ridge, we found it.  The route faces north and lies near the southeast end of the Zonerland amphitheater.

There is a lifetimes worth of potential there but the bolting ban has put the brake on most development. Most of the routes went up between 1987 and 1990. Expect some run out and a lack of top anchors which is mostly an inconvenience as there is usually a horn to sling or some way down. The rock quality is generally excellent and not what you think of when you think of the supes. There is an unpublished guide that's out there but I think the best way is to wander around the area and pick out lines that look good. There is also a lot of trad opportunity to be had. Almost guaranteed you will have the crag to yourself if you go. Great views and a large variety of routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:37.913Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:49.320Z"}
