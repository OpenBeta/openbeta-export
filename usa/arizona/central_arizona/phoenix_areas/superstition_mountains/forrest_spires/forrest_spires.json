Forrest Spires named in honor of Bill Forrest are those big spires that reside on the south side of Siphon Draw.

Upon inspection three distinct and impressive towers show their beauty, a few smaller pseudo-towers are nestled among their larger cousins. Peter Rock and Bill Rock are the largest while Copperhead Spire and Halloween Pinnacle are just slightly smaller. Your only crowds here will be sheep and vultures.\n\n All of these routes have the potential to be climbed in a single outing if one has the nerves to match the severity of some of these routes.  We have a strange desire towards these older Superstition routes and I have given almost all the three star rating and that holds true for most of the climbs in these mountains, the majority will disagree."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:40.628Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:26.720Z"}
