A difficult start leads up to a tight chimney that you get to thrutch your way up.  Good gear the entire way.   It is probably wise to stop and belay after the chimney.

We ended up getting the ascent clean and true to the book, no hangers were in place!   A semi-tough start on finicky thin gear up to a horn and the hanger less bolt.  Easier climbing leads to the physical crux and again with a bolt less face move (use a wire nut to hitch the bolt head).  Figure out the tricky moves that lead to the nice summit.
