From here, one can either move right into a loose gully and to the top, 40 feet 5.6, or swing left out onto a headwall and climb poorly protected 5.8 face to the top. A fixed rap anchor is found on the West side of the summit. One double/rope rappel gets you back down.","protection":"The protection on this route is vary sparse!
