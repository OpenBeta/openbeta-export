I ended up pulling on a few pieces so have no real authority on the rating other than what my friend said since he top-roped it cleanly.  Lots of rock fell off as I went upward but all the gear seemed decent.  After the crack crux continue to the true highest point of the complex up easy gulley and short chimney.","protection":"One medium piece is nice to have to protect the start of the route before climbing the crack.  Bring three to five smaller pieces for the crack.  Belay off boulders or sling something at the top for a belay.","location":"On the west side of Miners Needle, north of the rappel route off of Miners Needle and south of the route Threading the Needle.  The start is up a chunky and potentially loose section to a thin and somewhat overhung crack.  To the right of the crack is a solid face and to the left is another crack and crumbly section.
