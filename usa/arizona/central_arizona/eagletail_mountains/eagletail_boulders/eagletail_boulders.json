I was hiking around the base of courthouse rock saw these monsterous  boulders that fits roughly into a 5 achier area and about three times as many boulders as the Bend Boulders outside  Moab.  I found no chalk on them. The rock quality is every bit as hard as Heuco. I'm talking solid rock!!! Short and steep, to test piece heady high balls, caves, 45 degree walls, it has it all.  Boulders ranging from 10' to 35'. The rock is bomber!!! The view is spectacular, with amazing sunsets. You won't see a soul out there so bring spotters!! Landings for the most part are relatively flat."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:53:06.017Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:54.116Z"}
