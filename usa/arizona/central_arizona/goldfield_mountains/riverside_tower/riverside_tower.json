A unique formation in the area with a summit only large enough for a few people. The approach requires crossing the river, sometimes up to waist deep water, as well as some very loose terrain. Not recommended for everyone. The tower is approximately 250ft tall and looks like it may feature a couple different climbs, though the rock is very brittle! Caution and helmets are advised!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:33.114Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:44.441Z"}
