By premiere I mean only.  Toxic Wall is a small band of very steep limestone along the Stones River. Managed by the Army Corp of Engineers, this secluded area is situated below the Percy Priest Dam. The area is popular with fishermen and climbers who sometimes leave an awful mess. Be good and pack out your trash and pick up some in the process. Its good Ju-Ju. Toxic Wall is best in the late afternoon during the summer and when the sun is out in the winter. Otherwise its either a sweat/freeze fest. The rock for the most part is bomber and sharp. Most of the routes are short and sporty. There are a few trad lines and numerous boulder problems. Passive pro is recommended for the trad lines as the force of a fall on a cam could blow out the surrounding rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":12,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:48.677Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:58.215Z"}
