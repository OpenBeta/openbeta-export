Climb up to a bush and walk right towards the arch for a traverse. There are plenty of lips and ledges to maneuver over.

They're solid, but be weary as this rock is poor, there are ledges below and a hold could break at any time. Don't fall here.\n\n Great photo opportunities for The Gram are on top of the arch.

After this, go for a big reach above the crack on anything you can grab. Don't forget about your feet.
