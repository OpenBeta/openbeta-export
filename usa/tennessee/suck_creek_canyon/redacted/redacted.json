Amazing position. Pitch 2: Continue up the crack to a small roof. Pull this roof on the right and keep climbing up the dihedral until you reach the \"crazy flake slot.\" The original finish (Gardner/Henley) traverses hard right at slot and climbs unprotected crumbling rock to the arete. A lone knife blade is still visible there from the FA. This traverse, the line of the FA, has never been repeated and rightfully gets an X rating. Pitch 2: Lusk Point Horror Direct (Mark Cartwright, Todd Wells, 1998, 5.10, 90')- At the hanging flake, squirm up the slot on the right side and mantle onto the crumbling face. This unprotected mantle move leads to more secure climbing that trends slightly left. Climb over ledges to the steep face above. A knife blade in a thin crack protects the overhanging exit moves. Belay where feasible.Pitch 2: Lusk Point Horror Direct-Direct (Todd Wells, Rick Mix, 2000, 5.10, 90')- This is now the \"preferred\" way to climb Lusk Point Horror. Climb/chimney directly over the hanging flake and shamu onto the ledge above. Climb the crack upwards to a stance and an optional belay. (Belaying here facilitates communication with your partner).

A good marker is you will pass an old car balance precariously on a pile of choss 60’ off the ground on the cliff line. Above is a dirt road that leads through WMA land to Lusk Point Overlook. This road was a known spot to dump stolen whips and false insurance claims back in the day. The cliff line then seems to dwindle in size and break up and what little to no trail there is disappears.

While this seems like a lot of pitches for a short route I would imagine the rope drag being wildly difficult with a partner no matter what you do but this route is easily done in two pitches on rope solo. 1&2 can easily be linked though.Figure outs your raps. I would not try and rap the route. I went climbers right above the cliff band and scrambled down a gully. Eventually rapping down the face. Double ropes could be nice I used a single 70m.
