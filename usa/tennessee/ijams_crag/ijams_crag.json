Cliff is generally E/NE facing, with some sun early and shade later in the day. This is an old marble/limestone quarry that has been cleared of invasive vegetation and most loose rock that has left an interesting style of, close to home, climbing. Great for an afternoon work-out on challenging, but short, routes or for those new to the sport who want to figure out climbing before heading out to bigger and better places.
