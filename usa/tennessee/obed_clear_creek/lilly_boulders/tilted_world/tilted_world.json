Make a big move to the next shelf, then reach up to a terrible edge, get your feet figured out and stab for a very narrow, slanting mailbox slot.  Find the sweet spot on a sloper rail, and toss out right for a better hold in the break. \n\n  FYI-  Heel hooks and toe hooks are very helpful on this problem.  Also, try not to hang on the slot too many times or you will bleed.  It's more of a finger jam than a hold.","protection":"At least two pads.","location":"On the right side of the North face.
