It is not a quick tick and requires some advanced sport climbing rope techniques.

All 3 methods require more than your average sport climbing effort: 1. Use super long draws on the last few bolts of WB and in the roof. 2.Clip in to the 2 bolt anchor above roof crack and pull the rope through the draws of WB. Use the anchor bolts on the 2nd pitch. (clip anchor long. use a locker or two opposite/opposed biners) Make sure YOU\"RE ON BELAY (!!) Continue up the arete rope drag free. (recommended) 3. Use double ropes.\n\n  A 70 meter rope is necessary to get down from the upper anchor.
