Wall is named after local climber and routesetter Kurtis Watts, who began climbing and testing some of its first problems and sequences.This wall has crimps, slopers, monos, underclings, and just about every other classic limestone feature in between. The slight lip at the bottom of the wall makes for nice sit-starts, after which it transitions into face climbing. Another interesting feature on this wall is the scar from an old dynamite explosion, which has created an incut vertical hold.As for now, the wall is still pretty dirty (especially the bottom below the lip), and much of it is covered by vines and other plants. The top of the wall is easily accessible from its left side, making topouts feasible once it gets cleaned up a bit. This left-side access point should also make it easier for the wall to be cleaned."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:47.939Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:56.452Z"}
