Well . . . in the case of Leda -- longer routes and more of them.  But this little roadside crag is still a worthwhile destination when you have limited time or T-Wall is closed for hunting. \n\n  Like other crags in the Chattanooga area, Leda is a sandstone cliff. The rock quality is mostly very good, and a nice variety of routes can be found here.  Many of these are sport lines, with a number of easy routes ideal for the climber making his or her first lead.  Probably the most popular route at Leda is Jody's Route, also known as Chris' Route, an outstanding 5.10c/d either way, you choose to call it. \n\n  There's also enough good trad climbing at Leda to make bringing your rack worthwhile.  Nice routes to scope out include Ox Stone Crack (5.8+) and Cracked Actor (5.10). \n\n  Leda is on privately-owned land, and a one-time liability waiver is required.  A short distance along the trail is a climbers kiosk placed by the Southeastern Climbers Coalition, where you can find the form to fill out and deposit in a holding box. \n\nEditor's note on ratings:  My experience of climbing at Leda is that many, if not most, of the easy to moderate routes are harder than the grade in the DCA.  In some cases, I've taken the liberty of giving these routes ratings that I think are more in line with what you'll encounter at other local crags such as T-Wall or Foster Falls; in each case, I've also listed the rating given in the book.  Anyone who disagrees with this rating method is welcome to contact me, or better yet, give it your own consensus rating."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":49,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:49.962Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:00.503Z"}
