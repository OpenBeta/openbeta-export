Home to some of Denny Cove's hardest and steepest lines (5.12+-5.14), a technical combo of thuggy roof tugging, heel hooking, and mystical knee bars will help your vision quest to the top. A little orange rock yields to that beautiful blocky and bullet tan and white stone. So take the medicine they offer and let the Shaman of Sandstone guide you to the top. A few of the routes are quite popular, so don't bogart; pass it around to share burns and good vibes. Always double-check fixed hardware, like fixed draws and 'biners, and replace or tighten parts as needed. Located between Between Ladies Delight wall and the Pig buttress, this is the obvious mega-cave."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:50.316Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:22:01.400Z"}
