Named for a friendly local hunter who used shared the woods with rock climbers. Start on steep, spaced out ledgey jugs; reach and hell-hook through big holds to a rest. Roll around right onto the vertical face to a stance. Dance left across orange rock and the technical crux (sequences vary a bit, but it's all there, whatever your size), then bang on through more cool moves, a sinker natural two-finger pocket, and fun movement to the top. Solid rock, uncanny variety and fun climbing make this one extra sweet. ","protection":"Bolts.","location":"The left of the two routes at Corner Pocket.
