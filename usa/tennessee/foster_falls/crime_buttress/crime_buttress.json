Guidebook gives this 11d I’d give it a solid NRG 12a. Close enough regardless and a great route Guidebook says to share the framed anchors. But there is another set of anchors in between “framed” and “if I had a shotgun”. Requiring 10 bolts plus anchors  instead of 8 so I’m confused.  Maybe I used The looters anchors when I climbed framed don’t know. It’s likely I’m a idiot and am using the correct anchors.   Start by using a leftward side pull requiring high feet and reach up and grab the jug to get off the ground and clip the first bolt.  paddle through jugs with a few crimps in between to a thought provoking section  to reach the  ledge below the roof. Pull the guns out and make a few large moves up and left to reach the next bolt. Moving right at this bolt would take you to street crime 11d’s anchors. It seems there is several ways to go here. Moving up and left or going straight up. If you go left you can go to framed anchors  or straight up pulling the final roof and tick tacking through slab to a bolt and anchors.  Which seems to not get a lot of traffic.
