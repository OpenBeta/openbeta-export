An interesting and exposed climb that can be done as a sort of second pitch to Mammy; or, if you have a 70-meter rope, can be done as one long pitch from ground level. \n\n  Starting on Mammy or one of its neighboring routes, topout on the ledge and move up to a two-bolt belay anchor on the wall.  Climb the orange arete, stemming or chimneying to the wall on the right, with awkward moves to clip the bolts on the face.  After reaching the final bolt, move out left and finish on the overhanging face to the anchors. \n\n  As noted above, the 5.11a variation is to climb the arete without stemming/chimneying the opposite wall.","protection":"5-6 bolts, bolted anchors.","location":"Jimmywood section; starts on the ledge directly above Mammy."},"__v":0},{"_id":"96Rs/JAVWsuE9nToe8TOuw==","name":"38 Special","yds":"5.10a/b","grades":{"yds":"5.10a/b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Paul Sloan - 1992","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.68247,35.17715]},"left_right_index":21,"mp_id":"106253491","mp_crag_id":"109078907","climb_id":"96Rs/JAVWsuE9nToe8TOuw==","areaRef":"MYxQO9vHVEOlIy1KFsREOw=="},"content":{"description":"How well you do on this route depends on whether you can suss out the tricky and wandering sequence and still reach the bolts. \n\n  Climb the face on crimpy holds to a small roof; pull the roof and continue to the anchors.","protection":"Four bolts, chain anchors.","location":"Jimmywood section; starts on the face to the right of the Bear Mountain Picnic arete."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,7aba5e4c-5306-56b7-b589-14753da2205b,78033a3e-c315-51f3-bc4a-062bbfc5a320,318c503b-dbc7-5443-a523-2d4a16c4443b","pathTokens":["USA","Tennessee","Foster Falls","Jimmywood"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":6,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b/c"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c/d"},{"count":2,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a/b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":19,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":13,"advanced":4,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":4,"intermediate":15,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.68247,35.17715]},"bbox":[-85.68302012734233,35.17670033981814,-85.68191987265766,35.17759966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109078907","area_id":"MYxQO9vHVEOlIy1KFsREOw=="},"content":{"description":"The home of a good assortment of moderates, Jimmywood can often be crowded."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":23,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:50.537Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:46.739Z"}
