It has some interesting features that make great holds. Unfortunately the top of the boulder is dominated by trees, so toping out is nearly impossible during the summer. With that being said, climbing and coming out of the roof will definitely be the crux of any route here, so the quality of climbing is hardly hurt by not being able to top out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:49.058Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:43.516Z"}
