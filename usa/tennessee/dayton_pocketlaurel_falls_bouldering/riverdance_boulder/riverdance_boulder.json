I showed the line to Troy and he didn't think it was climbable and didn't try it at all.About a year or so later, Troy sent me a video of Zach Galla climbing \"Brass Knuckles\". I was in shock and psyched to see that somebody else believed in the climb that I saw, scrubbed and tried. The line I had scrubbed ended up being the end sequence of the V14.","protection":"3-6 pads.
