Sit or squat start more to the right of the giant rail feature. Traverse this large sloping rail left using some trickery until a good incut sidepull pinch is reached. From here a tricky sequence is required in order to reach improving holds. Once to the left corner of the roof, a few more sustained moves bring the climber around and then up a slabby section in order to topout. Kneebars and toe-hooks could prove very useful on the roof part of the climb.","protection":"3 or 4 pads and a spotter.
