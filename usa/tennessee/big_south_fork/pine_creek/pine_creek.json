The wall faces Northwest and gets afternoon sun. The 200'+ white sandstone cliff has several multi-pitch routes. Many are possible in a downpour due to the sheer steepness and the huge roofs on the wall.  \n\n    Pine Creek is for the truly adventurous. The approach is very steep (up hill both ways) and involves crossing a class V creek.  The trail is \"faint\" at best.  Excellent cross-country skills are a must. The reward is some of the finest rock quality and adventure climbing in the south. \n\n    The climbing at Pine Creek is not for the novice leader. The routes are steep and committing. Most if not all routes require some aid climbing. With ledge fall potential a real possibility. For the advanced climber, Pine Creek offers some of the finest climbing in the gorge. \n\n  Watch out for rattlesnakes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:48.303Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:01.567Z"}
