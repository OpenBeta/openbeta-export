Tallest part of the cliff is in the realm of 50' with the lower side maybe 25', with various places from the top for clean jumps into the water. Water is clear and deep.\n\n The rock is generally pretty good, a few loose areas being fixed and some dirty rock as well. Be mindful of the mud daubers and paper wasps, but generally they aren't an issue. Sandstone with nice bedding structure and good cracks to work with. \n\n Facing to the west, this catches evening sun allowing for quick drying but also heat and exposure in summer. As an additional benefit, though, it makes a lovely spot to catch sunset over the lake.\n\n Weeknights at most will have a couple people, you may catch onlookers from boats. Weekends it may be a bit of a hangout spot especially for cliff jumping but could use confirmation on that."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:23:49.602Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:40:05.785Z"}
