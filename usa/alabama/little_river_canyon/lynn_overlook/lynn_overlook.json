The route during rainy season will be wet so avoid during winter months. There are four ledges that are good for standing on in the middle of the route. The beginning is tough because its a hang start and then up a sheer face. Then at the top there are not many options to place gear and it is very crimpy. The top is where the crux is. You top out by pulling yourself over the ledge and by using a sweet gum tree as an anchor you can belay your partner out. The rock at the bottom is sandstone and pretty grippy while the last twenty feet is conglomerate rock and hard on the fingers.  ","protection":"There are not bolts or anchors, you can set your own up top or use the trees available.

Stay on trails so that you do not step on plants and pick up after yourself.
