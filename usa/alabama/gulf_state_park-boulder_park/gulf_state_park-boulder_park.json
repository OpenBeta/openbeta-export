The biggest and most interesting boulder sits in the back and has an overhanging prow. It has plastic gym holds that are all loose, so I wouldn't recommend climbing them unless they've been tightened since. Some fun V0-V3 routes can be created from the boulder when using its features and not the gym holds."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:18.553Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:38:59.816Z"}
