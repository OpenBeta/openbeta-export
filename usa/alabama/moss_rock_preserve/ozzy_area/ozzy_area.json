For the taller climber, the next part is a simple static, for the shorter--a dynamic move is in order. A deep jug is up and to the right about a two and a half or three feet above the matched hold you're on. This move is the crux. Stick the hold, match, and work your feet up. Sit your feet, into the dish that you matched on before the crux. Lean in, grab the pinches on either side and scramble up to the top. \n\n  The jug that you have to stick for the crux is AWESOME! Check it out from above first if you want to get an idea for where your next hold is.","protection":"A thick pad and a decent spotter with good depth perception.
