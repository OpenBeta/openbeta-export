This ladder grants access to the bolts and rappel rings at the top of the tower. From this anchor you can top-rope all sides of the tower. \n\n  Feel along each of the two ledges for a positive grip before mantling. After the first rebar step look for natural flat spots to continue up. The second half has multiple rebar steps and is easier to climb. \n\n  The bolts are obvious once you reach the top. Note the chopped bolts on the boulder near the anchor.  \n\n  To top-rope the Tower: Extend your anchor from the bolts in order to reach the edge of the tower if setting up a top-rope as the sharp ledge, tree roots, shrubs and boulders introduce a lot of friction to the system. At least 50' of static rope is recommended to build your anchor.","protection":"NO REAL PROTECTION for ascent: No bolts or good trad placements. \n\n  You can clip the ladder rungs or sling the tree if you are desperate, but the ledge halfway up would cause a fall of any distance to be dangerous. Be very careful when climbing the rebar ladder. \n\n  Fixed 2 bolt anchor with rappel rings at the top of the route.","location":"Tucked in the passage between The Tower and Corner Pocket, on the right side. Look for the first ladder step next to a waist-high boulder on the right. \n\n  Preferred decent is rappelling from the fixed anchors but a careful downclimb is possible."},"__v":0},{"_id":"5Pq6MeSNXjmmAWrlvZyzKA==","name":"Out on a Limb","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"Ashley Holmes","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.6746,34.4353]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106767863","mp_crag_id":"106659640","climb_id":"5Pq6MeSNXjmmAWrlvZyzKA==","areaRef":"8iqT3NsZXk2bT5vzvTRFLg=="},"content":{"description":"nice route follows an obvious arete,route starts with some easy scrambling up to the start of the arete,where you have to hand jam in a water groove then pop up to the next positive hold.from there just follow the arete up moderate ground to the top","protection":"set of quick draws,3 bolts and anchors at top","location":"route is located on the back side of the tower,to find the start look for property line on the rock,start there continue up the arete rap off top"},"__v":0},{"_id":"2vvZHFQRWQCLh2UO5kLfEg==","name":"just enough","yds":"5.8-","grades":{"yds":"5.8-","french":"5b"},"fa":"ashley holmes","type":{"trad":true,"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.6746,34.4353]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106827911","mp_crag_id":"106659640","climb_id":"2vvZHFQRWQCLh2UO5kLfEg==","areaRef":"8iqT3NsZXk2bT5vzvTRFLg=="},"content":{"description":"the crux is the start,high feet and crimper rails through two moves to a nice ledge finishes through one more pull to the chains.love this route","protection":"standard rack","location":"back side of the tower,to the right of\"out on a limb\""},"__v":0},{"_id":"uZ8sRmPbX62SIeB+Ro4ETQ==","name":"Float","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"ashley holmes","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.6746,34.4353]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106664647","mp_crag_id":"106659640","climb_id":"uZ8sRmPbX62SIeB+Ro4ETQ==","areaRef":"8iqT3NsZXk2bT5vzvTRFLg=="},"content":{"description":"This route is the first line around to the right, right side of the arete.
