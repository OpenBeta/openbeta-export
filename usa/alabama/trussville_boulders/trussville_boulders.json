A group of five boulders in the city of Trussville's sports complex. This area - owned by Trussville - was completed in late 2017 and was worked on by the Access Fund and the Southeastern Climbers Coalition. Difficulty of routes and possible problems vary from beginner to advanced. All boulders, which are relatively close together and in a forested part of the sports complex, have easy access. The boulders do fall along a disc golf course, so be advised of frisbees and other groups. Brushes are good to have to brush off dirt and moss since the crag is not super well established."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":29,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:17.063Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:08:58.838Z"}
