Most of the routes are readily accessible from the top of the cliff to set up a toprope and there's a good selection of easy lines.  Combine this with a pretty setting alongside a stream and a family-friendly atmosphere, and you've got a nice climbing spot just a half-hour from Birmingham. \n\n  There's another side to the coin, however.  Hurricane Creek is a fairly new area that's largely unexplored, and there's a lot of potential for new route development.  Even better, park management is encouraging this.  So bring your pruning shears and whisk broom, you could bag a nice FA. \n\n[Editor's note:  since this area is not yet documented and the routes don't have \"official\" names, I'm indulging in a little whimsy by giving them names myself.
