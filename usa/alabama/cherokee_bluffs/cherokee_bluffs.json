There has been a lot of progress in making this a better climbing destination for central and lower Alabama in past couple of years. Some of the routes have recently been developed and may need some cleaning. The land was bought by Forever Wild from Alabama Power and climbing is welcomed. Access to the climbing routes is a short hike from the parking lot. Hike the John B. Scott trail or the take the road around the yellow gate south for approx. 800 feet until you come to a post with a climbers logo on it next to wooden steps on your right. Follow the steps up and you are now below Roof-a-lufagus (route #7 on the Topo), currently left side of the cliff line. The rest of the cliff line is on the trail to the right. When you leave please double back to the wooden steps/trail. Please Stay On Trail to Avoid Erosion. Please clean up after yourself. Whatever you take in, be sure to take back out. Please sign the register at the kiosk and write a large C next to your name if you are a climber. Forever Wild would like to know who is coming to enjoy this awesome spot."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":32,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:17.061Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:08:58.405Z"}
