I recently ordered new holds for the wall and started setting color coded routes. Working on getting shoes and updated autobelays. I'll be at Fort Rucker until 2019 and I am looking to pass the torch to someone local to upkeep the route setting and maintenance. I am strictly a volunteer but I am working on getting the gym to hire someone to train as the climbing facilitator."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:17.060Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:08:58.328Z"}
