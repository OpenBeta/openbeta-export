Or you can bail left at the tiny finger jugs (V2 variation).\n\n This is a pretty much vertical climb on sharper than normal rock for sandrock. Start on high pockets and dirty feet. Reach high for a good incut finger jug, then leap for the top victory jug! Pretty cryptic sequence and very fun/worthwhile to figure out.","protection":"Pads/Spotters OR one bolt at the top","location":"This route is at the end of the corridor that contains an arch. If you are coming from the main entrance, keep walking through the grotto until you pass Ascension and see the arch. Enter the corridor, squeezing around the tree, and the route is on the left. Single bolt at the top. \n\nThis can also be reached from the main camping area with the sign across from the pavilion. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,60bc2823-f54f-59fa-9443-f61a87765009,b81f8942-4e04-56eb-a681-84568676c681,2280f261-f335-5d22-962e-570ab8bb83a6,75f1de2e-cade-515d-98a8-ec007f595ce2","pathTokens":["USA","Alabama","Sand Rock","Sand Rock Bouldering","Grotto (Bouldering), The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-85.81654,34.1803]},"bbox":[-85.81708354457886,34.17985033981814,-85.81599645542113,34.18074966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118708859","area_id":"dfHeLsreUV2YqOwAf1lc4g=="},"content":{"description":"The grotto is an always shady area consisting of some decent, short, and hard sport climbs along with many boulder problems."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:21.675Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:05.727Z"}
