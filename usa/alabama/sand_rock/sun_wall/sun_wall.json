This cliffline runs parallel to the road into Sand Rock, and in many places you'll see roadside campsites across the way after topping out.  The wall is actually a series of free-standing towers detached from the main wall; in many places, the gap is narrow enough to jump across and hike back down to the trail. \n\n  The Sun Wall is best known for great sport routes like Misty, but there's also a number of fine trad lines here as well.  It's also a good place to get away from the crowds at the Pinnacle and Holiday Block."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":54,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:18.556Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:38:59.957Z"}
