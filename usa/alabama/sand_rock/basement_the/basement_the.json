The hangers had been removed and bolts trashed. I went down there to get the second and rebolt it when I found that the crack midway through the route takes bomber gear so i left it alone and climbed it as is. Boulder up the face and slot a .5 & .75 in the horizontal crack. It helps to put lockers on these versus draws to shorten the fall by every bit possible as an attentive belay is required to keep you off the ground. I’m sure draws will be just fine if you fancy. From hear take a breath and blast through the amazing crux to the top. If I remember there is still one or two opens for anchors but top it out for bonus points! You can skip the shuts if you place a #4 (if i remember correctly) before the mantle.","protection":".5, .75","location":"This route is on the large block below the south west side of the pinnacle on the valley side.
