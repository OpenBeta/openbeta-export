There's a good range of climbing difficulty, ranging from easy 5.4 up to roofy 5.12. Almost all routes can be easily top-roped without leading, and most have permanent anchors, so it's a perfect place for a beginner's first outdoor climbing experience. And if you're just getting started on trad, Palisades is an excellent training ground; routes like Buckets (5.5) offer easy leading and plentiful protection.  Be aware, though, that the grades tend to be sandbagged; Elephant Crack (5.6) and Box Lunch (5.7) are not for the novice leader. There's no sport climbing at Palisades; no bolting is allowed. \n\n  All climbers must register at the park office and buy a $5 climbing permit (good for three days) or a $35 annual permit. From the parking lot, head for the cliff top near a picnic pavilion and scramble down a fourth-class gully/chimney to the base of the cliff. \n\n  If you need a map of the routes, the park office will supply you with one.  Otherwise, the Dixie Cragger's Atlas is a good resource for routes at Palisades."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":58,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:18.552Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:10.314Z"}
