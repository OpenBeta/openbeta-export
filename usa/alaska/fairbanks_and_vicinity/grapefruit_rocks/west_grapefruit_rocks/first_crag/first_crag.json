The first crux, close to the start on the far left, \"the wet hand crack problem\" may be one of the most enjoyable single-move puzzles (5 moves really) on lower grapefruit. The 2nd crux is about midway, just opposite a young spruce. If doing 'Spawn of Mujo,' the third and final crux is at the farthest right of the crag and has a sloper foothold that becomes impossible to use if wet from rain, so a series of rainless days is likely needed prior to any send attempt.
