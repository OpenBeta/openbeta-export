During peak season this fall can accommodate larger climbing parties ( easily 3 top rope set-ups). While many choose to lead, it is possible to scramble up the hill to the left of the falls. At the top of the falls there is a sturdy tree with a chain that can be used to build an anchor (there are leaver-beaners but upon last check could use some replacing)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:25.100Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:13.768Z"}
