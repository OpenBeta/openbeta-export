P1 start at the base of the lowest wall and climb a 5.9+ hand to finger crack. There are many variations to the first pitch but this crack appears to be one of the easier and cleaner options. P2 climb 5.7 slabby crack to next ledge. P3 offers variations up to 5.10+ but as easy as 5.9 that all continue up to next ledge. P4 offers two variations: climb up and right of wall goes at around 5.7 or tackling the wall directly gives way to a 5.9r pitch which both leave you on top of the hill where cairns are positioned.Â ","protection":"standard rack","location":"Find Cairns, descend to base of hillside from above route.
