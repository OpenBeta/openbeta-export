The two peaks are separated by a large plateau-caldera at 14,000ft that spans three miles. They became \"separate\" peaks when they erupted and caused the White River Ash Incident, it is believed that this gigantic eruption is responsible for weather pattern change and the forced migration of humans to move south and populate the continent. \n\n  Mount Bona was named by the Duke of the Abruzzi in 1897, who saw the peak while making the first ascent of Mount Saint Elias, he named it after his racing yacht. The mountain was first climbed in 1930 by Allen Carp√©, Terris Moore, and Andrew Taylor, from the Russell Glacier.   Mount Churchill was first climbed in 1951 by R. Gates and J. Lindberg."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:28.428Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:15.539Z"}
