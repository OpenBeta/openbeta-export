A broad mountain with a broad face, several options exist to summit, a ridge on the east side leads up to the summit, only becoming technical high on the ridge. The North east face was likely first climbed by a British team in 2011. A second line on that face attempted in 2013, but poor conditions thwarted the two climbers at 8,500ft who bailed just before starting through a rock band."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:00.706Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:40.963Z"}
