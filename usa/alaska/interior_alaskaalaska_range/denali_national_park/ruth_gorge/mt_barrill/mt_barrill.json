Barrill. Ascetically, the lines get 4 stars but poor rock quality diminishes the overall experience significantly. The climbing is burley, not too wet, and contains occasional decent splitter cracks interspersed between gravel. The topo in \"Alaska Climbing\" by Joseph Puyear is accurate but the start is now located above a large crevasse so use some creativity getting onto the rock. The climb has been freed at 5.11 but most parties attempting this should be very prepared to pull on gear.

Barrill is the northern most peak on the west side of the Ruth Gorge.  It's about 2,750' tall from the glacier and hosts and number of routes, most of which are on the impressively steep east side.  The most popular and easiest route to the summit is the Japanese Couloir but beware of poor snow conditions if the temperatures have been warm.  The Cobra Pillar is becoming a popular rock climbing objective thanks to the release of the new Alaska Supertopo guide, but don't expect this route to go down easy.  The success rate on this route is still very low and most parties will take several days to climb it unless they are very strong."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:27.908Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:40.399Z"}
