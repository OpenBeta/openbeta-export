First ascensionst Andi Orgler described the route as \"relaxing climbing in the afternoon sun\" and completed the climb in under 4 hours on the FA. The route contains 1 5.10 pitch, and a whole lot of moderate pitches on good rock. As of 2021, it appears the route does not get much traffic by the look of the rap anchors but this route is very worthy and can be completed by competent parties in a half day. There is a waterfall midway on pitch 8.The route starts on a big platform that is best accessed by often snowy 4th and low 5th class climbing in a gully to the right of the main corner at the base. Do not go up the gully that starts in the main corner. From the platform, follow the topo in \"Alaska Climbing\" by Joseph Puyear. Rap the last two thirds of the route then continue down the face to the left of the platform.","protection":"Doubles from .2 to #2, 1 #3, nuts, 2x60m ropes","location":"Southwest Face of Hut Tower"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,bd7fe3bf-c5a1-5ca4-a2a6-b6c1c9fb0b84,151b2be4-7c20-5e3c-aae8-bc4de562b5b4,0c35bc70-2ff8-53b4-a346-1cd19d8c1c48,7d4bdb53-e6dd-5de6-971e-3f4210e0dd38","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Interior Alaska/Alaska Range","Denali National Park","Ruth Gorge","Hut Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-150.65726,62.92871]},"bbox":[-150.65824804963435,62.928260339818145,-150.65627195036564,62.92915966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120959654","area_id":"fUvbU+bdXeaXHj9CEODdOA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-150.65824804963435,62.928260339818145],[-150.65627195036564,62.928260339818145],[-150.65627195036564,62.92915966018187],[-150.65824804963435,62.92915966018187],[-150.65824804963435,62.928260339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"The Southernmost peak of the great London and Werewolf Tower massif"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:27.908Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:25.322Z"}
