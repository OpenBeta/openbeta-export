There are many ways up the Munchkin, this route trends up the west rock band, but a party could just as easily climb the snowfield, or another rock section. \n\n  Once the ridge has been gained, you must cross a short snowfield as shown in the photo.  A mountain axe is nice to have, as are boots.  We did it in rock shoes with a mountain axe, and it was a cold little traverse.","protection":"Takes excellent gear.
