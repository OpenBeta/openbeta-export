It can easily be led in two pitches, and can be rapped in one go with two 60m ropes. Pitch one, 5.9+, ascends a right facing dihedral before working into a crack on the face. Belay in an alcove. Pitch two, 5.10a, follows an obvious zig-zag crack to the right before cutting back left to a ledge and fixed-nut anchor.","protection":"Light standard rack for the area. Rock is solid and protection isn't hard to find. Fixed nut anchor, webbing may need reinforcement.","location":"To access the route, tour up past the south side of the Munchkin, and follow the base of the Crown Jewels formation as it curves away to the south. The route is on the West aspect of the Crown Jewels, located approximately at 62.686530, -151.222858. It is well worth the time it takes to approach, and fun to check out another valley. Be aware of crevasses on the approach. When you get close, go by the photos. The obvious roof left of the base of the route is visible from a distance."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,bd7fe3bf-c5a1-5ca4-a2a6-b6c1c9fb0b84,151b2be4-7c20-5e3c-aae8-bc4de562b5b4,284e0553-97cf-57b1-b24d-5b02a23249da,473dd140-b306-51bd-b653-ac230d3c15a8","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Interior Alaska/Alaska Range","Denali National Park","Little Switzerland","Crown Jewel"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-151.19908,62.68924]},"bbox":[-151.20006004377336,62.68879033981814,-151.19809995622666,62.689689660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110470255","area_id":"Rz3RQLMGUb22U6wjDTwVqA=="},"content":{"description":"This is the large formation to the left of the Munchkin and the Royal Tower.
