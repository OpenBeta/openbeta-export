It is most often approached from the Sunset Glacier, to its west. Routes on the peak range from 40 degree basic snow climbing to technical routes of 70 degree ice. There is some potential for new routes on Scott, but currently only 3 or 4 have been climbed and documented."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:00.704Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:40.864Z"}
