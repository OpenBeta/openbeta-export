Then there is a 20 ft face to the top of a spire. Climb above the anchor and stand on the top for a real thrill as it drops off much higher on the river side. I had my wife anchor off to a tree in the gully for a belay. This tree is about the same height as the face of the route. This was to protect me from a fall during the scramble part.","protection":"2 bolts and a 2 bolt anchor","location":"Just below the Moore bridge on the Klondike highway.
