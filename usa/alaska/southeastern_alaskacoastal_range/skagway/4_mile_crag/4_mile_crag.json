Much is still undeveloped including an overhanging wall of patina features that could bring Skagway to a new level of difficulty. One notable route sits on the house sized boulder at the base of the hill: it is 40 feet of laser cut finger and off finger crack climbing. Numerous bouldering problems can be found within a short walk of the road. Keep an eye out for the yet undeveloped \"off width crag\" just up the hill and the futuristic overhanging finger crack splitting a prominent arch.\n\n Everything is TR suitable with some long natural anchors, or bring your rack and get it done. Still room for development all over the area. If you've found the Kruzerman route, head up and to the left about another 150 feet and you’ll find the routes. There is some hanging pink tape in spots.\n\nTo get to the topout you can walk up directly to the left of S-Off. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:30.229Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:43.714Z"}
