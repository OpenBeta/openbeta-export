Upon getting on top of the I saw a man wearing either skin colored pants, or no pants at all. I had to do a double take, but sure enough around 7:30pm mid June there was a man wearing nothing but a hoodie drinking a PBR. He was nice enough to put pants on and told us he was doing some light house work, as he is building a man fort on top of the crag.
