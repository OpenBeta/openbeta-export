In order to get up to the area, you have to cut through Alaska Mountain Guides area of operation. Be advised that at any point during the summer a number of tours could be running at any time. This area is for the most part utilized by IWLS and AMG students/guides. If you aren't affiliated with AMG or IWLS i'd recommend cutting through the site at \"off hours\".
