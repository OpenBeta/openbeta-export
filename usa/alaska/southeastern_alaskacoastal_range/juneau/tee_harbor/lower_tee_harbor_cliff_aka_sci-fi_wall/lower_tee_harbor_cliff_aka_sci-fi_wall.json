The is the left most route on the wall, it starts up the entry crack to gain the ledge 10' up, then walk left to the other crack that goes up 20'. Might want to bring a .5 and .75 cam for the crack. Needs another bolt there.. Climb the crack, the route then goes diagonally up and right across the face. 7 bolts to the anchors. Crux is the first few moves onto the face. Use left facing flakes and crimps to gain a good rail.  Hint: Right hand first big flake, left hand crosses to the in-cut crimp, feet suck, just trust and go, then right hand out to the rail. then clip the second bolt.. Good luck. ","protection":".5 and .75 , 7 draws, plus anchor","location":"Left most on the wall. "},"__v":0},{"_id":"ngjiZ6RHXuOcIPEVCr8vwQ==","name":"Astro Arete","yds":"5.13b","grades":{"yds":"5.13b","french":"8a"},"fa":"Dylan Miller","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-134.75635,58.41233]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"119791422","mp_crag_id":"119791295","climb_id":"ngjiZ6RHXuOcIPEVCr8vwQ==","areaRef":"k45FJ/B/Vey2KCX7qRba/g=="},"content":{"description":"This route ascends the obvious arete on the right side of the face.
