The trail ends on top of the cliff and you have to rappel down and climb back up. The top of the cliff is about 1,050 feet above sea level and at this writing there isn’t a trail to the bottom of the cliff but there is a brushy trail to the top.  So far local climbers have developed three bolted routes and there is more to develop. It’s the same rock type as the Tee Harbor boulders. Indeed this cliff is a thousand feet above the Tee Harbor boulders and it appears the boulders fell off the cliff some time in the past.  You can hike to the top of the cliff in about 45 minutes. The climb the bolted routes you have to rappel off the cliff and climb back up. There are three anchor points about 25 meters down the wall at the base of each climb. I think a 50 meter rope is too short to reach them if doubled up. There are yet many climbs to be developed."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:28.427Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:18.098Z"}
