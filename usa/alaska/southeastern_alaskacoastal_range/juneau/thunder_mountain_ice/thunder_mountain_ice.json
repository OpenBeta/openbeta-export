The wooded North end of the face has Steep Creek and a couple of less prominent ice lines with minimal overhead hazard. The taller South end of the face has numerous snow and ice gullies that would be great practice for alpine climbing if they had rock instead of alder/devil's club walls separating the gullies and if the avalanche danger were less horrendous. Cornices hang menacingly over most of the face for most of the winter and frequent avalanches in this zone give Thunder mountain its name. Apparently this face actually has its own website describing its routes. Pretty cool. alpinemonkeys.wordpress.com…"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:27.912Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:40.536Z"}
