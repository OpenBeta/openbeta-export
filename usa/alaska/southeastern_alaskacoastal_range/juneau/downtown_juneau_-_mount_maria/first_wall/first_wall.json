I bolted this ground up by hand from stances. Didn't get a chance to finish by putting in top anchors, as I left the State, but there is a tree that works well. I always finished it by ending atop the large block up and to the right at base of orange face. If anyone wanted to put in top anchor i had envisioned it at chest level above aforementioned large block, with eventual bolted 2nd pitch lead up and to the right on face to anchors for \"The Only Way Out is Up\". Let me know if anyone has done any work up there, I would be interested.","protection":"QD's and sling for tree anchor.","location":"Obvious bolted line 75' above approach boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,a0ac6b10-c13d-5622-86a2-badaba09127a,9a470b33-5dc6-545c-b5df-ac12c52f3b69,896d4ba4-65bc-54bc-89f3-be722433287d,db321cf0-bff8-5cbf-be88-8f4d04e1f95c","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Southeastern Alaska/Coastal Range","Juneau","Downtown Juneau - Mount Maria","First Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-134.4079,58.3049]},"bbox":[-134.4087558453265,58.30445033981813,-134.40704415467354,58.30534966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106500548","area_id":"2zIc8L/4XL++iI9NBOH5XA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-134.4087558453265,58.30445033981813],[-134.40704415467354,58.30445033981813],[-134.40704415467354,58.30534966018185],[-134.4087558453265,58.30534966018185],[-134.4087558453265,58.30445033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"First face 75' above approach boulder."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:29.739Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:43.521Z"}
