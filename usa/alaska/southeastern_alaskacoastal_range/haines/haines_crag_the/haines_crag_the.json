It is an awesome little community that I was lucky enough to visit. After a bit of investigating and googling, my friend and I found a picture of a guide \"pamphlet\" printed by an unknown author which is how we stumbled upon 4 or 5 bolted/mixed climbs overlooking the town. If you know the author and/or any information, please shoot me a message. If this listing wasn't already here for a reason, shoot me a message.  I have no intention to develop this page further. I would also be eager to hand it over to a local if desired. I simply wanted to mark it somewhere online in case there are others looking for some great climbing during a visit to this hidden oasis of a fishing town. I will not post the picture of the pamphlet for I didn't write it and it isn't mine. But I will say that one does, indeed, exist.  \n\n*****\n\n  All routes along the cliff require a rappel down to a ledge and a climb out."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:27.914Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:15.378Z"}
