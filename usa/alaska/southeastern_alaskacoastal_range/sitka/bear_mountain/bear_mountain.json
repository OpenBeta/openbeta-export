It is a sheer wall of vertical rock and ice raging with avalanches of wet slushy Southeast Alaskan snow in the winter and spring. It's classic cone shape (as you can see it from Silver Bay) is heavily windswept and large cornices loom over it's western face. Stretching from the Fjords to 3,747 feet, it may seem small, but it possesses great potential for technical alpine routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:01.072Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:41.553Z"}
