A serious sense of adventure is needed for this one...and a helmet.  This route follows a huge left facing corner system on the shoulder of Mount Alice.

Climb the gully trending right toward the top.  Continue up the gully occasionally kicking steps in mud to the large left facing corner above. Climb the massive corner to the top and exit left to avoid loose blocks. Belay on the top of the ridge. Descent: Hike off to the right and down the hikers trail.","protection":"Helmet!!
