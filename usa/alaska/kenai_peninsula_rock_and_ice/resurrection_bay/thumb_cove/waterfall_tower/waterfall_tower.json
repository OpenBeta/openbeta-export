The climbing tends toward the technical rather than the pumpy due to the extremely high friction of the rock, the three dimensionality of the pillow basalt, and a wide variety of hold shapes and sizes. They all have dirty sounding names that came from very innocuous camp situations, like drinking mashed potatoes or not wearing underpants.The climbs are almost exclusively traditional, and gear is generally spaced a la grit style. If you are a 5.8 leader you will not like leading the 5.8, but if you are a 5.10 leader you will probably feel OK on the 5.8 and the 5.10 pitches.Recommended rack is a double rack of cams 0.1\" to 3,\" single 4\" cam, single set of nuts, single set of offset nuts +/or brassies. Many placements feature a slight flare, so subbing out one set of small standard cams for offset cams will add some measure of mental happiness for the leader and mean more placement options overall, making the routes less sparsely protected."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:57:00.309Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:39.983Z"}
