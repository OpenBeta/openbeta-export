There are dozens of climbs along a few miles of beach ranging from low angle fun, steep, fat, thin, overhung, up to 2 pitches.  Be prepared to fashion your own anchor up top.     \n\n  The cliffs face west so expect early morning cool shade and sun in the afternoon.  Because of the salt water make sure to give your metal gear a good rinse or wipe down to help keep the rust at bay. \n\nBEWARE of the tides & check the tide schedule.  The tide comes up to the base of many climbs and whether you drive or downclimb you don't want to get trapped. \n\n NOTE:  I will be adding climbs to this area soon and if someone knows that a specific climb has a name let me know otherwise..."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:26.171Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:21.862Z"}
