Many of the routes can only be accessed from the lake. Except on the higher points the area doesn't get any sun between October and April because of the north facing aspect. In the summer there is usually a few parties of hikers out at the lake but in there is rarely anyone else there in the winter."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:26.172Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:12.581Z"}
