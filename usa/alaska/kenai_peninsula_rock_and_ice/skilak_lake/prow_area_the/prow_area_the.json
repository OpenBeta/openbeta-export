From here it's mossy alpine 5.9 climbing, up the the start of the over hanging prow.  Catch your breath, becuase from here its on!  As the angle kisck back to 35 degrees, the holds get smaller, and your forced to do a technical V5 off slopers and underclings to the jug out left.  Rest here and fire through the final steep crux, which is a long hard V9 off slopers crimps, and strenuous body position to the sloping ledge out right.  Keep it together for the final 12a section to the anchors.   \n\n  I tenativly rate this 14a, becuase its harder than any of the 13d's or c's I've done recently, and more on par with the 14's.  Hopefully more ascents will confirm this, and start a discussion about developing more hard routes in Alaska!","protection":"11 bolts to a coldshut anchor","location":"Start with a 3rd class scramble to the ledge below the small overhang.
