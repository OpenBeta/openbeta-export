Originally climbed as an access pitch to try and attempt getting above the lower part of the main wall, which was running water. The second pitch of this climb ended quickly in choss and moss.  This route has two variations, one moves left to a wide crack. The second is excellent and moves right to a beautiful zig zagging splitter crack. This route ends at a single stopper \"anchor\" at the top of the zig zag, although gear belays exist at the top of the first section of the wall.","protection":"Gear to 3 inches, one piece may exist for rappelling.","location":"Walk along the base of the cliff to a lower section that has a large steeper section over it."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,21d67e52-b5de-503d-8876-8e16bca1b111,d90fc50b-12a3-5c1d-879f-590f77dbe902,9e3bcfa0-c53b-513e-b80d-6dd0d6c69f33","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Hatcher Pass","Independence Mine Bouldering and Climbing","Upper Tier walls"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-149.27022,61.83738]},"bbox":[-149.27117271892894,61.836930339818146,-149.2692672810711,61.83782966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109148620","area_id":"njvPoMU7UT64DW3Q1safMw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-149.27117271892894,61.836930339818146],[-149.2692672810711,61.836930339818146],[-149.2692672810711,61.83782966018187],[-149.27117271892894,61.83782966018187],[-149.27117271892894,61.836930339818146]]]}},"content":{"description":"This wall is up above the Independence bouldering area.
