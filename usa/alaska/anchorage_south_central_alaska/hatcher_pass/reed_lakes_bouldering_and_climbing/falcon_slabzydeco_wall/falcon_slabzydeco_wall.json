The Falcon Slab (Or Zydeco Wall) is a broad rounded monolith of granite on a sloping hillside, very near the Reed Lakes Trail. Although the route selection is limited, the quality of rock and routes is excellent. Since the original route development, this wall has overgrown with heavy moss, but recent cleaning and rebolting efforts have uncovered the routes and made them accessible for climbers again. This area could use more traffic to keep it clean."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:22.890Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:09.519Z"}
