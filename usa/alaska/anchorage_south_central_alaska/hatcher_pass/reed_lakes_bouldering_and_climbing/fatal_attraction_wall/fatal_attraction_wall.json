The first three pitches and the first half of the 4th pitch are bolted sport, and a beautiful crack system finishes with some trad gear to the topout.\n\nP1 (5.6 35m): Start on a grassy ledge at the base of a slab and trend right up the slab past two bolts, over a grassy ledge, and past four more bolts to a two bolt anchor.\n\nP2 (5.7 18m): A shorter pitch, can be strung together with the next pitch if you're okay with having a little rope drag in a crux. Takes a route straight up the face and right of a small roof through chickenheads with four bolts. Step left for a two bolt anchor.\n\nP3 (5.10c 25m): Move right off the anchor and then head up immediately into a crux. Continue up the bolt line avoiding a sucker ledge on your left, and pull through another minor crux before an easy slab takes you to the anchor. Eight bolts.\n\nP4: (5.11a 37m): Step up from the anchor to the face and clip the first bolt, then unlock the traverse left and head up the face through two more bolts. A crux sequence takes you left to a crack system where you can slot a #.75 camalot or #1 link cam, and then head up and right past two more bolts and into a beautiful 5.7 crack system that will take you to a flavorful finish at a small roof. Five bolts.There is a new higher anchor on the ledge above the Pitch 4 belay. You should be able to rappel to this anchor with a single 70m rope. The route can now be done with a single 70m or a well-off is also possible, but long.Â ","protection":"Pitches 1-3 are bolted sport.
