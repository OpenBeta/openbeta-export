Access by crossing the creek above the waterfall seen from lower Reed lake as if you were hiking above the High Dive wall. Follow the ridge up and over a large gendarme 1/3 of the way up. This a great ridge scramble for working on your rope skills in 3rd to 5th class terrain with a crux here or there you might want to pitch out.  You're never really that high off of easier terrain below, so lots of bail out options exist. Pretty high quality rock for Alaska with lots of good gear & terrain features for pro. Enjoy!Descent: Multiple options exist but we opted for 4 single rope raps from just below the summit which brings you down to a talus slope on the east face. Look for the slung block that will send you down a slabby face to a shallow gully.","protection":"Light alpine rack & rope with webbing/cord for rap anchors. ","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,21d67e52-b5de-503d-8876-8e16bca1b111,25cc71a1-0352-537d-8fbd-440c06c4c5da,d9489342-dd10-5d46-9cd9-fabfd5cf113d","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Hatcher Pass","Reed Lakes Bouldering and Climbing","Outpost Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-149.14378,61.83873]},"bbox":[-149.14473276086184,61.838280339818134,-149.14282723913814,61.83917966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119623835","area_id":"2UiTQt0QXUac2fq/1c8RPQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-149.14473276086184,61.838280339818134],[-149.14282723913814,61.838280339818134],[-149.14282723913814,61.83917966018187],[-149.14473276086184,61.83917966018187],[-149.14473276086184,61.838280339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"An often overlooked peak that looms above upper and lower Reed Lakes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:22.888Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:32.304Z"}
