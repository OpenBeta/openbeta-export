This route is on the detached Barnyard boulder feature.  Starting on the climber's left side when facing the Barnyard boulder from the creek, the route follows a ramp with tundra angling right.  It then gets steeper, climbing a short section of blocks and broken cracks.  Trend slightly left onto steeper, more face-like rock  with chickenheads to the first bolt.  Climb through the short face into cracked rock with a piton and the small ledge above.  Move left on the small ledge until under the second bolt.  Move up, clipping the second bolt, then slightly left to the flake.  Climb over the flake and follow the crack angling right until under the third bolt.  Two bolt anchor as you top out directly above the third bolt.","protection":"3 bolts (old button-heads), 1 piton (old and rusty), Gear to 2\" (set of BD cams .2 to 1 and 3-8 size stoppers should suffice), 2 bolt anchor (nice and new)","location":"Right side of the Barnyard area on the detached boulder feature."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,21d67e52-b5de-503d-8876-8e16bca1b111,25cc71a1-0352-537d-8fbd-440c06c4c5da,9395a870-248c-5986-8187-abad24aa31c9","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Hatcher Pass","Reed Lakes Bouldering and Climbing","Barnyard, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-149.17245,61.83077]},"bbox":[-149.17340251367364,61.83032033981814,-149.17149748632636,61.831219660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110850477","area_id":"k5WocCSMWYaBh6utJKoxyQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-149.17340251367364,61.83032033981814],[-149.17149748632636,61.83032033981814],[-149.17149748632636,61.831219660181866],[-149.17340251367364,61.831219660181866],[-149.17340251367364,61.83032033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"A nice, but somewhat dirty (lichen) and dated (old fixed pro), collection of moderate trad and sport climbs in a beautiful alpine setting.
