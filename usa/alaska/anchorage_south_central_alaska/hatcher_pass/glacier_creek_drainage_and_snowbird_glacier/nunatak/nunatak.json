Not exactly sport climbing. Not ADA approved.Nunatak (from the Inuit word 'nunataq') is a term referring to a rock formation protruding from a glacier or ice sheet. The astute hiker will notice from the pass that, while informally named The Nunatak, this formation is, in fact, no longer a nunatak. Thanks to warming temperatures and melting ice, the Snowbird Glacier has shrunk and instead of surrounding the small peak, now exists as two separate lobes that come together below the formation. Judging by photos in the nearby Snowbird Hut, this change came about sometime around 2010."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:21.379Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:04.612Z"}
