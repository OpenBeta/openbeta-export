It climbs on really grippy rock with an assortment of feet for the crux between small interspersed hands to a long dead-point. The route starts in a black water streak and then moves up to the arete and upper slab, to the right of an arching roof. \n\nCrux Spoiler:\n\n The crux is a long deadpoint with multiple good feet from a small crimp and sidepull to a sloping left sidepull. Follow the arching line of bolts 1-3 through the crux staying away from the arete until the bolt line transitions to the arete. The crux starts at bolt one and is almost over after dead-pointing to where bolt two is, but ends when you gain the clipping stance for bolt three. The crux finishes as you set up and clip bolt three. From there follow the arete and face to the anchor. If you don't follow the arcing bolt line and head for the arete without doing the deadpoint, the route is much easier. \n\n  The crux is approximately V6 to V7-.    Rotate torso left and inward and latch the sidepull and lock down the thumb, lie back hard, adjust right foot and move to positive crimps and gain the arete. Good rest at the 4/5th and then .11 slab 2nd crux. \n\n  OR \n\n  Start the route and transition to the arete on more positive holds to the arete before the 2nd bolt and climb the arete the entire way for a decent 5.11 sport route.  \n\n  Choose Life....Choose your own adventure.","protection":"6 Bolts with new hardware as of 2016","location":"The middle of the Wishbone wall.

If you're climbing this route a few of the following things might have happened: 1) you looked in the guide and saw it had 4 stars, 2) you don't have a guide 3) It looks dry and everything else looks wet, 4) You hate your life and like climbing dumb stuff. Some notes from the FA: From the belay anchor follow interesting and unique moves through a ramp that pulls out below a face. Traverse right to the edge and stand on the giant chockstone to head up the arete. Once at the anchor you can belay here and walkoff to the right or lower back down to the anchor for In Record Time. This is a great place to belay your follower and watch their responses at the strange movement. Here are a few important notes: 1. The guidebook lists this as 4 stars and that is not correct. Its fun if just for the strangeness of the moves, but not 4 stars. 2. Don't fall between the first and second bolt or beware the Blades of Glory.3. Important Follower Info!: Don't unclip the draw that protects the crux move exiting the ramp until you are standing on the ledge! The swing would be unpleasant. 4. You can rappel from the top of the pitch back to the ground with a 60m. Tie knots in the end. you may ask yourself what this route means, no one knows what it means. ","protection":"5 bolts, 2 bolt anchor","location":"Above Record Time and Sacktapped \n\n  climb starts 20ft to the left of the anchor on these climbs."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,21d67e52-b5de-503d-8876-8e16bca1b111,6110dafd-d02d-5e6e-9258-4660ed3aac72,9c1905ce-cf7d-50d2-b740-3359f075fb24,05174315-2358-5a7b-9a16-566ce6c2f2c5","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Hatcher Pass","Archangel Valley Sport and Traditional Climbing","Fairangel Walls","Wishbone"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":6,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":4,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":3,"intermediate":5,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-149.24447,61.82717]},"bbox":[-149.24542240192815,61.82672033981815,-149.24351759807183,61.82761966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113288839","area_id":"BRdDFSNYWnuaFlZs5sLyxQ=="},"content":{"description":"Nice sunny wall up the hill from the trail to Fairangel Gap.
