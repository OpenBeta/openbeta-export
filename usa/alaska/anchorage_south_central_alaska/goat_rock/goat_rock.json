There is a large, shattered/broken horn than provides a solid anchor. \n\n  P2: (low 5th, ~45m) Meander up from the large horn anchor to a large ledge at the base of a prominent dihedral feature.  Get creative for an anchor; there isn't much obviously reliable besides the crack in the dihedral corner (but how this option will work as a belay depends on how you ascend the next pitch). \n\n  P3: (moderate 5th, ~50m) Climb the dihedral or blockier terrain climber's right of it.  Options are likely 5.6-5.8.  Meander above the dihedral to relatively flat and broad terrain near the summit.  Get creative with the choss for an anchor. \n\n  While this route is easy to moderate fifth, generally enjoyable, and features great views; reliable protection and anchors are hard to come by and the rock is very loose. \n\n  The more difficult sections seemed to offer protection where needed, but the route is otherwise EXTREMELY runout and fall due to a slip or loose rock would be catastrophic. \n\n  Descending via the West ridge is recommended as it's basically a 4th class walkoff.  Reliable anchors for 1-2 rappels can be found if not comfortable with the downclimbing.","protection":"Single rack of cams to BD #3 size.
