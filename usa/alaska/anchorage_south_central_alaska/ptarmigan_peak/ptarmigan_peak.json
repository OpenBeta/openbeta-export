Its north face, which features a prominent couloir, is a popular venue for steep alpine mixed lines. \n\n  To date there are over a dozen mixed lines ranging from relatively moderate 2,000' lines to unrepeated M9 test pieces.  \n\n  The two most popular routes on Ptarmigan's north face, other than the moderate couloir itself, are Only Hookers Get the Blues and Ski Tracks."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:30.230Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:28.777Z"}
