It has rich history in the form of mining, climbing, and the development of a wonderful ski trail network. The canyon offers a great deal of variety in terms of ice with everything from moderate routes to difficult testpieces. There is something for everyone, and with a snow machine, the approach is nothing more that a throttle lever away. For the purest, many of the climbs can be reach in less that a hour and offer that middle of know where feeling Keystone may lack. A day in Mineral Creek Canyon is always a day well spent."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:22.891Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:08.085Z"}
