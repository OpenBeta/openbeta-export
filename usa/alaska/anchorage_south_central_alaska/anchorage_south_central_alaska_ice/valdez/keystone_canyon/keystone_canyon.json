Ice climbing festivals started here in 1983 and much of the activity was fueled by the late Andy Embick.\n\n Many notable names have ventured their way up the majestic 800ft falls in the canyon, and there seems to be good ice for just about everyone from test ice pieces like Wowie Zowie, WI6 FA Embick & Tobin in 1981, to mixed adventures like Sans Ami, a serious mixed climb which has seen but a few ascents to moderates like Fang Gully (WI2).Â "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:59.219Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:37.701Z"}
