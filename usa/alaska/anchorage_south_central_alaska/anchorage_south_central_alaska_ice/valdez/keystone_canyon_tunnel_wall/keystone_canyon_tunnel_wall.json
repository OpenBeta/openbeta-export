It is located in Keystone Canyon, yet despite this, the wall is sheltered from the wind, receives great midday/afternoon sun in the fall, spring, and summer and is steep enough to often stay dry when the weather is on the damp side. The routes are generally long and steep, so be ready to enjoy a bit of a pump and utilize the ledges and caves for a good rest when you can. All routes are sport, and the rock quality is good. This is a newly developed wall, so there may still be some dirt and small, loose pieces, but much cleaning has gone into the area, and we are very happy with the outcome. All routes can be ether rock climbed in the summer or dry tooled during the winter months!!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:59.219Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T13:27:37.697Z"}
