This area is probably more known for large scale avalanche that created the \"damalanche\" in January 2014 that ran across the HWY and dammed up the Lowe River causing a large ice lake that threatened the residents and the town of Valdez down river. So yes! this place is very avalanche prone due to the 5,000ft of relief above you that forms Leprechaun Peak.     In the fall before there is severe avalanche hazard this is a great area with a hand full of moderate climbs that range from WI2-3 to 150-500ft in length. This area also has an easy approach that does not require the Lowe River to be frozen."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:19.789Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:03.843Z"}
