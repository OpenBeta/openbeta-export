The one big draw back to this area is that it sees a lot of snowmachine traffic and this can pose a danger as both skinners/climbers and the snowmachiners use the same avi prone area to access the glacier at 4500ft. On the way down there is ample room to find fresh tracks.\n\n The majority of the route meanders through 30-35 deg terrain, the summit pyramid pushes 45 deg. This is a glaciated route, so take care, even though there are very few crevasses they still exists.","protection":"Glacier kit, crampons and ice axe.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,ab1570d4-e0a4-5ea6-972f-3f5a310ba42e,0c4fac6d-7116-534a-8fb0-0d4ec306944d,b0df2f7f-0cc9-500e-b065-2d779bddbb96,fdc360e3-cdcf-5a06-9c3c-c3e3d0db3c36","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska Ice","Valdez","Thompson Pass","Girls Mt."],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-145.77513,61.18197]},"bbox":[-145.7760628480244,61.181520339818135,-145.77419715197559,61.18241966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110791867","area_id":"/cNg483PWgacPMPj0Ns8Ng=="},"content":{"description":"Girls Mt. is made for powder skiing!
