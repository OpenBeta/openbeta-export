In the summer there is a faint trail that ascends up the lateral moraine all the way up to the toe of the DOT Glacier that is marked with cairns, this is also a good route in the winter months. During the snowy months one can also traverse easily into the fall line drainage that runs off the DOT Glacier, in the spring this may be a tarhead HWY (snowmachines). \n\n  The toe of the DOT Glacier starts at about 4200ft, the most resent USGS map from 1984 shows the glacier at about 3600ft. The DOT glacier does have a few crevasse fields and a large bergshrund at about 4900ft to gain the main headwall that leads to the 3rd class ridge to the summit.    Be prepared for weather to move in fast to this area, this basin is one of the first areas to be socked in on TP with clouds.","protection":"Glacier kit, crampons and ice axe are recommended.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,ab1570d4-e0a4-5ea6-972f-3f5a310ba42e,0c4fac6d-7116-534a-8fb0-0d4ec306944d,b0df2f7f-0cc9-500e-b065-2d779bddbb96,1ca33035-5013-5111-8ef7-3531d5997f16","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska Ice","Valdez","Thompson Pass","Loveland PK"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-145.8026,61.13941]},"bbox":[-145.80353159048195,61.138960339818134,-145.8016684095181,61.13985966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110915855","area_id":"HKMwNVATURGO9zUx1Zl/Fg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-145.80353159048195,61.138960339818134],[-145.8016684095181,61.138960339818134],[-145.8016684095181,61.13985966018185],[-145.80353159048195,61.13985966018185],[-145.80353159048195,61.138960339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"Loveland PK is a great place for some early/late season turns or an enjoyable mountaineering route in the summer that requires zero bush whacking. Loveland PK is also very significant because it is the furthest peak West on TP and its South Face drops close to 5,0OOft down to the Lowe River and creates orographic lifting from the moisture laden storms rolling in from the Gulf of Alaska, hence creating one of the snowiest basins that is easily accessed on foot in the greater Valdez area.
