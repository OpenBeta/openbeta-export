If plowed you can park at a pullout right under the wall.  Be respectful of the DOT snow plows and other drivers on the road and donÂ’t park on the highway.  This crag hosts a few moderate and difficult routes.  It receives all day sun yet often has cooler temps than ice in town making it great for warm winter days.  The view form all the climbs here are breath taking and will make this an outing to remember."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:22.893Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:17.412Z"}
