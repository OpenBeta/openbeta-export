It is a gnarly, narrow canyon with a pool at the bottom that can be crossed on old pipes strapped to the canyon walls.  The cliffs on both sides of the gulch are vertical and over a hundred feet tall making it an intimidating place to play.  It also means you will normally have a great story to tell at the end of the day, that is if the hydroplant employes donÂ’t tell you to go home.  The other option for approach is to hike in through the pine trees on the upper right rim of the canyon and rap.  This involves a little more effort but can save the hassle of the utility company trying to shut your adventure down."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:19.789Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:11.797Z"}
