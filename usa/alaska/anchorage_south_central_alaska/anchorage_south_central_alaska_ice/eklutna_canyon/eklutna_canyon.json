The climbs require around a 30-45 minute hike to reach.  The hike is easy.  You simply descend the hill to the river then follow the river until you reach the climbs.  Usually footsteps are visible the whole way.  There will be climbs and mixed routes on both the north and south sides of the canyon.  The climbs range from WI2-WI4 and 10m to 70 meters in length."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:24.005Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:18.621Z"}
