With very easy access and all the ice you want to climb it is a very fun place.  The weather is nice and cool in the summer and in the winter can be very very cold.  The weekends bring out the tourist and the Anchorage crowd.  If you go during the week you will probably have the place all to yourself."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:24.004Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:09.301Z"}
