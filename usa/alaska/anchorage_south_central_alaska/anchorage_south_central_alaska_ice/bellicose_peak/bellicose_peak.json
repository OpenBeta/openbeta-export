The first technical pitch strikes out left on 5.8 rock with poor protection.  The next 3 pitches follow water ice (WI 3+).  The final section of the face follows steep snow up to 50 degrees.  Once you top out on the face, follow the Shroud route to the summit.  We descended the Shroud (on the Peter's Creek side of Bellicose) and wrapped around back and over the Bellicose-Benign col, back down to our base camp below the north east face.","protection":"4-6 ice screws, cams up to 3\", nuts, slings","location":"From the snout of Elkutna Glacier, head up gully, making switchbacks and scrambling (3rd class) up steep tundra and scree for 1,000'. Make your way up beautiful alpine valley to flat area littered with boulders, alpine flowers, and crystal clear mountain streams. This position is about a mile from the Bellicose-Benign Col and is a great place to make a base camp. Follow moraine to a pocket glacier below the N.N.E face of Bellicose. You will see a couloir snaking it's way up the face."},"__v":0,"createdAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:58.369Z","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T12:56:58.369Z"}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,ab1570d4-e0a4-5ea6-972f-3f5a310ba42e,35351a83-449b-5cab-99cc-943da76210f6","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska Ice","Bellicose Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"isBoulder":false,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-149.03507,61.24092]},"bbox":[-149.03600459632253,61.24047033981814,-149.03413540367745,61.241369660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111128457","area_id":"NTUag0SbXKuZzJQ9p2IQ9g=="},"content":{"description":"Bellicose Peak is one of the 21 7,000' peaks in Chugach State Park.
