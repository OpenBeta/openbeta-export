The gorgeous approach and stunning scenery is only a foreshadowing of great things to come.  This wall is a incredible place to get strong with 11 routes generally being long, steep, and difficult.  The rock quality is spectacular.  The cliff was developed to pack as much fun as possible into one wall. Some routes are located close together at the base but they all end up weaving there way into a great line of there own higher on the wall with aretes, corners, slopes, jugs, roof, and slabs.  Everything one could want in a day of single pitch, sport adventure in a pristine wilderness setting.   Note, don't try and climb anything to the right of the crag.  The bolts stop where the good rock stops.  I have seen a house sized block break off the face beyond the climbs and role to a stop near the start of Five Star Everything.  It was the coolest thing I have ever seen while belaying and one hell of a reminder that we are still in Alasla.
