The crag can be see a few hundred feet up the  above the east end of the Runway and is the bottom left crag in a cluster of four cliffs. It is just right of Airport Heights(6 fully developed routes).  It offers spectacular views of the valley, ocean and surrounding mountains but that is about it for the moment.  This is a work in progress and will not be complete till fall of 2014 at the earliest.  A motivated climber can head that way and build a bomber anchor off any of the many alders at the top of the wall and do some top roping.  I hope to be adding routes to this area soon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:29.071Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:19.200Z"}
