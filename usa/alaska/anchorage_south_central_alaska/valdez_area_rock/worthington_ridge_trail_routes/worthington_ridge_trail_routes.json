This climb was first done solo in running shoes and a hand splint after scrambling up from the glacier with no rope or gear.  I would not recommend any of this because that would be f-ing stupid, please learn from my mistakes.  Please approach from the top for this fun climb.  That being said, the route is a blast and can be protected with gear as you shimmy up a 2' wide by 50' tall crack that is like few others.","protection":"Small to Medium Gear, Alpine Anchor... get creative.","location":"These Routes in the area of the Worthington Ridge Trail. From the Worthington Glacier parking lot follow the trail head signs and trail for about 3/4 miles and 500 vertical feet. One of the reasons for this title is due to the Ridge Trail being the safe approach to routes in the area. DO NOT TRY AND CLIMB UP TO THIS AREA FROM THE GLACIER!!!. A hiker and now friend attempted this and nearly lost his life by slipping off the scree slope and pitching off a 50' face."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,6eaa5769-cc0d-546f-9a11-211d3d4dc321,f6384c73-8d01-530f-b638-bd6a9305a63f,153bcaa3-f32c-52a0-9a78-8d17f7f4830d,1792f677-c61a-57ad-946f-04decbf7a402","pathTokens":["USA","Alaska","Anchorage & South Central Alaska","Valdez Area Rock","Worthington Ridge Trail Routes"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-145.72667,61.16636]},"bbox":[-145.72760238633379,61.16591033981812,-145.72573761366624,61.16680966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112363822","area_id":"F5L2d8YaV62UbwTey/ekAg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-145.72760238633379,61.16591033981812],[-145.72573761366624,61.16591033981812],[-145.72573761366624,61.16680966018186],[-145.72760238633379,61.16680966018186],[-145.72760238633379,61.16591033981812]]]}},"content":{"description":"Rappel to these climbs after backtracking from the ridge trail.
