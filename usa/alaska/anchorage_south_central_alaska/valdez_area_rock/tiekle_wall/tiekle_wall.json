This pitch is 5.10a with the crux down low. \n\n  Pitch Two, 5.8   Start off the ledge following a crack system up and left of the belay.  The crack takes good pro to #3 camalots.  There is some loose rock present especially torward the top .  So take care!!!  This short but fun pitch ends at a fixed anchor.","protection":"Bolted ground up while on lead, so bolt spacing is farther than typically found on sport routes.  Trad placements can supplement bolts on P1.  P2 is all trad to a two bolt anchor.  Rappel the route with a single 60m rope.","location":"Located at the base of Mount Tiekle.  Obvious wall on the right side of the major avalanche gully.

It is a bit of a hike and drive off the main road.  Take the old highway as close to the wall as possible then bushwhack for a few minutes to gain access to the avalanche shoot and scree field that will then bring you to the base of the wall.  Make shore to avoid the avalanche season due to this wall being at the barrel of a very large snow slide path.
