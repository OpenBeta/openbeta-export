A good approach trail has already been cut in to access Lookout Rock and the Panorama Point area.  The hike up here is AMAZING and well worth it even if the cliff is not yet finished.   Lookout Rock!! is a  project in the making so no anchors or bolts are currently on the wall.  It can be top roped off alders but be forewarned there are thousands of pounds of rock, dirt, and moss that still needs to be scrubbed and trundled off this face before it is ready for the normal climber.  If anyone wants to drag a shovel, pick, pry bar and a dozen wire brushes up to the wall and put in a few hundred hours of effort we'll have a new crag soon. If not I hope to invite you up some time in the fall of 2014 for some great new routes.
