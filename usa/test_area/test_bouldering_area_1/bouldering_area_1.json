Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that was of little consequence. Her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her.

That was strange since it was obvious the flashing light had been there for years. Now she wondered how she missed it for that amount of time and what other things in her small town she had failed to notice."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"_change":{"user":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","historyId":"63d416c98c5ba6ed6e82cb6a","prevHistoryId":"63d0f68c8c5ba6ed6e81084e","operation":"updateClimb","seq":0},"createdBy":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw==","__v":6,"createdAt":"2023-01-21T22:06:48.476Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-27T18:24:09.179Z","updatedBy":"q+lmEidCQ7ChKGsZ1ORhXw=="}
