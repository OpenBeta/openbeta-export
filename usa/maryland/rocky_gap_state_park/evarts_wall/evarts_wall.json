Topropes are primarily set off of bolt anchors. Developers have placed the bolts so you only need two 120cm slings or two quickdraws to rig them. There are one or two routes that are easily rigged off of large trees at the cliff edge."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:10.845Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:44.823Z"}
