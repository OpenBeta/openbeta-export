There is a fair amount of top roping off three rope points.  When the water is low, it is possible to reach the buttress routes off the main rock resting the the river.  Otherwise, one slab, the upstream one, is long and fourth, with fifth class top ropes up the right hand or downstream side.  The other slab, slightly downstream, is reached by a 3rd class descent from the top between the two main slabs.  A top rope anchor directly above the ledge belay stance at the bottom of the descent allows a series of interesting top ropes.  Shove the anchor over eight feet from the obvious corner, and the routes on the right slab over the water are possible.  Dave's sketch illustrates most of the options on the right hand side of this slab, as does the photo with lines drawn in."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:08.909Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:42.105Z"}
