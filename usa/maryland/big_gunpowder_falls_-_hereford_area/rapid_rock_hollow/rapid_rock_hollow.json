Small but interesting. On a hillside above the bridge over the Gunpowder.  On the north bank.  The climbing is harder than it looks.  Some loose rock. And a bit of slime when it’s wet. But that’s all part of the charm of Gunpowder climbing.  Various lines on the right and left faces. In the middle is an interesting dihedral involving mud."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:09.861Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:04.094Z"}
