The start may be the most difficult part, where feet positioning can make all the difference. Since half of it is a traverse, easier variations of the climb can be created by simply starting somewhere in the middle of the route. The climb isn't very tall, and the top out is flat and comfortable.\n\nPeople have definitely at least climbed portions of this route (there are other videos online), but I haven't found an official name or description.","protection":"The inside of the cave is too small for a spotter, so a crash pad to cover exposed rocks really helps.
