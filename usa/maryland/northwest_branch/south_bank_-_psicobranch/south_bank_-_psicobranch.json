Use slopey jugs to traverse left over deeper water. Work your way into a crack using fist and hand jams towards the back. Continue left into a cool Silo/Cave feature (do a 360 here for style points). Finish all the way left around the corner.Â Had a ton of fun messing around here, surprisingly good climbing. Fun jamming and off-widthy movements on slopers over water. Whats not to like?

Psicobranch is a nice traverse over the swimming hole downstream from the waterfalls by Dirty Ernie and the Tick boulder. The rock here is super unique with really interesting slopers that have been sculpted by the running water over time. The water is pretty deep here (~5 feet) so its pretty safe to fall in. \n\n  I've seen some comments about the water not being clean, but I've seen people swim here all the time and have gone myself many times without issue. Use your own discretion.  \n\n  I'd love to hear from the local veterans if this area has ever been climbed before and what the ethic is here on climbing on wet holds. It's somewhat unavoidable that the footholds will be damp in this area. I know climbing on wet rock can damage the holds overtime. I'd recommend keeping your hands and feet as dry as possible before attempting to give yourself the most friction."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:10.853Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:42.091Z"}
