I would recommend being careful on it though as some rocks are a little shifty.I would be open to changing the grade. When I sent it there was a lot of snow melting and a bunch of run off, which may have made the climb feel harder.Beta here, but also check photo:Start with hands on top of the bottom flake, there's a small edge there. Hook your heel far out left into the gorgeous socket and pop your right foot onto the rock below it. Pop your left hand up to a small edge and right hand out to a side pull jug. Then toss your left hand on to the arête moving up until you reach a jug. Bump your right hand up to the flake and move your left hand to the flake on the left side. Bring your right foot out to the start and dyno with the right hand to the rail. Match on the rail and toss your heel up to the edge to the left of your hands near at about the same height as your hands. Easy top out.Easier beta that many people seem to be using: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSZ03tdKAP4","protection":"Crashpad and spotter recommended.
