Work up to a large shelf on good holds. Use crimps to reach sloping top out on left side of the bloc. The top out is the crux both mentally and physically. Easy climbing, but make sure you're strong at grade before trying it.*caution in winter if its been cold enough there is likely ice covering the sloping top which makes a things a bit spicy.PM me if you know of a previous ascent and I'll credit.Â https://youtu.be/hzGPQY7hd2I","protection":"At least 2 pads and a spotter highly recommended. The landing is not horrible, but on a slope with a small rock directly under and a small block another 2 ft. down slope where you will go careening and smack elbows, knees, head etc after hitting the 1st pad...so not great either.","location":"See the description of the boulder for gps coordinates and context for the problems name."},"__v":0},{"_id":"KFwwLpfrU6m6tsMpyTwaMg==","name":"The Flame","yds":"V0-1","grades":{"yds":"V0-1","font":"4+","vscale":"V0-1"},"fa":"Danny Prouty","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.47547,39.63755]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"120240007","mp_crag_id":"120239951","climb_id":"KFwwLpfrU6m6tsMpyTwaMg==","areaRef":"elK8/ouJVlugthWDWu7lCQ=="},"content":{"description":"Super easy, super mossy, and super pretty = super fun.

I expect most of the climbers that certainly explored this area before me (all STRONG climbers) just kept walking with a comment about some gumbie enjoying it one day, but could be wrong. Let me know if you're aware of previous attention on this one.*Something like Crotch Rocket or Saddle Top would be good names for this also...recommend the sit finish it's fairly ergonomic.","protection":"1 pad","location":"Sits on the top of the left end of the Osprey Buttress."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,0e8c659e-e35c-5f04-a410-a391740871c6,304b7835-2714-58c8-b7c6-90bbe88cefac,7a52bcfe-8b89-565b-a0b6-15835aeee509","pathTokens":["USA","Maryland","Catoctin Mountain Park","Osprey Buttress"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"},{"count":1,"label":"V0-1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.47547,39.63755]},"bbox":[-77.47605390197354,39.63710033981814,-77.47488609802647,39.63799966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120239951","area_id":"elK8/ouJVlugthWDWu7lCQ=="},"content":{"description":"Small buttress with north facing wall and west facing side around the corner.

It was only a flight of two so expect it was Marine Two doing dry run for new pilot qualifying on the Camp D run not Marine 1.
