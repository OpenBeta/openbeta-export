Nice heel hook through the hand jam. Fun moves. Several very dirty holds still.*I suspect this one has not been done so claimed the FA, but could be wrong. Its really anyone's guess. It didnt appear to have been climbed in decades at least based on quite a few razor thin loose holds that peeled off as well as a couple crimps. Patches of moss (99% of which Ieft undisturbed) also attest to lack of anyone's attentions.

Cleaned some moss and several loose holds, but needs more.There are several small boulders and a couple fairly significant outcroppings running north-south in a broken band approximately 150m long. Most of it looks trashy and prob not worth doing and all very, very dirty. I thought I had stumbled onto Sickbay area, but it's still a 10-15min bushwhack due east from here past a couple wide hollers and short rises. At least 2 small outcrops appeared ~25ft and look like they might have decent rock. Its all just so filthy and some bad landings. Worth going back and looking closer might be something nice available when its cleaned up. I didn't fully explore since I was headed to Bullfrog, but was interesting enough it delayed me a while."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:09.866Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:04.308Z"}
