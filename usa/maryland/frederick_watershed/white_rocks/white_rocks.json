It is include here because the approach is a flat 10 minute walk from Gambrill Park Rd in the FMF. The hike in from the Manor Area of Cunningham Falls State Park is much longer and not likely to be used as an access method. White rocks generally faces East. Some walls stay shaded and need at least a day to dry after rain. White Rock has a decent overlook with good views and is located along the Catoctin National Recreation Trail. The outcrop is composed of several faces, some are steep and other are ramps and slabs interspersed with ledges.\n\nThe Left End Routes\n\n "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:12.268Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:07.818Z"}
