It is located adjacent to the Ridge Trail on the Northern boundary of Frederick Watershed. The rock faces south and offers some views of the watershed below. Most climbing appears to be very easy, very short, or very difficult if not impossible. There are also plenty of potential boulder problems. See the pictures for more outcrops here.                 \n\nThe Beehive Wall (35') is located in the middle of the rock band. We couldn't find any starts to get off the ground.
