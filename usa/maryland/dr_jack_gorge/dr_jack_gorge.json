A deeply cut gorge in the middle of flat-ass Eastern Maryland? I had my doubts too, but to my surprise it does exist. Under the only bridge on Dr. Jack road is a steep gorge probably 30 feet deep. If you blink, you WILL miss it. Is there rock there? Supposedly. Is it worth climbing? Good question. There is no good place to pull over the car and directly access the gorge. You will likely need to convince a private landowner adjacent to the gorge to let you park on and cross their land, good luck with that"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:08.904Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:03.545Z"}
