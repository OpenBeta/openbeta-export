It is a largish East-facing polished slab (with various pockets and underclings) which has about three places where one can set a top rope anchor.  About 5-7 lines are possible wandering up the slab between 5.4 and 5.9.  None of these have any traditional names but any combination of them make for an enjoyable moderate polished slab climbing session. To find the 5.9 variations, climb the black upside down 'V' in the middle of the formation, or start on the slab to the left of the right-arching overlap about 15 feet to the elft of the black 'V'. \n\nClimbing Season\n\n  Late Summer or Fall.  Look across the river before crossing to the Rocky Island and make sure enough of the base of the climbs are free of water to access them."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:11.895Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:46.826Z"}
