It is across the Back Channel from the start of the Billy Goat trail to the northwest, though climbing here is complicated by the fact that the rock formation drops right to the water's edge.  Several routes, including leadable cracks, between 5.6 and hard 5.10, are present.  A long sling or static line helps to provide a descent to the beginning of the routes 'Rocky Road', 'Rock & Roll' and related routes. More simply set a top rope on Rocky Road and use it also as a rappel line.
