See more info here.Chief Block boulder is a separated block approximately 50 feet north of Jabba the Hutt in the Cunningham Falls area of Catoctin Mountain Park. With a textured side and sharp aretes razoring up the secondary face, the Chief Block features some fun, shorter routes with technical crimps and challenging topouts. The chimney between the block and the main wall offers some opportunity for practicing narrow chimney ascension.The Chief Block gets its name from the face closest to the chimney - can you find it?"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:10.291Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:05.428Z"}
