It truly is free standing, about 4 feet below and in front of the hillside wall. Jump the gap to the top of the pinnacle. An exposed but short easy scramble can also be used from the back west corner to the top. Anchors are a small tree and gear. To get the top system down, finish one of the climbs to the top. Lower one end of the rope down the low angle west side and have someone secure the other end of the rope to a tree on the opposite side. Rappel the west side.
