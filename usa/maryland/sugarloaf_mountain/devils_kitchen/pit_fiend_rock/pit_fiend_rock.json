It's fun, a bit intense, and then in hindsight will likely feel soft for the grade.  It's more about balance than pump.","protection":"The route will take hexes, nuts and cams. Once you pull past the roof to the ledge, you'll probably want to sling some trees on your way up to a belay spot.   There's a clutch spot for #4 cam in the crack. Given the awkward nature of the climb, rope drag will probably be bad.","location":"The route is located inside the wide chimney on the left side of Pit Fiend Rock.  You scramble for a few feet up to a roof, and then follow the crack on the right up and out, around the roof on the right to a ledge.  then you climb up the dirty mountain to a spot suitable for belaying."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,0e8c659e-e35c-5f04-a410-a391740871c6,34620fbc-d623-57e7-9818-df08ad204300,9794e1fe-cc78-5c78-9bfb-68a7a618e559,ffc4c5ea-72aa-5c4e-93b1-4a385efbee30","pathTokens":["USA","Maryland","Sugarloaf Mountain","Devil's Kitchen","Pit Fiend Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.39262,39.26056]},"bbox":[-77.39320074920413,39.26011033981814,-77.39203925079583,39.261009660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108424664","area_id":"/8TF6nKqXE6TsUo4XvvuMA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-77.39320074920413,39.26011033981814],[-77.39203925079583,39.26011033981814],[-77.39203925079583,39.261009660181855],[-77.39320074920413,39.261009660181855],[-77.39320074920413,39.26011033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This area is pretty shady and doesn't draw the crowds that the Upper Mountain crags (Boy Scout Ledges and Middle Earth) get.
