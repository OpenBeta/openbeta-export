Crux is getting onto the route at the beginning.  It is an easy climb is a bit slippery.  Lots of good footholds.  It's a very good route for beginners to get some confidence and a feel for toproping.  You will be just feet off the stone stairs so people going by are close and often stop by to watch and talk.","protection":"Toprope.  Good trees above to anchor to.  You can walk onto the top of the rock.","location":"Park in West View lot and go up the stone stairs. This rock will be near the top and right front of you - the stairs turn 90 degrees left at it. The Boy Scout Ledges will be on the left.

Work your way around the corner using the horizontal until you are into the right facing corner.  From here move up the flared crack to another horizontal crack about 15 feet off the ground.  From this point the hard climbing is over. Work up the mangy crack to the top. \n\n  This climb is in Mark \"Indy\" Kochte's \"Climb Maryland\" and Eric Horst's Falcon Guide as a 5.9, but I did not think any move felt that hard.  However, you can start in the overhanging hand/fist crack to the right, which is also the start of Darkness Imprisoning Me (5.10b).  Linking that start with the rest of this climb felt solid for the grade, and added about 7 extra feet of burl!","protection":"A couple of hand/fist sized pieces protect the lower crux sequences.  The rock up the slab is dirty and possibly rotten in spots, but you can place larger gear if you feel the need. \n\n  Ample natural anchors, but watch out for some of the rocks on top--they are loose.","location":"Right before the stairs take a 90 degree turn left."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,0e8c659e-e35c-5f04-a410-a391740871c6,34620fbc-d623-57e7-9818-df08ad204300,e2b38067-53fa-5430-885c-ef6fea901714","pathTokens":["USA","Maryland","Sugarloaf Mountain","Pillar, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.39332,39.26214]},"bbox":[-77.39390076229427,39.261690339818145,-77.39273923770574,39.262589660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106876817","area_id":"4rOAZ1P6VDCIXO9v6pAXFA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-77.39390076229427,39.261690339818145],[-77.39273923770574,39.261690339818145],[-77.39273923770574,39.262589660181874],[-77.39390076229427,39.262589660181874],[-77.39390076229427,39.261690339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"It's a pebbly large boulder good mostly for short toproping tho some climbers are working some bouldering problems.
