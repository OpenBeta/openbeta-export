Has the option to do two pitches. The climb stays to the right of Piton. Piton is very close, so you can use Piton's bolts if you really want to. The start of the climb is a finger crack which leads to an overhang. This is the crux of the climb. After getting over the overhang using crimps, the rest of the climb is easier. There are still a few tricky parts, but not as hard as the beginning.\n\n WARNING: I recommend top roping the climb before trying to lead it. You can place gear in the small crack, but not well. If you fall at the overhang, you will hit thew ground. Happened to me.","protection":"There is one bolt at the bottom and one bolt at the top.
