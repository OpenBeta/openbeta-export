No speakers blaring, no tied up dogs, etc. \n\n Hidden in the not-so-wilds of Eastern Maryland is the Mason-Dixon Trail. Along a section of the trail is an unnatural arch, spanning over Northeast Creek, with a small beach and rocks granting dry access to one side of the arch, as long as the water is low.\n\n The climbing is vertical and strenuous, as there are very few good holds on the wall, but many mediocre and bad ones. Bring a stick clip as moves off the deck often seep a bit and are not very secure. Because of its location next to the creek, access can be water level dependent, and also the wall will weep with condensation under certain conditions because of a temperature inversion under the arch. In good conditions the rock is grippy and textured but conditions can be fickle, as the wall receives very little sunlight.\n\n Wear a helmet, not because of choss, but because gravel and such sometimes rolls over the top. Expect an audience if you're there while its warm out, locals like to hang out down here sometimes. And bring a bag to pack out garbage pleeeeaaase. Consider it your payment for having some new bolted climbs around."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:11.889Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:09.298Z"}
