Work up through the crack to a sharp jug rail on the overhang, and use the arete and a right side pull to get yourself to the lip. Traverse out right along the lip for a safe finish, watch out for chossy feet.Very beta intensive in the lower section, and the move to the lip is committing! Difficult to protect well due to the slope, the river, and a jutting rock at the bottom. Bring two pads and a trusty spotter. Great climbing moves, if the landing area was better I would give it more stars.
