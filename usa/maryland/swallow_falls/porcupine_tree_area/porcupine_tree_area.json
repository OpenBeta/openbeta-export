The line runs up the face of Swallow Rock facing the river. The landing is 1-2 feet of shallow water with a soft muddy/sandy bottom. Start either far left and traverse across the ledge right or start in the center of the pillar. Move up and left using good pinches and crimps until you reach the roof at roughly 25 feet off the deck. Move left across the roof using pockets and crimps to a top out, or follow the splitter crack right down the center of the crack. Warning- following the center crack along the roof will move you farther out from the soft landing zone and into a rockier landing area.","protection":"None","location":"Swallow Rock"},"__v":0},{"_id":"Hn1dEDLpWHSAO3fLGzRWfg==","name":"The Sky Moves Sideways","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"Adrian Falcus","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.41857,39.49598]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"118799971","mp_crag_id":"118799945","climb_id":"Hn1dEDLpWHSAO3fLGzRWfg==","areaRef":"7B/8eJsBUQO50liKIjjU6A=="},"content":{"description":"Start low on two bad crimps and move up to a sloping incut edge and a two finger/mono pocket.
