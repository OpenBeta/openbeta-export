Doubles are helpful, but you can lead it with just a #4 and a #3. You can TR this by (1) having the belayer stand under the bolts (which are climber's right, sky facing, and easily accessible from the top) and by draping the climber's end over the central prominence. Not ideal, but it works fine and friction won't hinder taking in slack. Mind how the rope lies over the rock—most edges are rounded.

Tucked away in the woods about one hundred yards west of the road, this area remains secluded from the normal crowds at the Breakaway Wall and Pinnacle areas. \n\n  All of the routes here are about 30ft. or so.  The rock seems pretty solid on the leadable climbs; but due to the lack of traffic, many of the cracks are very dirty.  There are also two bolts (not sure how old or how solid) on top of the north face of the Smoke 'n' Ash boulder that I imagine you can use for top rope anchors.  That said, there are pretty large boulders on the tops of these climbs, so a natural anchor would be pretty easy to set up as well.   \n\n  In the summer months the rocks are shaded by the trees, but the trail and area are fairly overgrown with thorn bushes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:10.845Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:05.916Z"}
