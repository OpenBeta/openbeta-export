Pull through it and follow the parallel left-leaning cracks up to the next bulge. Work your way over or around the bulge near the top to the large platform.  \n\n  There are many variations possible. Some follow the parallel cracks exactly, some work the face on either side. One fun variation is to traverse left until above Mike's Finger Buckets before you pass by the first overhang and then climb the featured green face to the top. The climbing doesn't get any harder than 5.6 or 5.7, whatever you opt to play on. \n\n  Vertical Extension (5.4* PG) An excellent optional finish is to continue climbing up the right-facing wall/arete to the Slimey Ledge.
