This area is home to some of the wildest rock, and has a history of climbing. \n\n  The areas main wall is split into an upper and lower wall. Of which the lower wall appears to have been left for the hardcore climbers, as it's a bit overhung and smooth. The die-hard aid climber would find this lower section heaven. RURP's come to mind. I am unaware if anyone has ever tried climbing this lower wall. \n\n  As for the upper section, one route I know exist, signs of past climbing, in the form of old bolts that go up to and over an overhang.   I would be interested to know the history behind the bolted route. So if any one knows a route name, ratting, FA party, and other interesting tidbits, please chime in."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:08.912Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:03.471Z"}
