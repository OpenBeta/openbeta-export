Here is the guide he created: mdguides.files.wordpress.coâ€¦I found this guide on Robin's website and decided to check out this boulder. This is one of the few places not listed on MP so I figured it was not highly trafficked. The boulder had lots of vegetation growing around and on it. I cleaned off most of the plants growing out of the face and some of the vegetation/leaves that had accumulated around the base. I assume it has not been climbed in a good bit, but it is definitely a fun day trip - perfect for a solo trip because the highest climb is probably barely 10 feet. I brought two pads and felt more than secure, you could probably get away with one for most of the climbs. The rock quality is good for Maryland and most of the holds are quite nice. I did pull off a low flake checking out some of the rock on the right side (mostly undeveloped) of the boulder so be careful. I've put all the climbs from the guide with my opinion on the grades, in addition to one new short problem I put up on the right face."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:08.903Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:41.794Z"}
