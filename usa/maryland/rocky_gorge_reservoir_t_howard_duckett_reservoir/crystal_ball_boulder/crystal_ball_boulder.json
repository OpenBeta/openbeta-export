Move left to a knob just below the prominent crack, throw a heel hook onto the starting flake and reach above the overhang to a crystal that forms a small crimp. Either bump your left hand to the left of the prominent crack to a good sloper in order to reset your feet, or go straight up from the left knob to a highly textured set of crystals on the right side of the prominent crack. From the painful crystal, reach for a good sloper in a big hole just below the mossy slab on top of the boulder. Mantel out, and avoid the prominent crack throughout the whole climb (its makes this route much easier). Consider hopping off after standing up from the mantel as the top of the boulder is cluttered with moss and other vegetation.","protection":"Pad","location":"Right side of the boulder, under the low overhang."},"__v":0},{"_id":"7pRt5HXBWW+em8eW3QiLFA==","name":"Crystal Baller","yds":"V7","grades":{"yds":"V7","font":"7A+","vscale":"V7"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.6296,39.3003]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"118922221","mp_crag_id":"118292300","climb_id":"7pRt5HXBWW+em8eW3QiLFA==","areaRef":"Y4BIPxqVVuiKSai5bVwgEA=="},"content":{"description":"Dirty lowball","protection":"","location":"Starts on two seperate crystal crimps low and on the right side of the boulder.
