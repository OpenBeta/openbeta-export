Sit start on the rail on the arete. Right hand up to pinch quartz, left hand makes a challenging bump to a crimp near the arete—try not to dab. The left hand crimp rail jug a couple inches further from the arete is off for both hands and feet. For a harder project (v6++?) you could climb with all left hand face holds off, skipping the left hand crimp here and going right to the left hand horn on the arete 2 feet higher. Work up the arete on holds that are solid once you find them to top. ","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,0e8c659e-e35c-5f04-a410-a391740871c6,85a15ab1-7371-5caa-97d5-ae29bedb83be,0d7aeaf2-6cf7-5ba2-b324-b5b96cb96556,b82548d4-b14e-5280-a17c-7af488559be6,90811655-0b97-5584-9bb2-284fb7ee9005","pathTokens":["USA","Maryland","Patapsco Valley State Park","Alberton","Alberton Boulders","Prow (Alien Boulder), The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3-4"},{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.79466,39.31519]},"bbox":[-76.79524120240713,39.31474033981814,-76.79407879759283,39.315639660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118007485","area_id":"kIEWVQuXVYSbsihPt+6QBQ=="},"content":{"description":"Watch for choss on any holds that haven't been obviously used."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:11.889Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:46.355Z"}
