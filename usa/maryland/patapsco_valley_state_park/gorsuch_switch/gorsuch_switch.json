It offers a small collection of both bouldering and easy top rope climbs.  The taller top-rope wall on the right is low angle and offers six distinct lines with numerous variations mostly under 5.7.  The left wall is quite steep and broken by a wide shelf 14 feet up offering some easy to moderate bouldering ending at the shelf.  Higher on the right end is a 30 degree overhanging face offering a few boulder problems, including the area classic Riot Time V5.  I started climbing here and around 2009, and it’s likely others have played here prior.
