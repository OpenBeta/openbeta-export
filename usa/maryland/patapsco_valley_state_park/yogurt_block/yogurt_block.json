While this boulder is relatively short, at a little over 6 feet at its highest, it is very wide, about 25 or so feet long from side to side. The rock quality of the boulder is quite good although it can be crumbly in some spots (the pedestal in particular). With easy access from the road, good landing zones and its proximity to Ellicott City it'd a great boulder to throw into your rotation of Patapsco favorites! \n\n  While erosion currently is not a problem at this location it could easily become one. As always, please tread lightly, stay on foot paths, and leave the area looking better than it was found so other can enjoy just as you did!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:10.850Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:45.028Z"}
