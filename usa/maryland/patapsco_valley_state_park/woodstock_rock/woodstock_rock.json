The cave on the left side offers the longest roof problems in the Patapsco extending up to 24 feet long. Woodstock rock attracts both top-rope climbers and boulders and offers a few good leadable climbs for the experienced trad climber. The rock faces north and seldom sees the sun making for an ideal late spring to early fall destination. One draw back is after a long soaking rain the rock face will stay wet for about 2 days as water seeps out the numerous cracks systems.\n\n Due to the extensively established climbs and many undocumented variations there is no room to add new bolt lines nor are there are not any bolted climbs on the crag. The local climbing heritage is quite adamant toward having a low impact on our limited climbing areas.\n\n Guidebooks\n\nClimb Maryland by Mark Indy Kochte is the most comprehensive resource for Woodstock rock.\n\n For top systems anchors you'll need up to 50 foot long systems to reach the many large trees at the top of the rock.\n\n History Climbing started at Woodstock some where around the late 60's and here is a list of the original routes and names that are known Do or Die, Gratefully Dead, Bloody Bucket, The Wimpy Whiner Way, and Mother F. This group of climbers included Howard Kornblum, Joe McManus, Rob Savoye, Scott Mculrg, Ed Bollack and likely a few more. In 1990 John Kelbel started climbing at Woodstock and worked on cleaning the rock off and adding more routes. In The following years Woodstock saw just occasional visit and it wasnt until 2010 that its popularity in both top-roping and bouldering took an impressive jump seeing almost weekly visits."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":18,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:10.858Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:07.431Z"}
