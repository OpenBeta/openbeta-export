If you get injured that's going to be troublesome because of the enormous walk back to civilization. This area is somewhat underdeveloped. John Kelbel as well as myself have looked around the area. The boulders appear in clumps on large hills. Most of the time only one side of the boulder can be climbed, making the walk downs easy. Do not expect large boulders, most are just over seven feet tall. A few of the problems I have found amusing are extreme sit start boulders that require somewhat modern techniques. I would only go here if you have some way to easily access it. \n\npatapscorock.blogspot.com/\n\n  This website has the location for some of the boulders.
