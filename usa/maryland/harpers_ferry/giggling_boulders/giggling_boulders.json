The rock here is of good quality because these boulders have been eroded by the Shenandoah River. It's a smaller area but you'll have a good time on the problems. The stone is sandier/grittier than the quartzite on Elk Ridge and more solid than the rock at the Shenandoah boulders. The area is unique because the rock has weathered into pockets, dishes, and slopers. It's fun climbing.    The boulders are named after stories of hearing a child giggling in the woods nearby. From historic photographs, it looks like there use to be a house nearby to these boulders. The stone wall in the front yard runs right up to the base of one of the boulders.   Remember to be mindful of the river levels before you visit."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:09.450Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:02.807Z"}
