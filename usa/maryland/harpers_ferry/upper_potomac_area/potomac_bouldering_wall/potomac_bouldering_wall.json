You access it from below but can see it most easily from above. At the time of this entry, this wall hasn’t been bouldered on by more than 2 people so it has some loose pieces. But, once cleaned up this wall looks like it will have some great moderate boulder problems on gym like holds. It's actually kind of tall at around 15 feet and when you are on top the only way down is to climb down.   You can just catch a glimpse of this wall down to your left when you are hiking up the trail to Maryland Heights. It’s about 30 yards before the first right hand bend in the trail. But, you can't walk down to it from the trail. You have to approach from below. The approach is a lengthy 1-2 minutes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:09.449Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:02.678Z"}
