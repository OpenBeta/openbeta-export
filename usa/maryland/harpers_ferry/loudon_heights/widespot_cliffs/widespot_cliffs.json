Noisy. Highly visible. Directly on the road. This cliff is easily found because of its proximity to the road and the large overhang looming above the road at the bottom of the cliff. There is a chimney in the back that tends to be wet and sometimes freezes in the winter. A very nice arete climbs up the left side of the overhang on less than vertical terrain but provides exposure. The overhang is not blank but not a jug haul."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:09.453Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:43.246Z"}
