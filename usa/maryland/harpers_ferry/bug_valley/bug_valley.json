It is set in a ravine with a small stream. With very little breeze available, the bugs in the early spring are man-eating. Beautiful view of the Potomac though. \n\n  Update: Have found a handful of boulders with great potential. Will be cleaning and putting up lines over the fall season. Hope to have some new stuff posted soon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:09.451Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:39.990Z"}
