This mountain was named for Daniel Cresap, an 18th century local historic figure. Dan's Rock is an outcrop of the Pottsville formation on Dan's Mountain. The Pottsville contains sandstones, siltstones, claystones, shales, and several coal beds. These rocks date to the Pennsylvanian Period and are about 300 million years old.\n\n The erosion resistant quartzite member of the Pottsville formation is a major ridge-maker in western Maryland."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:08.905Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:41.883Z"}
