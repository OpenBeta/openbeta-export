The rock is granitic gneiss and is typically very very hard; it was quarried however so there are less stable fractured portions and occasionally large loose flakes that need to be cleaned off. The climbing is typically vertical to slightly less than vertical and scarcely featured. Steep talus and dirt protect most of the walls. Most of the walls receive filtered sunlight through the trees all day. If visiting please bring a trash bag, this place has become a dumping ground over the years."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:11.506Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:45.817Z"}
