I soloed it on a top rope with harness rope knots and an ascender. Complicated to explain, a climbing workout to get up on 2 top ropes. The tree became involved as an anchor and posture to make drilling easier. Anyway the bolts are close together except for the first one is way out of reach. You'll need to climb 'They Come and They Go' to clip the first bolt. Then go back to the ground to start up it wary all of the time a short pendulum towards the off width would hurt.    The rock is weak and not torquing it much will preserve the hand and foot holds lowest on the wall. After that scenario, rest or go up and pass over a small overlap.  The overlap top is where the complexity of choices begins at the third bolt. The climb can  be done left or right? At this bolt energy can be wasted away and I think it can be done both ways. It can be very difficult left or possibly not difficult right depending on how you approach it to what you do best. Hint, How would you approach an Elephant? Right on or take a left. The bolt is up and left. Going right, means going higher up than the bolt and not clipping it down left of you. Trad gear up in the off width higher than the second and third bolt is recommeneded. No room fors screw ups on this climb. Left is excellent rock and there's something of nothing to hold onto. Going up and left is not for me anymore, It looks radical and safer than going right. No way I can do the up and left way. I'll try to lead it right.
