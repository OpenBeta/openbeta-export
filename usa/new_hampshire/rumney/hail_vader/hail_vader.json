Several of us spent an entire day cleaning this new crag with hours of on and off hail storms, hence the name.  It has the same south facing orientation as Jimmy Cliff and Darth Vader Wall.  There are 3 trad routes on the cliff 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 all about 30 ft in length.  This would be a great cliff for beginner trad climbers if it wasn't sketchy to get to the base and right above a popular wall.  Gear placements are very easy.  The rock is super solid and the climbs are very fun for their grade.  There are no anchors at the top of these routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:11.655Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:26.592Z","_change":{"user":"jhoZ1HM5QQCLlIW8x9mK3A==","historyId":"64ac20c16d586cdc48db7aea","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
