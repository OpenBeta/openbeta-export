And after climbing it, I have to say, I whole heartedly agree with myself haha. For a short little thing it packs in a good deal of enjoyable and challenging climbing. Great flow on crimps at the beginning with the holds getting better and moves getting bigger as you move up. \n\nAuthor's note: I climbed the FA when it was pretty wet (sponging off the crux holds with a tee-shirt). It was 90 degrees, with 100% humidity (started pouring soon after I topped out. And I did it without a rope (2 crash pads). This is not a brag, rather a defense in case I got the grade way wrong. If you climb it and see the grade to be way off, just let me know. I really am not attached to it. I felt it started at around V3+/4 and eased off the higher you get.","protection":"2 bolts and pigtail anchors.
