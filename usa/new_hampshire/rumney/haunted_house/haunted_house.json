Otherwise its a bomb.    Start on the right side of the chock stone filled diagonal cracks and climb leftward up until it ends. Make face moves up (crux) to grab small tree for a handhold. Climb to second tree and repeat this procedure (crux). Climb to third tree and use it to gain higher holds on wall. Move left to ramp with pine boughs on it. After ramp walk through woods to second rock section. Climb directly up and move right to go back left onto exit jugs. Above this crag is a field of undisturbed beautiful 4\" high green lichen, avoid it by walking off right. Free soloed and my arms were sore when I got done. Another adventure crag climb.","protection":"Lower section has pro and big cams could be helpful. The first two trees are small.
