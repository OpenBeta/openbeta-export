At the end of the day, I was positive this was a 5.10. \n\n  Scramble up onto a ledge to clip the first bolt right of the discontinuous crack.  Climb up decent holds in the crack past two more bolts and you'll find yourself at the crux, your choice of slopers and pumpy underclings with a clip in the midst of it.

Not a bad place to be when the lower crags are crowded and it's not real hot out.  Some of the routes are pretty much in the full sun and some are shaded when the trees have leaves.  Mostly, the crag feels hot and dry on sunny days.  The climbs that I've done here tend to be technical but a little burly strength helps out too.  Also, there is a rap station at the far left of the crag which brings you down to the Yellowknife crag.  It's obvious to look at but some of the climbs on the left side of the crag start from a big ledge, with a big drop, so be careful."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":24,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:11.657Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:33.326Z","_change":{"user":"jhoZ1HM5QQCLlIW8x9mK3A==","historyId":"64ac20c16d586cdc48db7aea","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
