There are two bolted routes on it, they check in at 5.8 and 5.8+. the climbing is slabby for the most part with a few steeper moves. They are fine routes but not really worth the hike unless you are like me and want to climb every route you can. If you are looking for a reason to check them out it might be the only place you can climb a couple 5.8's on a busy Saturday and be pretty damn sure you will have the place to your self. Might be a good warm up if you are on your way by to one of the other western crags up that trail.
