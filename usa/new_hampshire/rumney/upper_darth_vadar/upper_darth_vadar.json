Climb up ledges that provide weird mantel-ish moves. Grab some decent face holds. Continue up face to anchors using some horizontal cracks and face holds. Note- there are a couple well chocked in blocks that moves if you grab them. You don't need to use them and they have been like that for 25+ years - no need to chalk them up with 'X's or break them up.

I'll give it an R rating for the hollow flake but if you can climb gently and place gear in the right spots you should be fine. I'm not recommending it for just anyone but if your likelihood of falling on a straight forward 10a is low and you like a bit of spice, go for it.   \n\n  Just left of the start of 3 easy pieces, climb a corner with a good but tricky red camalot for pro.
