The moves up are  similar to the climbs on the right side of the main cliff. The climbing is a little bit dirty. This climb offers ramps and some wonderful rock protrusions. Plenty of exposure on it. High up moves to start with are high up. A wonderful view after the climb.    A difficulty increase variation to this climb awaits on the same fixed protection a left sided climb on the first three bolts. This variation is on clean black rock and run out distance. The ceiling ahead below the upper slab can also be pulled on up the left side for added difficulty. I would call the whole variation 'Pigs On The Wing'.    We really enjoyed our climb. Finally my daughter got to be in on one of my first ascents in a new area. The crux is getting past the second bolt and the ceiling below the upper slab. The upper slab can be skipped by a nice alternative finish. Go right before slab and pass a pine tree at (5.5) to join up later the regular finish.","protection":"5 bolts and 2 pins rappel bolted.

A 1.5-cam fits before the pin (it came out on second ascent and I missed the pin ) a 4 cam fits between 3rd and 4th bolt. Then it is a safer, better protected ascent but still risky. The top 20ft. ramp (5.0) has no protection and before it is a army surplus ring piton 15ft above the last bolt that is not deeply set.","location":"Opposite broken rock wall besides the gully right of 'Lonesome Dove'.

The climbs ascends slightly to the left of the bolts and not in alignment with them. The pendulum shouldn't be a big deal if falling. Falling going up through the leaves at the exit a climber would hit the lower deck hard. I went to the highest oak trees ahead. I was belayed by Brian Winslow.  Brain led the last pitch. Thee are four anchors on the last pitch. One of them a bolt below the exit from the ceiling is comforting. The other three enable a climber to choose four different exit strategies near the top. Brian chose a higher up the crack exit, like the one I did the first time. There is no belay immediately at the top of the cliff. That's because of the great fire. It's not that necessary there are trees higher up in land. Technical climbing is done at the last anchor, a ring piton that Brian didn't see. He went up and left towards Jimmy Cliff's top and veered in land before it to some trees for belay.  There's a nice boulder problem below these trees not climbed yet.    2-3.5 Friends, Tri-cams would work best in the cracks and smallest TCU's, a few smaller stoppers, four tree slings.    This climb can be done on fixed anchors only in summer with some long run outs and some tree slings and a maximum of 7 quick draws and plenty of gumption. I'd do it with this light rack mostly because I know the climb.","location":"The big moss cover rock that divides the Alcove area from the Junco side.

Both sides of the crags have a number of easy and moderate climbs close together, which make them popular with large groups of beginners that are willing to walk more than 20 feet from the parking lot. \n\n  Notable climbs include the multipitch slab hike Clippidy-Do-Dah (5.5), the bouldery and short Things as They Are Now (5.12a), and Lonesome Dove (5.10a) a must-do four star slab climb that will leave aspiring rock jocks scratching their head.
