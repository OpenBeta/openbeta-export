It's amazingly entertaining and varried. By far my favorite route I've developed. Ok I'll stop now and tell you about the climb. \n\n  It's now the farthest right route at the crag. Stick clip the first bolt and start by climbing up and hand traversing a ledge from left to right. Get a little rest on a knee-bar and/or a jug, clip a bolt above and continue to the right. A section of interesting technical climbing with cool holds (look for the undercling) finished your traverse and drops you on a ledge for a good rest before the crux. Climb up the smooth face on micro crimps past a couple bolts until the crimps pretty much end. Here is the crux, i dynoed to the ledge above but static moves could be done (at a harder grade perhaps). This section might be harder for shorter and or less dynamic climbers Once your hands are on the ledge do a perplexing mantel move and gain the sweet finish hold to the right of the anchor. \n\n  This one was tough to grade so im looking for feedback if you climb it. Most of the climbing is 5.11ish but the blank crux kicks it up a notch for sure.
