Wow, very un-Rumney-like.\n\n Most of the routes here are between 5.10a and 5.11d. Some are very long by Rumney standards, requiring a two rope rappel or 70m rope, but most times a 60 meter rope will get you back to the ground. Another non-Rumney aspect of this cliff is that the majority of the climbing is less than vertical and more like what you might expect to find on the south buttress of Whitehorse, with crimpy technical face climbing. The front of the cliff is about dead vertical for the most part and is home to a couple killer 5.11s including Alaskan Arches(5.11d). Along the gully to the right is the more slabby climbing with a few 10s and 11s. Most areas at Rumney that have high concentration of 5.10s and 5.11s tend to be crowded, but if you want to escape the Rumney rat-race, spend a day at this beautiful area, enjoying shade, quiet and long quality technical routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":18,"__v":2,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:08.542Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:26.067Z","_change":{"user":"jhoZ1HM5QQCLlIW8x9mK3A==","historyId":"64ac20c16d586cdc48db7aea","operation":"updateArea","seq":0}}
