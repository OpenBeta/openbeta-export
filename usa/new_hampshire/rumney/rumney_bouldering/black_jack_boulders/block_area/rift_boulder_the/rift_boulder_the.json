It may not get much tighter than this folks. If you thought sliding under the overhang for \"Dab Control\" was a bit much, you're going to be awestruck when you see this one.\n\n Sit-start matched on a nice aesthetic zig-zagging rail on the steep 60 degree overhang. Figure out a way the positioning to pull on and make a hard unwind to a good hold found on the left arete/ lip of the roof. Stay tight and match the lip before continuing up a few more moves to top out at the apex where another arete comes down to meet the lip.\n\n This problem suffers from a large slab behind it, but if that slab wasn't there, this climb would have had potential for one of the best that the Black Jacks have to offer.","protection":"No pads or a blubber pad.","location":"Finding and accessing this problem is tricky by itself. The easiest way to find this problem is to approach it from the Entrance Boulders. Find \"Bobby's Problem\" spin around and find the overhang with the climb \"Mr. Crawley\". This is a short overhang that faces the trail and is about 15-20 yards above \"Bobby's Problem\".\n\n Now, from \"Mr. Crawley\",  climb up the jugs to stand on top. Once standing on top, one will see that The Rift Boulder is cleanly sheared at this location. There is a steep overhang that juts out over a slab, both the slab and the overhang are at nearly 60 degrees. \"Vaseline\" climbs the sloping rail of this steep overhang."},"__v":0},{"_id":"lNFzgO6FWuSkAJL9Mi5R1g==","name":"The Rift","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"FRA Matt Wallace","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.84177,43.80299]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"108059711","mp_crag_id":"120041918","climb_id":"lNFzgO6FWuSkAJL9Mi5R1g==","areaRef":"MQDwx8iaUwWTPtPV1C96XQ=="},"content":{"description":"Start low in the wide crack with good feet, work your way out of the crack jamming and laybacking to the crux move to the lip.","protection":"Pad and spotter.","location":"When you approach The The Block walk left to the left of The Cock Block squeezing between that problem and a tree. when you get to the end of that wall turn right and follow the back dirty face to the end.
