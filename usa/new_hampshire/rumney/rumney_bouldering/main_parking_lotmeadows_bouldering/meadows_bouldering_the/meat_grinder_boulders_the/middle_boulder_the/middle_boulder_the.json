Pull on and make a right hand move out to a 3 finger packet in the crack. From here move left hand out to a good but slightly slopey flake. Then encounter the crux. move to the lip using cool foot beta, once hit the lip make two moves up to a jug and drop off. \n\n  The first two moves will feel like the crux if you do not get the beta right think kneebar :) \n\n  The problem could not be topped out due to snow and ice but will be able to top out once the snow is gone and when that happens it will probably get another star and may be a bump up in grade. \n\n  There is a really hard looking variation that would come in from the left on a long horizontal roof and meet with this problem at the lip. Looks like it will be at least V8 any takers?","protection":"Pads for uneven landing and spotter.","location":"On the left side of the Middle Boulder clamber in between two coffee table size boulders to the little roof."},"__v":0},{"_id":"ASG0BcwFWC6XtkyM1cycag==","name":"Renegade","yds":"V3","grades":{"yds":"V3","font":"6A","vscale":"V3"},"fa":"Matt Wallace 1/30/11","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.83902,43.80241]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"107024719","mp_crag_id":"107024705","climb_id":"ASG0BcwFWC6XtkyM1cycag==","areaRef":"kX0DntwtVPeJi5RTYddMHA=="},"content":{"description":"The crux is the first move.
