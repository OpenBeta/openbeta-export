The rock is covered with positive holds and big pockets and has the potential to be a super fun area for steep jug hauling. Classic lines have been climbed over the years, but none recorded yet.  It is still a very raw area so doesn't get the attention it deserves. To get the most out of the area, expect to spend time with your scraper and brushes and maybe  a hammer to rub over the fish hook spines on the pockets. \n\n  You can also get here by following the trail west for a few minutes from the Main Cliff's Venus Wall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:12.229Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:01.786Z"}
