From here cross up to a slopey hold above you head and position your feet for a large unwind dynamic move up and out right to a large flat rail. Not committing or falling here could have severe consequences. Once the jug is latched, match and do a few more hard moves up to the lip of the boulder/cliff. The top of the rock is slopey and not as good as you'd like. Stay tight and figure out a way to mantle the beast.","protection":"If your name is Vasya, you don't need any.
