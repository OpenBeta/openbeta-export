Percival cliff gets a large amount of sun. It definitely drys quickly which is great but it can get very hot. Fortunately there is a large boulder opposing the center of the cliff and trees to the left of the cliff that offer shade to the belayer. Because of the fairly long approach it is unlikely you'll run into other climbers but if you're looking to go hiking and climbing, it's a great area.  \n\n  Height is about 60ft.  \n\n  Walking off or toprope set up is very easy.  \n\n  The cliffs are either top-rope or trad. Bring a standard rack with extra small stuff."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:13.185Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:45.237Z"}
