Used to have a bolted arete that was very hard but also rather controversial. It was a great climb but just did not fit in the area. Could be bouldered now - nice V5 ? highball. Just superb rock and some super hard stuff to do. The back side usually has a tree limb leaning against it. I'll give that slab 11c."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:13.186Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:49.401Z"}
