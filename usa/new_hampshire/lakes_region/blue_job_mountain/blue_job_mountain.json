Dorothy was only four when she climbed it the first time. the dome shape definitely helped with her confidence in the rope as a new climber. Still some more challenging moves if you're only little. The ledge in the middle was nice as it meant I could climb up and stand right beneath her for moral support. ","protection":"Top rope off some trees or the cracks at the top. either would work. You would probably need around thirty feet of static line to make the anchor from the trees. Or if you're a confident climber just boulder it.","location":"Start on the small boulders at the base of the cliff, the route begins basically at the point between the two trees. There are a few small crimps for your hands and basically nothing for your feet except smearing or using some texture in the rock. The hardest part is just getting off the ground. Once you have a hand on the big ledge the route is basically over. Start all the way to the left below the ledge and traverse around it for a much more technical climb. "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,f3779a70-6ea4-5c34-b506-d46699ecf026,9c48fc7d-6e24-5a9a-bc36-db28855948a3","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","Lakes Region","Blue Job Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.3"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.11715,43.33763]},"bbox":[-71.11776824071326,43.33718033981814,-71.11653175928672,43.33807966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120419544","area_id":"nEj8fW4kWpq8NtsohVlIow==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.11776824071326,43.33718033981814],[-71.11653175928672,43.33718033981814],[-71.11653175928672,43.33807966018186],[-71.11776824071326,43.33807966018186],[-71.11776824071326,43.33718033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Small sloped rock face just below the summit of little blue. A few easy face climbs and one or two short technical boulders. We brought top roping equipment for safety, mostly for convenience as a crash pad would be difficult to haul out there and hard to place. A few good trees at the top of the main face make for good anchors, or place some trad gear in the plentiful cracks. This was my four year -olds first outdoor climb.
