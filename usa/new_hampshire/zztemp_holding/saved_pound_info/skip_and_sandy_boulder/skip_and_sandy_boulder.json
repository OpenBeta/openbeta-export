From here make sizable move to good hand for right, adjust yourself and make dead-point to a jugish hold up the arete rock over and top out. \n\n  The crux is getting off the ground and the dead-point at the end. This route has cool flow, and think heel hook whenever you are stuck and maybe a drop knee.  \n\n  This route was shown to me by someone who originally told me they thought it would go at V7, well its not that hard, but the first move can be discouraging because it could take a while to get, one you get it, you will love the move.
