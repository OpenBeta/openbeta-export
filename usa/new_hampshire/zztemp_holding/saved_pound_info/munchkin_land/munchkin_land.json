Munchkin Land is to the right ( if you are looking from the road) of the main part of the pound.

To do this you use a slopey arete with your left hand and a crimp that is at a weird angle with your right. Heel hook around the arete with your left foot  and with your right foot use the outside of your foot on a small hold just right of the arete. From this awkward feeling position stand up bringing your right hand to a small rounded crimp out right on the right face, then move your left hand up the arete to a good pinch, then adjust your feet and go to the huge topout.","protection":"Pad and watch out for the rock behind you.","location":"In Munchkin Land, go to Gary's Fortune then walk right around it for about 20 feet until you see a low lying boulder on your right that gradully gets taller as you walk by it, up to about 10 feet.
