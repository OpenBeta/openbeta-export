The cliff is north of Christmas Mountain Road and is apparently on private property. \n\n  The cliff was developed in the early 1980s by Steve Larson, Kurt Winkler, Todd Swain, Brooks Bicknell and other local climbers. There are at least 20 routes on the cliff. \n\n  The cliff is barely visible from Route 16 when the leaves are on the trees, but can be better seen after the leaves have dropped."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:16.106Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:53.316Z"}
