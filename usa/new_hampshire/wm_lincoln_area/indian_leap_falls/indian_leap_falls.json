The crux comes close to the top about 20' off the water. The topout is solid and pretty secure although the time I fell was in the top lieback crack/arete.  \n\n  I've been told the water is too deep to ever touch bottom but always be aware of your fall zone and scope it out before trying it.","protection":"None. This is a deep water solo climb. Your only protection is water and your ability to swim.","location":"The climb starts out on the big wedged boulder beneath the downstream bridge. Shoe up and chalk up on the boulder. Next, chimney down until you can get into a big horizontal crack. Traverse out over the the big pool of Agassiz Basin until you are out over the water. The route climbs up and heads through a small bush a few moves into the route. Once below the steep overhang, do some face moves heading right towards the arete.
