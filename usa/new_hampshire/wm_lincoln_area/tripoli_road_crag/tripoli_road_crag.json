Note- MtnPrjct has been careful to distinguish between Bradley White and Brad White ( owner and head honcho of the IME climbing school ) Both have done much in the NH outback, but Bradley’s are usually a bit more adventurous and eclectic!….as in self admitted, non-reversible 5.7-5.8 moves! ) Horror show poison ivy and large blackberry bushes in a dangerous giant boulder field is below this metamorphic rock crag. The boulders are featureless. Crag has a large ceiling seen from I93. The ceiling has no direct way to reach it though.
