I was just trying to get to the top in one piece while climbing alone. There is potential for better routes, but the rock quality is bad. \n\nBad\n\n Bushwhack 1.5 hours to base. \n\n  3 pitches. \n\n  1 - 5.3 slab. Trend up and right till slab ends, step left across gully do a few moves and gainy sandy buttress with a tree on the right. \n\n  2 - 5.6 slab to roof. From the top of the buttress Follow slab up to roof. Pro is sparse and rock is friable. Pull roof with thoughtful feet then swim up muddy grass to a sturdy tree. \n\n  3 - 5.5 easy roof. Directly above tree study the roof system, walk up grass slope to roof, protect, pull. Stay left, roof to right has tons of loose blocks ready to fall down like a game of jenga.  \n\n  A crack splits the roof that you can protect easily and 2 moves and you're over. Follow slabs to tree line. \n\n  Bushwhack out. \n\n  Wall and face have no access from roads or anything else at this time. There are no trails except faint game trails. This is a brutal bush whack. \n\n  Just adding this for my milleage records. This climb is crap, but there's potential for actual aesthetic lines here. \n\n  note to self - secure access and return.","protection":"Trad","location":"bushwhack for 1.5 hours in.
