It's super popular with locals and a fun place to cool off when it's hot. Among the tumbling water and rocks there is a steep section of relatively chossy rock, with a nice face that has a few lines on it. The rock is pretty chossy and friable tho. I cleaned it last year, and besides lichen and bushes a lot of rock came off it too.\n\n As it is town property please do not bolt this area. The trees are robust enough at the cliff top for top roping.\n\n Be mindful of others while you're there, if the weather is nice you'll probably see other people. Pack out trash if you can.\n\n This place isn't worth seeking out, but if you're in the area it's a really fun spot to climb. It's a cool setting no matter the time of year, in the winter the tumbling water ices up (tho not completely) and in the summer the sun shines right down into the heart of the gorge."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:11.671Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:01.495Z"}
