Nothing worth driving out of your way to, but has some potential if you live in the area. No clue if the cliff has any \"established routes\" on it, but I'd like to think not. There are no bolts or anchors. There is a light closet of trees to build anchors on at the top but none are big enough for a single point anchor. There is potential for about four lines with a couple link ups. Probably a max of 7-10 routes in on the cliff. I climbed a 5.10a/b route that goes straight up the center of the face on top rope. It would be sweet to get some bolts in to truly top it out. Let me know if you have any information or know of anyone who has sent these routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:08.542Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:19.646Z"}
