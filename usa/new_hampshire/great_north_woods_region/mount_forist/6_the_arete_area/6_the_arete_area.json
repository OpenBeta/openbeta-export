While listed as a \"sport\" climb, that's only because it's \"bolts only\" protection; expect reasonable distances between bolts.\n\n START- Follow the path down to the toe of the cliff to a nice base \"staging area\". A clean grey slab with 2 bolts down low. To the left is a dirt ramp leading to a birch tree, to the right a pine tree about 40 ft up. High above is the arete, the key feature of the route.\n\n P1 - Thin, bouldery moves (5.8- / 5.8) lead past the two bolts. Step right to a thin curving flake (piton in the bottom) and then up to another bolt sort of left-ish. The bolts get a little further spaced in the super-enjoyable, moderate middle section as you climb left-ish towards a large left-facing corner that forms the left side of the arete. Up the corner a few moves, then step right onto the arete. Continue up the steepening \"headwall\" to the final bolt. Directly over the bolt (crux 5.8) [or, alternately, to the right on knobs 5.7+ / 5.8-] leads to the chain anchor. 170-180 ft 5.8\n\n Descent - rap the route with a single 60m as described below. \n\n \"Bob A\" COMMENTs: \"You can rap the route with one rope in two raps.   Look for a two bolt anchor with chains to climbers left of the arête out on the slab.\" Used this today..very nice.  It is about 15 ft left of the arete, a little bit higher than the first bolt on the arete (the bolt that protects the move back right onto the arete from the corner. ) No reason why this couldn't be used as a belay on the way up also.  Especially if you don't have the requisite number of draws.
