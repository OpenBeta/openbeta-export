Simply climb the route to the anchor, passing old bolts.

R Hall NH Admin. \n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =[2016 NOTE: Somewhere along the line this climb got \"cut in half\", probably because the \"natural, straight up\" line above the \"pitch 1\" anchor is about 5.5 -5.6 R and totally out of context with \"pitch 1.\" But the \"second pitch\" (or, almost certainly, the second half of a one-pitch FA) goes up a dike to the right of the \"straight up line\" above the anchor.Webster's Editions 2 and 3 state this climb \"climbs the right side of the slab past several bolts 5.3\". Here is what I am nearly certain is a modern version of the correct route description:P1 - Start at an obvious tree-root and dirt ledge at the right side of the slab. Climb the slab and belay at a bolted anchor off to the left. 85-90 ft 5.2P2 - From the belay, move up and right about 20-30 ft to where a dike starts and rises back left. Make a move up and left gaining the dike. (\"crux\", the 1973 \"Joe Cote\" bolt in the dike was left in for historical purposes; you may prefer clipping the modern 3/8\" SS bolt to it's left.) Continue up the dike passing one more bolt ( 3/8\" SS just above the old 1973 bolt) on the right.  120 ft 5.4  to a double bolt anchor below the sandy/gravelly top. (\"old school\" 5.2-5.3)If you were to clip the first 1973 bolt coming from the bolted P1 belay anchor you will know why this climb was nearly certainly first climbed as a one-pitch climb without the P1 anchor. [ Think about the rope placement and how the leader would fall if the rope ran from the P1 belay to the 1973 bolt....the rope would \"flip\" a falling leader. Thus, I'm nearly positive the FA \"went\" as one long pitch from the ground. ]DESCENT: Rap or lower with one rope from the dbl bolt anchor, then a 2nd rap to the ground.P2 Variation: Climb directly up the \"headwall\" from the P1 anchor. 110 ft 5.4 - 5.5? -  R ","protection":"3 bolts on \"pitch 1\", 2 more bolts on \"pitch2\".Bolted anchor at the end of \"pitch 1\", double bolt anchor at top of P2.","location":"This is the first route you come to when hiking into the cliff.
