The main part of the wall is about 130 feet tall and identified by a couple of blocky chimneys that lead up to a tiered roof that cuts across the cliff at mid height. The left chimney line that gains a hand and off-width crack above the roofs is the Madara-Damp Route. The right one with a bolted anchor up high is a project in the process of being cleaned. Further to the right, reached by a little scramble, there are a couple old funky bolts to the right of a big hanging corner that are from an apparently abandoned project.. Just right of them is a crack with a new anchor that is getting cleaned out.   With a bunch more cleaning and death blocks removed, this will eventually be a good crag. If you decide to get on it in its current condition, wear your helmet and tread carefully.
