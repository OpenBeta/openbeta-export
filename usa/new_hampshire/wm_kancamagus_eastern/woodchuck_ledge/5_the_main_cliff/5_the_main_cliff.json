F.F.A. Brad. White ( not me) and friends, 1988. Climb up the central dike to reach the traverse ceiling moves left or west. There was a tremendous amount of loose rock in this section. I was leading it and the rocks had to be rid of first, before progress could be made. Ted was belaying at the large oak tree below the dike. When he was ready behind this tree. I pulled out the bottom rock and dozens more flew out, ricocheting all over the place, off of the high branches of the tree. After that event I was able do the (5-9) mantle onto the spike below the crux. I nailed the crack above the roof (A2) and traversed right or east onto the left diagonal upward sidewalk to belay. Ted led second pitch up sidewalk until it ends and then face climbed right directly up (5-6) to summit.    For decades people have wondered who did this climb? The wonderment is over now.  \n\n  There are three variations to second pitch. The easiest being (5-4) by going up the alcove corner above the sidewalk, the (5-8) directly up from the first pitch belay and the hardest (5-10d) keep moving left 10ft to a slanting crack and head up it to crux face climbing to the summit. The namesake of the route is in homage to Jimi Hendrix.","protection":"Trad rack.

There are some spots on this route that require carful movement due to loose rock. Also, it doesn't appear to get much traffic, so the lichen up at the cracks was...distracting...\n\n Normal rack, on the small side up to hands. Mostly finger sized. The crux isn't really protected for the second, so make sure they are confident at the grade and/or has some gear to ascend the rope in the event of a fall.\n\n P1: To the right of Deadline there is a blocky buttress. On the right side of the blocky buttress, about 30' to the right of the Deadline corner, there is a blocky chimney/notch. Climb up the chimney to the top of the buttress or a bit further to the base of the slab on the second pitch. There is a tree belay at both spots. 80'-100'. 5.7\n\n P2: Surmount the blocks to get to the base of the slab with a single bolt in it if you not already there. Make careful moves to a good stance for clipping the bolt (the moves to the bolt can be protected via a nut in the crack to the right; however, you may want to retrieve this piece after clipping the bolt). Traverse up and left (crux) past the bolt to a weakness in the overlap. Continue up and left following a series of cracks with terrific exposure. Gain the notch above. We set a belay anchor in the notch, but most parties probably belay from the top. 140'. 5.10c\n\n Decent: We rapped down from an existing rap station about 50' to climbers left of the top out using a 70m rope. That took us to a ledge that we down-climbed a bit to another rap station that brought us down over Sledgehammer. Doubles would have helped with the rap.","protection":"Standard rack to hands.
