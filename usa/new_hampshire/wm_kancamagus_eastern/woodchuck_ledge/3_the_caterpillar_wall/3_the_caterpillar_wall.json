Roger's Arete diagonals up the obvious arete on the right side of the pillar, passes a ledge, and continues up the lower-angle arete to the top of the spire.  Only the lower section is bolted, and a semi-detached block leans out from the steepest part of the lower arete.  Getting off that block felt awkward.  It is probably easier if you are tall. Handren reported 5 bolts; I remember only 3.  After the bolts and a ledge, easy climbing leads to the spire's upper face and arete (5.9).  There are shallow cracks on the face, but you may need to stem from the arete to the main wall in order to place pro in a vertical crack inside the chimney.  At the top of the pillar is a large block, possibly detached, slung with much tat.  Belay here or continue up Aspiring.","protection":"Bolts, small to medium gear, maybe RPs.
