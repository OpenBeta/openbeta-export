A fine hand crack in an overhanging corner. Nice rock. \n\nI'd like to add:\n\n  I don't know who these haters are that say NH doesn't have good crack climbs but they are sorely mistaken. That being said, Yes, this is probably the finest crack climb in NH.  \n\n  Expect perfect jams for most hand sizes all the way with the exception of a couple of Wide openings where you can choose your solution. It's the consistently steep pitch that will wear you down more than any particularly hard moves. There are a number of decent footholds out to the sides of the crack which give you a weapon to fight against the pump as you battle this beautiful beast. -Lee","protection":"Cams to 3\", a fixed rap/lower is in place. \n\nEdit: Particularly perfect for #1 and #2 camalots. I'd say 3 of each of those and you would be all set though I placed a #4 on the lower pod and I found it convenient. -Lee","location":"It is about in the middle of the crag. You can't miss it.
