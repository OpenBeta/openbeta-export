Landings for each boulder are flat and do not require many pads.\n\n Routes are re-discovered every day and it is advised to bring a wire brush to scrub some lichen if you see a line that is inspiring!\n\n We have reached out to local climbers about potential FA's in the past but currently have little information. Route names are temporary and please leave a comment if you have knowledge about existing names and first ascentionists. The bouldering potential here is endless and more people should come out and climb on these fantastic blocks!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.299Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:58.225Z"}
