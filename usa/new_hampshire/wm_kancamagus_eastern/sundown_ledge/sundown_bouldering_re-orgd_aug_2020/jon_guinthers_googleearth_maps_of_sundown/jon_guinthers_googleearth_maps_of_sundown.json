Many thanks to Jon Guinter who submitted these routes with photographs, and who gave permission for the routes to be re-organized.Original write-up by Jon:There are many boulders surrounding the main Sundown Ledge area. I spent a few days finding and cleaning some awesome problems, but there's a lot more potential! I gave everything my own names, but I'm sure some of these have been climbed before. Please comment and criticize my names/grades if you've climbed these before!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.298Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:29.015Z"}
