From there, make a very powerful right hand move to a good sloper knob, then work your way to the jug on the top of the face through a series of underclings and crimps. From there, I exit right by climbing Gettin' Bodied (v4-5). There is an alternate exit that climbs left and tops out on the face, but it's an extremely committing sloper mantle and I decided against it.The opening move is the crux, and felt on the upper end of v8 for me on it's own.
