This route gets the grade of 5.12c/d in the Handren guide, but after a crucial foothold broke low on the headwall, the crux became a body length longer - this extra body length is now probably hardest bit of climbing on the route - which is for the better!    Sustained crimping on small edges, sidepulls, underclings after a very \"traditional\" feeling boulder problem gains access to the route.   The rock may feel friable, but it has gotten a lot of traffic and no more holds have broken. There is a very large partially detached flake that the route finishes on, it hasn't moved yet, but it looks a little scary.   A great route to put together. 13a is my best guess for the grade, but would love to hear other opinions.","protection":"sport","location":"Alcohol Wall.
