I can't imagine climbing this in Boreal Fires. An overhanging laser cut corner with a very thin crack.

Very technical,strenuous stemming and micro seam laybacking leads to a stance at 3/4 height where hardship continues to a much easier and fun top out. The foot holds on this pitch are small to non-existent. If you want to TR, bring lots of webbing or cordalette to clear the lip from the tree, and throw in a directional, or you can rap in and build a bomber all gear anchor just below the lip with small cams and nuts.","protection":"The smallest gear you've got.
