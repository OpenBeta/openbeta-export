Over the years it has developed a somewhat notorious reputation as a mythical, hard-to-find cliff. With a GPS and and/or an advanced sense of cunning, The Outback Cliff isn't really that hard to find, and it's surprising close to the parking lot. \n\n  As of August 2012, the cliff looked like it had become reclaimed by the forest. But then again, almost every obscure cliff in New Hampshire tends to look like that in the depth of summer. There are a few worthwhile routes at the cliff, most notably Interzone, Love Crack, and Hyperspace. An inspiring photo George Hurley on Hyperspace appeared in a 1990's edition of Climbing magazine. Perhaps this photo contributed to Hyperspace's popularity, and prompted Jerry Handren, in his new guidebook, to refer to Hyperspace's \"oversold\" reputation. \n\n  The Outback Cliff seems to revel in contradictions: the routes are supposedly great, yet no one climbs them; the approach is short, yet everyone gets lost. I think the best beta is to go there and check it out for yourself...that is, if you can find it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:09.936Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:09.817Z","_change":{"user":"jhoZ1HM5QQCLlIW8x9mK3A==","historyId":"64b6bb0a6617e92410d92b45","operation":"orderArea","seq":2},"updatedBy":"jhoZ1HM5QQCLlIW8x9mK3A=="}
