This route contains the best that granite has to offer: tenuous finger jams, smeary feet, crisp edges, and a slopey top out.   \n\n  Locate the crack system in the middle of the cliff. That's it. Start in the right crack, make a transition into the left crack (a la Heather at Cathedral, but not nearly as hard). Jam and layback up this crack and figure out a cuxy sequence before a bomber jug and a bolt. Clip the bolt, move back left, and steel yourself for the heinous top out. There aren't really any holds at the lip, so stop looking for them.","protection":"This route is pretty well protected. There's probably a heady spot at the bottom, but the pro is pretty good.
