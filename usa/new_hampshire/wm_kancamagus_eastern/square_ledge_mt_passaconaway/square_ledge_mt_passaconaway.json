Access 3+ miles. 1.9 can be biked but what to do with bikes not a good idea like at the Captain. The ledge has several routes. Being within the Sandwhich Mt. Range Wilderness means no fixed gear. Mostly has upper half disconnecting cracks and minimal climbing features. Its very steep and smooth faced making it seem impenetrable almost everywhere. Adventure climbing at Square ledge has been published in Stewart Green's 'Climbing New England' of all places here it is to be found. This is the other Square Ledge and also named New Square Ledge. Much hidden here to offer success of finding a route that will summit unless you're Ray Rice. Thanks to Ray there is the 100 foot 'Race Crack' at 5.12 with multiple roofs and gear? Ray Rices routes are hearsay of long stretch between placements starting at 5.10. Finding 'Race Crack' likely will be challenging."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:09.932Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:22.045Z"}
