However a bit easier to get to than the Sherman Boulder. The boulder is a bit tall and requires a few pads. Worth the visit as it has some quality lines. If it was at either of the main areas it would see a lot of traffic.   After meandering around the park for many years it was awesome to stumble upon this, well in my eyes, gem. After quite a bit of scrubbing and flake exfoliation the rock is climbable and well textured. Obvious caution should be used as the boulder is fairly tall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.737Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:11.070Z"}
