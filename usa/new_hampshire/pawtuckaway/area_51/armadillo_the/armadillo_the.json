The first (need a name) and then The Armadillo. The Armadillo is down near the hemlocks, so is a bit of a chia boulder. About 6 or 7 years ago, Dave Quinn and I cleaned a lot on it and put up routes pretty much all around it, though a few good ones were left. Unfortunately, much of it has grown back and it is looking pretty green these days. It would be well worth a cleaning party to spend a few days brushing it up again, as it is full of good lines, from easy ones up the featured slab that you will see as you first approach, and a nice warm up crack to more heady ones on the back side and up the arete..grades from fun VB to maybe V4 or 5."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.757Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:11.588Z"}
