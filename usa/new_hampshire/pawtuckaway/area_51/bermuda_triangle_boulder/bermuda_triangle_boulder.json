My friend Rob and I got the arete from the sit up the triangle, the roof on the back side, and the crimpy face between the two routes (Not claiming FA just info). Great boulder. Around the other side of the boulder on the boulder leaning against it, there is a steep crumbly section that has a good line going from the bottom left up and right."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.756Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:59.647Z"}
