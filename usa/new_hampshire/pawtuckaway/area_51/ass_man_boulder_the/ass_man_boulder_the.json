On the north east side is an approximately 20 tall, gently over hanging face with a right to left angling finger crack. It has been done both as a sit down from the little roof and as a stand off the boulder. Around to the right of this face, coming out of a hole is a nice steep  moderate jughaul put up by Kasia Weglarz called Ass Man. \n\n  I have explored further NE from here. There are a few things, but fairly distant and scattered, nothing to warrant the walk with all the previous potential and the stuff towards Magic Pond."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.757Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:23.860Z"}
