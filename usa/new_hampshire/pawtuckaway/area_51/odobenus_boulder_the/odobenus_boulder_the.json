This is the last one of the line, about 400 feet to the NE of the Mowgli Boulder. It is aboute 20 feet tall. \n\n  I put up a handfull of lines here about 6 or 7 years ago, so they likely need recleaning. There is lots of potential for more good routes on it, some pretty hard and highball."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.755Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:23.832Z"}
