As the name implies, this catches the full morning sun and is a nice spot to have a quick safety breifing before heading in further. It is about a minute in and up on the slope a bit. It has an orangy, overhanging face looking south towards a marsh below. There is a nice angling traverse that starts as a sit down on the right, then tops out in the middle of the face where there is a crack. There is more lowball climbing on the overhanging back(uphill) side and in the slot between. I think I rated the traverse V2, but it may be a little harder.  \n\n  Up the hill and to the right a little is ledge with some potential, including a couple nice cracks. I don't remember what we did up there, so brush them up, have at them and get some FAs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.755Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:30.838Z"}
