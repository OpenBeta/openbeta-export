Execute the difficult (possibly crux) process of pulling on via slippery heelhook. Make a cool, precise move to an almost non-existent sloper. Get an awkward left heelhook and gun for a good left hand crimp. Match and control the swing before grabbing a sloping pinch on the arete. Scrunch your feet up and gun for the lip. throw a heel and top out. I'm on the shorter side, so I may have described more moves than necessary, but the problem is really fun and I highly encorouge you to get on it! \n\n  This can also be done as a stand start from the good crimp, which bumps it down to about v3, and is also quite worthwhile.","protection":"A few pads and a spotter, for sure.
