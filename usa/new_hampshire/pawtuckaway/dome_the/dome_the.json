I've been looking at it for years and just got around to cleaning it today. It climbs every bit as well as i thought it would. \n\n  It's a 20ft traverse to a top out but it makes upward progress with the slope of hill it's on so you are moving upward which feels nice. A steep wall with good feet (rare for Pway) and a mix of jugs and crimps with a sloper thrown in for spice.  \n\n  Start on the nice ledge jug down and right under the overhanging wall. Climb a couple moves in the crack to get established on a good 2 hand jug. head left on smaller holds leading to a cruxy traverse through crimps on the steep face. These crimps lead you to a huge jug at the lip where you can catch a shake before the top out. The top out isn't hard on it's own but it seems hard when you are tired. enjoy... \n\n  Full name: The Turkey Vulture Traverse (incase you were wondering)","protection":"pads, have someone move em along with you.","location":"from the base of the dome, walk around left following the trail toward the top.
