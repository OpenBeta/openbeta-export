Start with a sloping sharp right hand gaston seam and left hand to the left on a more horizontal seam.

This seems to be the more natural start, but is probably closer to V8 rather than V5.Falling from anywhere on the slab could have some consequences. While the slab isn't completely free of lichen, it is reasonably clean along the line of travel and all of the hand and footholds that you need are clean.If the start wasn't so awkward, this climb might be deserving of three stars.
