Even though we always have time to take another lap on one of the best problems in the park (or world) it can take a while to get curious about the other lines in the same area. \n\n  A pretty fun climb provided you have the requisite reach. The first move is rather large and might just be a show stopper if V6 is anywhere near your limit.   \n\n  After the big initial undercling move navigate a crimp or two, a cool sloper move then find your way to the top.  \n\n  Take care with pad placement cause the landing zone isn't perfect.","protection":"A few pads and a spotter are helpful as the landing zone is between a tree and a funky rock.","location":"20 feet to the left of overlooked there is a large tree.
