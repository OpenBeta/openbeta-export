Clip a high bolt and do a boulder problem. Then place some gear and do another boulder problem to easier climbing and belay at a crack or at the tree. \n\n  Pitch Two 13d: 100ft   Free climb Topless Tellers (A4). The corner looks easy but is ridiculously hard. At the top of the corner make a spooky exit move, clip a new bolt, then make a puzzling traverse/dyno left into Mines of Moria (A2). Launch into a hard and scary boulder problem with big fall potential (only clipping the good bolt). Finish with awesome and exposed climbing to the top.","protection":"Pitch one requires a couple of cams and a nut. For pitch two, you need a blue and orange TCU and maybe a nut or green alien for the top.","location":"Pitch one starts just left of the pendulum tree.
