While its neighboring route, The Mercy, holds the distinction of being the most chipped, glued, ugly route in New Hampshire, Sanctuary is strikingly different. The line is well-defined, all of the holds seem natural, and the climbing is athletic without being thuggish.  \n\n  Start by stick clipping the bolt. Slippery, heavily-chalked, slopers lead to the crux: a balancy lock off on a pretty bad crimp. From this point the holds become bigger, as wild campus moves lead to difficult climbing to get established with your feet above the lip. As on all great sport routes, a powerful and devious redpoint crux guards the chains.
