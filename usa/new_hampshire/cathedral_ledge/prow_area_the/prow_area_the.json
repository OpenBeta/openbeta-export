If you look at the perfectly sculpted arete, the Prow never veers farther than about 10 or 15 feet away from the edge. It is utterly classic, both as an aid climb and as a free climb. The pitches are mostly short and fierce. North Conway hardmen supposedly put in many days of hard work to free this in the 1970s. It's still considered a quite a challenge to climb it without falling.The first pitch has several variations, I think the standard way goes up a corner in a slab at about 5.9 or 5.10a. It is a great little pitch by itself, with a little smearing and a lot of laybacking.The second pitch goes at about 5.11c and makes use of a few bolts. Crank through a tough section that goes a bit past vertical, gain the crack, clip the pitons, and get after that slab. The latter part of the pitch is supposedly only about 5.10a, but it has frustratingly tiny hand and footholds.The third pitch goes to the right, around the arete, and up a very unique thin crack, again at about 5.10a. The crux comes when you awkwardly pull around the arete about midway up the pitch.The fourth pitch is exposed and wild! It gets hard right off the bat. The crux is really a boulder problem (5.11c/d). Climb straight up above to a seam, which turns into an awesome and strenuous finger crack that ends at the Space Station belay (a hanging belay from bomber bolts with feet on sloping ramp). A couple of pins exist within the crack still. A variation that's supposedly a bit easier technically climbs to the left off the belay and then rejoins the crack.The very steep fifth pitch is the crux. Make hard moves to the left from the belay, climb up thin cracks, and gain the dihedral. Stem carefully and economically up the airy, hanging corner until you get to the Triangle Roof. Now you can expend that energy you've been saving by boldly busting out that roof on the right. It's a real grunt - and a redpoint heartbreaker!If you've made it this far without falling, it's in the bag. The last pitch is gravy...dreamy 5.9 fingerlocks on a nicely featured slab seem downright easy after what you just went through.

Before stepping left onto the ledge belay, punch it it up and right on a long 5.10+ runout slab. You can place a bit of gear in a flake near the end. Pitch one ends at the bolt ladder of the Yellow Brick Road. This pitch is now dirty and needs to be cleaned again.Pitch two is fun, clean well protected 5.11 face climbing up the bolt ladder to a ledge.Â Pitch three traverses left across the wall to the \"space station\" belay on the Prow. Dicey 5.12- climbing up and left into a small corner where you can place some a small cam and perhaps a nut as well. Continue up and left on easier climbing past a bolt to gain the belay.

The difficulty is contained in this twenty foot stretch of crack. When the crack jogs upward and climbs directly up the wall, the holds become bigger and the climbing becomes less technical.To start, get yourself to the Space Station belay, the third belay on the Prow. You can climb up the Prow to reach this hanging stance. More likely, though, you can rap from the top of the cliff to a belay at the top of the LS crux pitch. Fix the rope here and rap again (still with the same rope) to the Space Station Belay.Climb up right off the belay, up the blunt arete that marks the very edge of the wall (5.12a). Two pins can be found at the start of the crack. You might chose to stick clip one or both of them. Once the crack is gained, engage in uber-technical climbing, using the angling crack for sidepulls, underclings, anything that makes your feet stick on the little nothings on the blank wall. The crux is moving from the last pin (which, by the way, is tied off because it sticks out about an inch. A tied off sling is usually in-situ) to the bolt at the end of the angling crack. From here, steep climbing (5.11+) with better gear leads to the two bolt belay stance.All of the gear on the angling crack is fixed.
