Intimidation is a full-length route up an intimidating wall and none of the pitches will let you down. This is one of the best multi-pitch 5.10s in NH. \n\n  The moderate climbing between the cruxes can be a bit run out, and though the hard parts can be scary, they are protected well enough (maybe PG13). The only real R rated climbing is the second pitch traverse and it goes at 5.8. \n\n  Pitch one: (5.10b) Start up the moderate ramp system heading toward the corner/crack. Sling two nuts together (I use #10 stoppers) and use them to reach a good high placement before making the moves in to the crack. Without this trick, the pitch is R rated for sure.   Continue up the corner and gain a well deserved rest and a bolt. The crux in my opinion is making a move left after the bolt using crimps to make a big reach and throwing a heelhook up to mantel. From here, climb moderately to the 2 bolt anchor. \n\n  Pitch 2: (5.8R) Climb up and clip a pin before making a hair-raising traverse left away from your gear. The climbing is slabby and gets harder as you move left until you get a thank god hold. You can then get a marginal placement to protect your second by climbing back above the traverse and placing a cam in a pocket...This gear is not great so don't bring a second that is not solid on 5.8 friction. \n\n  Pitch 3: (5.9+) Climb up above and to the right from the tree ledge gaining a thin crack with some tricky moves involving some face climbing.

To insure that the facts are recorded with some degree of accuracy, the story will be told in full. While cleaning the route on rappel in 1976, Ed Webster placed a bolt on the final slab, then was unable to even climb up to it. Everyone got a good chuckle out of this, but the best was yet to come.   Several years later, just for fun, Alain Comeau and several conspirators \"borrowed\" ten speed bicycle, rappelled down, and hung it off the offensive bolt, no doubt as a warning against any future ethical slippages! Paul Ross even went so far as to sneak Webster's camera along to photograph the event for posterity. But-as fate would have it- John Bragg @ Jay Wilson were climbing INTIMIDATION later that very same day. One can only imagine their incredulity upon noticing a ten speed bicylcle suspended out in the middle of a blank wall, and the subsequent argument over who saw it first! The bicycle was speedily rescued, albeit on a top-rope.   When the conspirators discovered the premature rescue of the bicycle, it was seized from Bragg and Wilson, and returned to its ignominious perch for the second time in the same day! There it remained for about two weeks until Webster finally rescued it-and alas, the poor bicycle was never quite the same again. On September 23, 1980, Ed Webster @ Susan Patenaude made the routes first ascent, but found an easier way around the famous bicycle bolt.\"\n\n P.1 Climb the first pitch of Intimidation, the left of two right facing dihederals.

For more info on the upper pitches please consult Webster's guide.  \n\n  Just right of Intimidation, climb an open corner (5.7). Exit onto a sloping ledge below an open right facing corner. Use a variety of techniques to get through the corner and finish with a fun mantle to a two bolt anchor w/rings. There are two pins in the right side of the corner and a bolt protecting the middle of the corner.","protection":"standard rack to #3 BD","location":"Directly right of Intimidation's first pitch"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,a28bb0ec-fafb-59b3-921a-fa7512cbd723,56bb8479-6e6c-535f-9d43-823ac7bfc99c","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","*Cathedral Ledge","Central Wall, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":2,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.6"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":2,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":12,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":3,"advanced":7,"expert":1}},"aid":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":3,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":3,"advanced":7,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.1663,44.064]},"bbox":[-71.16692577661908,44.063550339818136,-71.16567422338095,44.06444966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105926410","area_id":"VruEeW5sU1+dQ4I6x7/JnA=="},"content":{"description":"The Central Wall is a great area with full length climbs ranging from 5.10 to 5.12, some well over 400ft in length. Most routes climb corners and crack systems. \n\n  The classic in this area is Intimidation (5.10b), a killer climb that lives up to its name. The other \"classic\" is Repentance (5.10b R) which is a full-length chimney that is mossy wet and poorly protected in parts. I think it sounds fun. The wall from the bottom looks intimidating and hard to crack. Many climbs start up the first pitch of Intimidation and break off to become classic routes of their own. Even the sweetest climbs here don't see much traffic, so they can get a little dirty, but you can do your part by climbing them and that will help clean them off. \n\n  Climb to the top and walk off. You may also rap the cliff with double ropes from the anchor to the right of the finish of Intimidation (5.10b)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":12,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:10.302Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:29.292Z"}
