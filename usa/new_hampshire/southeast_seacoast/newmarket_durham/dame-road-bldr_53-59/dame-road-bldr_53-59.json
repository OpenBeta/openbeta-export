The interesting dome of high quality granite sits right on the shoulder of Dame Road in Durham. Joe Cote developed most of the climbing here sometime in the late 1960s or early 1970s. In the 1970s and 80s this was a popular practice and workout crag for local UNH climbers. It likely hasn't seen climber's using it for decades and is now quite overgrown. Dec 2021 Re-Organization - With the permission of \"nhclimber\" the sub-areas of this original posting have been deleted to avoid confusion and the photos that had been contained within them have been moved to (hopefully) the correct new sub-area \" Sweet Trail\" (and/or its sub-areas Sweet Trail North and South)As can be seen by the \"historic\" posted photo, Dame Road Boulder itself has a history of climbing, and we leave this posting for historic purposes. PLEASE DO NOT ADD SUB-AREAs to this Area, but it is PERFECTLY CORRECT to ADD ROUTES.
