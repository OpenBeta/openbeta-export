Parking is posted as maximum of 1 hour, but I don't know how regulated this is. During the fall and spring season you might have more luck than midsummer. Additionally, you are going to absolutely need to go on low tide or you won't be able to climb at all. Careful of the tidal pools, some spots are sketchier than others. If it's a sunny day you are going to be hot so prepare for that."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:18.356Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:26.187Z"}
