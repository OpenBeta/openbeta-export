The cliff is composed of pegmatitic granite and is about 100' at its tallest. It generally faces east and northeast making it a good afternoon destination in hot weather. There's also a great swimming hole along the access trail.\n\n ATTENTION: The cliff and the surrounding 241 acres was purchased in 2010 by the Trust for Public Land, Strafford Rivers Conservancy, New Hampshire Fish and Game, the Town of Barrington and other partners. The conservation of this land is the result of years of hard work. After decades of access issues this has been a gift to all who value this natural resource. Remember, this could just as easily have been a housing development. Please treat the area with respect and do your part to keep it clean. Pack out all of your trash.
