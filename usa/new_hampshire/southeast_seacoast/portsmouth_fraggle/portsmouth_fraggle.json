The rocks are all what I believe to be granite, but I'm not a geologist so I can't be too sure. The holds on each rock are all secure, though some are sharp and need to be held with a sure grip."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:18.357Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:55.669Z"}
