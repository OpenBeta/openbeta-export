Mostly toprope and some bouldering.   \n\n  Bring Lots of Webbing/Static rope as the solid trees for anchors are 15-30 ft away from the edge. \n\n  As of right now there are no named routes but it looks like there could be a dozen or so solid climbs from 5.6 to 5.11 as well as some boulder problems.  There's a real cool variety of rock, with neat textures and cool overhangs. Currently there is a lot of veggetation on the rock and some broken glass at the bottom soon to be cleaned up.
