If you get deep enough into the woods there is a large boulder with two splits in it to form three distinct pieces of rock. There are many possible slab routes here and the terrain is excellent for crash pads. The boulder is very secluded and honestly quite challenging to find but if you wander around long enough you will find it. Credit to Damian Regas for finding this one. The boulder is right on the edge of some private property so be careful if you choose to explore the area further. There are posted signs to mark no trespassing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:18.883Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:12.348Z"}
