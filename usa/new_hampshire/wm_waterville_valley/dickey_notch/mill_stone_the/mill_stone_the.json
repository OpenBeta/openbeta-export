The Mill Stone is a gray schist with white quartz banding. It was itself milled to its current state by glacial action. Polished, striated, and cracked, this little bedrock outcropping has a certain ascetic appeal.Covered by trees this area does not see direct sun for most of the year. A good place to climb when it is warm and dry.Here there are several nice crack climbs but as the area is remote and wooded without regular cleaning they will likely be covered in moss. Bring a brush! There is a two bolt anchor that service the routes here and it can be easily accessed by walking to the top of the crag if you would like to top rope, or scrub moss ;) "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:16.105Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:29.684Z"}
