My climbing is now inspired by my lost friend...Long and varied this route has got it all! Start with a boulder problem, don't worry use the tree. Then right on to some slabbing, followed by a section of technical face climbing leading to a cool hold then a ramp and nice rest. Above this a large layback flake leads to a chimney, fixed quickdraw, and awkward rest. Now you are ready to tackle the roof above you. Dont forget to hand jam and good luck! When pulling the roof the rope can stick in a small crack (not the one you are climbing) so it's good to look down and make sure it's free as you mantle up.
