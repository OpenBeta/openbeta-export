Oh and it can stay dry in a light rain!Make a couple of moves up and left past the first bolt situated on the left side of the slab wall. Make moves into the crack and follow this layback crack for about 40 ft. This climbing is fun and aesthetic but not too challenging.

Lifeblood is  technical, powerful and puzzling all in equal measure. It holds some of my favorite face climbing moves I’ve ever done. It was a great test of my route development skill set and it wasn’t so easy to climb once I had it equipped either. Please enjoy it. It is one of my favorite routes at Russell. The majority of the route climbs a stunning 15 degree overhanging orange wall. Some difficult (to figure out and to execute) moves between bolts 2 and 4 get you in the mode. There is a notch-ledge to the left about halfway through the steep climbing which offers either a good shake or a no hand rest depending on how you play it. I went with a full ledge rest on the FA so don’t be shy to milk it if you need it. After resting up move down and over to the right into an undercling and tackle the rest of the steep climbing. After an absolutely excellent sequence of moves it will become apparent that you need to move left to the arete… but where to do it?

The access, either rappelling in from Alchemy or ascending the dirt gully require skills that might not be in every sport climber's repertoire. Be careful out there and seek instruction if needed. When leaving The Nest, rappelling the fixed line is rerecommended. Also, as the Alchemy Wall sees more traffic there is a danger of items falling from above, down into The Nest.
