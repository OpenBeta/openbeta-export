If you are looking at Summer Wall, turn around and look slightly uphill. If you are at Livermore, just turn around. There it is. It offers a couple moderate longish climbs on very nice rock.I started developing this area in early April as a nice spot for the kids. The hang out at the base is friendly, and the climbs looked easy enough. I threw my rap rope down and started cleaning the rock. As with most low-angle rock in NH, it was covered in vegetation, so I got to work unearthing the climbs. A couple hours later, the rock was clean, I was dirty, and all the vegetation was lying at the base.Well, I started itching that night. Over the next few days, the itching exploded into a soul-crushing bout of poison ivy. My arms and legs were covered in it. I was miserable. It turns out that the vines I was ripping off the climb were poison ivy vines. It was warm enough that the oils were moving but early enough that the vines hadn't leafed out with their tell-tale leaves of three. A month earlier or later, I wouldn't have been in the situation. But those vines lit me up. I guess this serves me well for bolting moderate climbs for other people!The poison ivy is now gone from the climbs (you're welcome!), but watch for it at the base. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:21.385Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:15.087Z"}
