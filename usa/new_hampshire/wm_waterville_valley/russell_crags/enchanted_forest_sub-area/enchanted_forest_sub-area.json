Great climbing, a bit dirty, do it today if you like that old timey feel. Climb a nice corner to where it seems and slabs out. I believe there is still gear and at least a tree along the way to the shared belay on Enchanted Forest. The second pitch is bolted and beautiful.

The upper ridge is so super cool!Start by climbing inside an overhanging corner until you can exit left. Tricky crux moves lead back right and to the LONG arete. Moderate climbing for another hundred or so feet leads to a small run out on easer climbing to the anchor. You can lower off here with a 60m, just lower straight down the cliff and watch for climbers on other harder routes. If continuing on just clip a draw to the anchor and continue up really pleasant terrain and enjoy the incredible position on the knife ridge that finishes this long adventure. From the anchor you will rappel with one rope down into the gully at the top of the balcony and need to walk several hundred feet back down to your packs so plan accordingly. The first part is all new terrain that we cleaned. The second part was likely climbed by at least one previous party (piton) and recently retro-bolted.","protection":"I think it's like 16 or 18 bolts if you climb it as a single pitch and belay from the anchor above.
