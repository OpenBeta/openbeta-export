The same could be said of the two people who came together to make this route happen. Two very different organisms came together to make yet another enjoyable low angle face climb on this beautiful slab of rock. Start at the lowest point of the wall. Climb up clipping bolts one and two before stepping left into the cracked groove. The next few bolts can be climbs a couple of ways, straight up walking feet in the crack clipping bolts low to your right or with a hand on the crack, feet on the slab with bolts above you until a mantle opportunity presents itself.

To get started walk up hill a few steps from the base of the Trellis Tree (that's the wild crooked one on the right side of the base of the cliff) which is a good place to belay for this route. A steep but not so difficult start gets you on to more typical FG slab climbing. Pick your way through pretty chill terrain until you get to the final bulge. There are a couple of ways to surmount the steepest section but I really like traversing up and right with feet in the angling slab-crack until it is possible to get a foot onto the upper slab and mantle. Things are thinner up here but if you look around you will find a comfortable solution. There is a nice side-pull to the right from which you can clip the anchors. ","protection":"9 bolts to pigtails","location":"This is the far right bolt line on the wall currently.
