The first climb done here that we know of was done ground up by Mike Z and Nick B they left so little trace we didn't realize they had ever climbed here. This was a bold lead through fragile, vegetated rock and required a cool head and a fair bit of chutzpah. The climbs here are 5.10s and 5.11s as well as a nice lil 5.7 on the right.The far right end has a couple of mini cliffs.
