I think it has some of the best movement of the routes on Bald Knob. Somewhat unfortunately it is stuck behind the block in a narrow passage. I think that makes it kinda cool but it is a little contrived since you could totally stem off the wall behind you if you decided to. You also need an attentive belayer. The falls can all be done safely but not every belay is a solid belay (hint, don't keep a big loop of slack out on this one.... or anywhere that's not a clean overhanging pumpfest). Okay, enough with the set up. Walk around The Block and through a comfortable passage into \"the back room\". This line climbs the detached flake to a jug, traverses left on edges, moves up the arete and back right to the anchor. The last bolt is a little oddly placed but can be clipped easily if you find the position. Rock quality dictated its position. Expect a variety of movement and holds and expect to use your core muscles!","protection":"3 bolts to snchor.","location":"Walk around to the right side of the Block and through the doorway into the room between the Block and the main wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"c4u9JVePXhevFMWjdzcXqA==","name":"Astro Creep","yds":"5.10b","grades":{"yds":"5.10b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"Lee Hansche 2020","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.55405,43.90185]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"119536777","mp_crag_id":"119530625","climb_id":"c4u9JVePXhevFMWjdzcXqA==","areaRef":"cAV0IkaAVWeJRnJzjw7wQA=="},"content":{"description":"Starting in the wide crack on the far left move up to a good stance and make moves out to the right and up to a jug on the vertical face.
