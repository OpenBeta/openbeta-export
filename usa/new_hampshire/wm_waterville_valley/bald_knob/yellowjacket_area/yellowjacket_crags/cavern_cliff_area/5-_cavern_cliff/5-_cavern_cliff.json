The 20 foot off width section is the best and most difficult part of the route.  Getting into the off width is the first crux as it bulges out to give you blind footing.  Towards the top there is a good hand hold inside the crack.  Finish the off width and continue up the Low angle slab another 20 feet and  either cut left and hike off or mount another 4 foot wall and top out to hike off.","protection":"Mid sized stoppers and #3-#6 cams will give adequate protection.","location":"This is the most obvious line you will see the moment you arrive at the Upper Cliff.
