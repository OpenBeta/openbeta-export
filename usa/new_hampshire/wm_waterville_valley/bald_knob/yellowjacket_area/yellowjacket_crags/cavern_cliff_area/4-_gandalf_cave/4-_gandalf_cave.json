Smear your way up past the first 2 or 3 bolts more easily and then face a crimpy crux past the 4th bolt. Beyond that the wall steepens and the holds get bigger. What a cool and unlikely place to have a sweet slab climb. It would be possible in parts to stem across or chimney to the wall behind you but I like it best as a pure face/slab route. Do it however you see fit though, it's going to be fun either way and there is unlikely going to be anyone in the cave to judge you for your choices ;)","protection":"5 bolts to ring anchor.

To put up a climb that climbs one wall and then transfers to an opposing wall to finish the climb. Start on easy low angle rock past 3 bolts. Maybe 5.6. stem across the divide and clipped a fixed draw (I left a fixed draw in case you were short on reaching the bolt). It is a good idea to step back down and extend the last draw on the initial wall. Make the transfer to the other side. Climb up placing trad gear under the roof.
