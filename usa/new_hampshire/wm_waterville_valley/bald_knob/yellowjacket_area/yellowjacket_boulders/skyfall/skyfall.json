Start with your left hand on a low crimp and your right heel on a pretty obvious dish at the same level as your hand. Make a hard move with your right hand to a crisp edge, and then move your left hand to a slightly sloping hold (crux). Lock off, and follow jugs to topout. Starting higher significantly lessens the difficulty.","protection":"Multiple pads","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"LdEgeENyX4yL+dlSbdg4xA==","name":"Punch to the Face","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"Tim Armstrong 9/14/13","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.55647,43.90146]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108337361","mp_crag_id":"108332453","climb_id":"LdEgeENyX4yL+dlSbdg4xA==","areaRef":"bZwt5kJ0VV2Ek4R53aalkw=="},"content":{"description":"Start with a toe hook around the side with your right foot and a low smear with the left.
