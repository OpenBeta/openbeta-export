The mission was to pour over every inch of Dickie Ledge to find some gems that had been overlooked. I picked this line out easily when I noticed the steep wall perched above the more popular Dark Side. This route and it's brother were just what I was looking for. Near-vertical tech climbing with mixed gear and crimpy little cruxes perched in a magical location.\n\n This one is a few feet longer than Worlds Collide. Start in the crack just left of the short slab that leads up to the start of Worlds. Layback and jam your way up to the first hoizontal and place a piece (there is a large block that vibrates but doesn't seem like it's going anywhere. Still, don't place any gear against it.) The business starts here. Match on a good crimp rail down and right of the first bolt. Make your clip and embark on a dicey technical boulder problem. These were the hardest moves for me and the sequence ends with a full on toss to a slightly sloping edge in the second horizontal crack. Place another piece of gear... shake off... Clip a bolt... and make another improbable set of moves on tiny \"Dickie nubbins\" culminating in yet another, even more desperate toss for the slopy cliff top. I placed the anchor about 5 feet to the right where there is an actual jug to clip or better yet top-out and have a seat. Unfortunately the last move favors folks (like me) with a good reach. The tiny holds involved may be nice for a smaller climbers hands however so best thing to do is head up and give it a try.\n\n This thing will surely feel better on a crisp fall day than it did in the humidity I've been facing. Also both climbs on this face are much more reasonable with a few key hold ticked.

This route finishes spectacularly with one of my favorite views in the White Mountains. On top of that expect fun varied climbing on amazing granite from bottom to top!\n\n My vision for this line was to open up a safe climb at a moderate grade for folks getting in to trad climbing. So I did add some bolts where I would have just run it out personally. It is not however a sport route so expect some run out sections on 5.3-ish climbing. \n\nNotes added after hearing feedback: It has been brought to my attention by a few people that I had underestimated this climb when I first did it. I have upped the grade to 5.8 as I am happy to bend to the consensus and honestly don't like choosing grades in the first place. It has also been pointed out that without super solid rope handling there could be danger on the upper headwall of hitting the deck if you blew one of the tricky moves at the end. If you do feel like this could be an issue you could build an anchor closer to the headwall to make rope management easier. Perhaps the crack at the end of Say Nothing (5.5) would offer a good spot to reduce rope stretch. The very beginning flake requires care as well. Â place gear only where the flake meets the cliff and take your time placing even if it means you need to hang on it after. That's better than a ground fall. So my vision of a route for novices may not have been perfect but I am not willing to bolt a crack up on DIckie so I will say ALWAYS spend the time you need to place good gear, communicate with your belayer and only climb with people you trust to save your life. There are other routes at the grade and below now, so you could warm up on Say Nothing, Watching Me and or Watching You and the Dark Corridor.Â \n\n Pitch 1: The start moves and the finish move are the hardest parts for sure. Either stem off of the tree to gain the flake or (perhaps a little hard for 5.7) avoid the tree. Either way protect above the flake (the flake makes a good hold but I wouldn't trust it with a cam behind it in a fall). Mantle a nice ledge and then clip a couple of bolts while figuring out a tricky slab. After the tricky bit, romp up a very easy slab following a clean white streak and eventually gaining a belay at an oak tree (rappel set up on tree).\n\n Pitch 2: Step above the tree on to a couple of ledges. Move right to a big flake and use this to get up on top of the low angle slab above. Another cruiser slab (a little run out but 5.3) leads to two short slab headwalls with a ledge between. Surmount these slabs protected by bolts and gear and move up on a ledge to stand below the final sleep headwall. With a little finesse make your way in to the obvious crack with good pro. Be carful of one block that wouldn't be good to protect behind. Make your way through the path of least resistance until a perplexing final crux (place solid gear) makes you think twice (5.8). I used high feet and solid balance to lean out left for a thank god hold and a final mantle to the 2 bolt anchor.\n\n Enjoy the view while you bring up your second.\n\n 2 rappels with a 60m rope should get you down in style (throw knots in the ends just in case of course ;)","protection":"A normal rack up to #3 Camelot and some draws.","location":"There is a short wall on the left side of the Dark Side area.
