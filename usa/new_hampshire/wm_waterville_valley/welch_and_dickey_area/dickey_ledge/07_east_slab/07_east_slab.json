I had thought of usurping the old movie title \"Five Easy Pieces\" but chose to more clearly indicate this posting was a list of 5 climbs.These were all to the right of Flat Iron.  If you are into \"romping up 5.0 to 5.4 slab\" in \"adventure mode\", then stop reading here !  if you like a bit more Beta, read on. Climb # 1 - Start about 25+/- ft to the right of Flat Iron and climb up clean-ish rock between an \"inverted pine tree\" about 25 ft up (on the right), and bushes on the left.  P1 - about 90 ft to a 5-inch oak(?) tree with a rap/belay anchor.P2 Up shrubs, then left-ish and up thru a small overlap (some pro) and then straight up easy rock to a rap/belay anchor on a tree; which is about 40 ft up-and-right of the anchors of Flat Iron. 105 ft 5.3(?)  Disclaimer-  we only TR'd P2 of this climb, but did \"scope out\" \"P1\" on rappel, thus the \"?\".NOTE- I do not remember how much rope was left of our single 70m rope when we reached the 5-inch oak(?) tree from the anchor. Take care if using a 60m rope.   Plenty was left after rapping the lower pitch. Climb #2 - \"Gateway\" - This was the gateway to a nice, level tree&brush ledge and a clean, upper slab.Approach - Hike up and to the right about 75-100 ft from the start of Flat Iron.  (easiest terrain seemed to be about 10-20 ft out from the where the slab enters the woods) Cut back left to a flat-ish spot where there is a 5-inch white birch tree.  On the slab, a few feet from the tree is a triangular rock about 2 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft (photo 1).P1 - Step left to gain the clean rock, take this up to an overlap (gear) and climb over the overlap (a very height dependent move; alternately pass the OL on its left end). Continue up to the tree ledge (good belay here) then straight up the white rock [photo 2] (5.3 -5.4 R/X) to a tree clump with a rap/belay anchor.  About 215 ft done as one pitch, 5.3-5.4 R/X  Climbs 3,4 and 5 Start from the tree ledge Climb # 3 - From the tree ledge, we TR'd the steeper, grey-colored clean slab [photo 3 ] 10-15 ft right of \"Gateway\".  5.5  A thin crack about 40 ft up was cleaned out and a nut placed as a directional.Climb # 4 - From the tree ledge, we TR'd the steep, clean white rock about 5 ft left of the obvious corner / flake [photo 4] .  5.6  A #2 Camalot (gold) was placed behind a flake about 30 ft up as a directional.Climb # 5 - This climb was led before #4 was climbed.  Climb the corner, place pro and then make a \"tricky\" (for 5.5 or so ! )  step left and up. Above and left-ish, a gold #2 Camalot can be placed behind a horizontal flake, and further up and left the aforementioned wire nut in the thin crack. 5.4-5.5  100 ft  Rap from the fixed rap/belay station.NOTE- I do not remember how much rope was left of our single 70m rope when we reached the tree ledge from the anchor. Take care if using a 60m rope.   \n\n ","protection":"Very little available, but a std rack should do it  See individual climbs for protection beta.","location":"Climbs are to the right of Flat Iron - see individual climbs"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,4d307c6f-a172-5751-b91a-0dace8dcb147,69162ecd-fb3c-5c9f-9204-2164c60b35c9,7f671edb-5d0a-5f5d-be62-740287eab9fa,9e4126ce-81d4-5de9-abe2-46b5fcf3d7e7","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","WM: Waterville Valley","Welch and Dickey Area","Dickey Ledge","07.
