It is low ball and a bit awkward though I think I could make it less so with a few more ascents of it.  \n\n  Sit comfortably under a low roof and stick your arm deep in to the best hand jam in the world. Feet are very tricky so I ended up actually using a figure four kind of move. If you are super strong you might be able to just campus it. From here use some trickery to get to a killer jug and top it out. Climb a short slab and down climb easily.","protection":"Pad... spotter over a couple of funky rocks if you invert the way i did.","location":"Lowest point in the cluster of boulders.

Walk off easily. \n\n  My favorite part of this one was it's fun footwork. Small face holds and heel and toe hooks with interesting body position. \n\n  I would give this 4 stars personally if it weren't for one detail. The crimp rail is a little hollow and i needed to break it back a little before i thought it would be solid.
