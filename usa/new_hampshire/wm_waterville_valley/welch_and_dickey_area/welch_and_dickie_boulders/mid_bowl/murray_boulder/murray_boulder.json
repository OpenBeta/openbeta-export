Use a left foothold, and lever up to a bad(ish) crimp. Match the crimp (crux) and move left to a good hold. The topout looks easy, but you might be surprised by how tricky/awkward it is.  \n\n  I usually don't like the short problems, but Cheer Up Murray flows really well, and is a great addition to the growing Welch and Dickie circuit.","protection":"Pad","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,4d307c6f-a172-5751-b91a-0dace8dcb147,69162ecd-fb3c-5c9f-9204-2164c60b35c9,ffdd2233-e090-5647-b82a-646e7cbbe65a,25bedfea-eb18-5a66-ba34-dd3b13630417,b66ffbb6-e2da-52db-87bc-7d6d28e32765","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","WM: Waterville Valley","Welch and Dickey Area","Welch and Dickie Boulders","Mid Bowl","Murray Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.57541,43.9271]},"bbox":[-71.57603433460545,43.92665033981814,-71.57478566539456,43.927549660181874],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108617238","area_id":"tm/7tuLaUtuHvH1tKOMnZQ=="},"content":{"description":"The Murray Boulder is the kind that drives you crazy when you're wandering in the woods looking for boulder problems.

It just goes to show that you must walk around every rock when you're scoping for problems.
