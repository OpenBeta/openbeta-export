It follows a right to left rising traverse past an interesting schist roof. \n\n  Start standing in the pit with your right hand on a crimp and your left hand on an undercling. Climb up the face, passing a Cathedral-style face crux. Once you gain the roof, traverse left on underclings until you can achieve a tenuous rest. Work out the roof, heading left, past some slopers. Negotiate a tenuous and difficult topout onto the slab. Climb easier, but slightly highball, rock to the top.  \n\n  With about 20 moves, We Who Wander feels more like a sport climb than a boulder problem, but conveniently, you are never more than a few feet off the ground. The climb flows nicely and is varied enough to keep your interest as you wander your way across the rock.","protection":"Multiple pads","location":"The western face of the Wander Boulder."},"__v":0},{"_id":"YcJoeyHOVn2iGL02FqPUPg==","name":"Warmup Wall","yds":"V1-2","grades":{"yds":"V1-2","font":"5","vscale":"V1-2"},"fa":"Yan Mongrain, Jay Knower, Tim Armstrong","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.58532,43.91422]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"108482257","mp_crag_id":"108481760","climb_id":"YcJoeyHOVn2iGL02FqPUPg==","areaRef":"zpH7OXsoUW+ssGFeZgvfBQ=="},"content":{"description":"Around the corner to the right from We Who Wander is a steep, juggy face.

It climbs right side of the steep face on the north side of the Wander Boulder. Start with your hands on sidepulls above head height on the face itself. Do not reach around the corner with your right hand. The jug ledge around the corner is off both for your hand and your feet.
