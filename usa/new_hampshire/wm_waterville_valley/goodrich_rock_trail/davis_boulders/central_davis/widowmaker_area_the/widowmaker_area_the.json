This slab sticks out from the base of the boulder, so make sure to pad it correctly and be mindful of the edge when you do the first few moves of the problem.  Reach high to a good hold at the lip, pull onto the wall, and start traversing left. Traverse a few moves left, about to the center of the wall, and then figure out the topout.
