After the long face climb to the base of the 50ft. overlap sloping down on its north side is reached. Crux is getting onto the height of the overlap. From there on out its slightly easier as an outside corner face climb. Incredible ambiance being in the area of multiple slides to the west of this slide.","protection":"None but it'll take pro and that would be mainly angle pitons and maybe cams at the start to the overlap. I soloed it and kept the rope close at hand in case of an emergency.","location":"Can be seen from the tourist pullout parking spot to view Mount Osceola on the Kangmagus Highway to get your bearing to where the top of the slide is located. It's your usual 4 to 5000 footer bushwhack from the summit north to find the slide. A bit dangerous bushwhacking because it is hard see where the drop offs begin to where the forest ends."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,4d307c6f-a172-5751-b91a-0dace8dcb147,ca1c3b0d-2a73-57b1-8b7f-1a12eb70b640,966e70f3-5a1e-55c5-893e-6ebbdb772152","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","WM: Waterville Valley","Mount Osceola","Mount Osceola Summit"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.5852,43.918]},"bbox":[-71.58582423911383,43.917550339818135,-71.58457576088617,43.91844966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106829895","area_id":"lm5w81oeVcWJPm6723chUg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.58582423911383,43.917550339818135],[-71.58457576088617,43.917550339818135],[-71.58457576088617,43.91844966018187],[-71.58582423911383,43.91844966018187],[-71.58582423911383,43.917550339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"Rappel a whole rope length on the slides north side beginning down a large over laps outside corner face and then proceed nearly to the slide's base.
