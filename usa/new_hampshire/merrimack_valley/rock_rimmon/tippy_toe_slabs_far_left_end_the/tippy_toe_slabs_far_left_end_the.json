All variations are R rated on the lead but there are convenient TR anchors at the top... \n\n  My favorite way up the slabs is to start near the middle and climb easy chicken heads trending right tward a left leaning crack above... The chicken heads get smaller as you go... Gain the base of the crack and layback and jam your way to the top... \n\n  If you like real friction climbing start in the middle and head straight up to the top... There are fewer holds this way and you can test your rubber... \n\n  No matter what variation you are on if you spend some time here you will end up rescuing some unprepared novice or local punk who was suckerd in by the super easy climbing down low... \n\n  Map: mountainproject.com/v/new_h…","protection":"Not much pro at all though if you know the climb you could get a few pieces in...

The left end slabs are 80-100ft long with two eye-bolt anchors at the top, one on the right and one in the middle.... If you have the gear, there are options for building anchors from trees as well.... \n\n  It seems every day someone gets stuck on this inviting rock face in their sneakers and they either pull it together and climb up or down or they become a statistic by hurting themselves of getting rescued by climbers or the fire department...when I was 13, I had an epic experience in the middle of the slab with my dad where we climbed up lured in by the big comfortable chicken head features on the lower part of the cliff.... These features very slowly fade to smooth slab by the top and the cliff gets steeper.... This leaves the inexperienced soloist realizing how hard it is to downclimb a slab and how high they really are.... I was one of the ones who pulled it together and topped out...as did my heartrate.... \n\n  The climbing on the slab is moderate and a great place for beginners to get the basics down.... It is leadable, but it can be quite bold in parts as slabs don't afford much pro...."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:17.175Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:54.445Z"}
