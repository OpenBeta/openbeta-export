Not much developed yet but there are a few nice lines, mostly on the moderate side. I will post things as they develope, or if you head up there please post what problems you clean and send. There might be 15 or 20 lines total, not a big area but hey, its southern NH what do you want! \n\n  The rock is on the east side of Yacum hill off rt 114 in goffstown. Check it out on a map before heading out cause there is a little bush whack to be had."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:17.177Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:22.208Z"}
