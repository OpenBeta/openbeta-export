Sit start as for \"Final Fantasy\" and make a long reach out left to a good horizontal edge that can also be used as a sidepull. The feet are good and you have to rock over the left toe and lunge for it while staying close to the wall. I hit the edge with two fingers. After snagging the good hold, hold the tension and move your feet in order to match. From here move up to two good crimps. Set the feet and make a jump move to a good shelf protruding from the face. This shelf has a small tree growing on it. From the shelf match and head direct on good holds to a fun topout. It gets kind of high off the deck, but the landing is decent, especially by Clough standards.    A very fun variation to do while warming up on this great boulder.","protection":"2 or 3 pads and a spotter.
