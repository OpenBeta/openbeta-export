Pull onto the wall with slightly awkward feet and lunge for the lip. The lip is slopey and requires a great bit of tension in order to not grate off of the crystals. Match hands and top out. \n\n The easier beta requires starting with a high lefthand about a foot and a half higher than the seam used for the dyno.
