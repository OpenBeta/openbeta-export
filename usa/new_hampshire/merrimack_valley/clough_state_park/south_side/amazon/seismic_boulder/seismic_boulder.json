Squeeze hard and get some higher feet before figuring out how to snag one of the sharp crimps on the roof with the left-hand. After the left-hand move to the crimp, make another powerful right-hand move up the arete. From here, reach for the jug lip with either hand and core up to prevent the almost inevitable dab. \n\n A jump start from low under the roof with the pocket right-hand pinch to the lip jug has been done without dabbing the rock behind somehow.
