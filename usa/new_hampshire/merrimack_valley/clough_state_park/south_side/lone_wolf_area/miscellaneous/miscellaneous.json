Bump up to a really good hold on the arete, then make a big slap up the arete the an awesome hold that has a perfect little divot-oval cut out that fits 4 fingers. From here figure out how to get a slopey jug up high and work up and left and top at as for Lichen It.  \n\n  This climb is kinda morpho, as Brad couldn't span where I started, so people with shorter spans might have to just start matched on the arete, or higher up on the arete.
