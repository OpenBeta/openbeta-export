This climb is actually surprisingly fun once you suck it up about the landing and dabbiness. If you are six feet tall, good luck on this one.\n\n Sit start under the short roof on the right side of the boulder. a slider pad would most likely be best here. Reach over the lip with the right hand and find a right hand meathook seam. The left hand goes down low along the lip of the roof on an imaginary crystal pinch. Throw the left foot right under your left hand on the only obvious foothold. Once here, you are ready to pull hard in order to establish onto the wall.\n\n Pull on and smack up to some textured slopers then bump up again before coming in righty. A tricky friction dependent shouldery sequence and a campus foot swap on the sloping foothold eventually leads to an ez-pz outtro and topout.\n\n Fun to play on while the crew rages the rest of the boulder.","protection":"half pad and another pad for the outtro, potentially a helmet.
