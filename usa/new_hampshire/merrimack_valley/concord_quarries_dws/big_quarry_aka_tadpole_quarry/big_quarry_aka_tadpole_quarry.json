I have narrowly escaped getting in fights with drunk dudes (and a crazy chick) more than once. I could tell you stories, but I won't because I'm here to talk about climbing. So here is the deal: \n\n  Cliffs up to 40+ feet that host a handful of lines. The water isn't as clear as the little quarry but the cliffs are bigger and that's just cool. I put up a line up the highest part of the cliff about 10 years ago i later called it The Grim (hard to grade but I'd say 5.11) this is still my favorite climb there. There are a few others as well but i don't think any have names yet.  \n\n  Come here have some fun. Chill out on the county seat, a cool pile of rocks overlooking concord and the surrounding area. Just give the drunk locals some room and you will be fine."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:18.360Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:28.700Z"}
