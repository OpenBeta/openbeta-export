Clear water and slightly overhanging rock up to about 15 feet high makes this a cool place to experiment with a little beginner DWS. \n\n  There is a bit of a party scene here but its typically more mellow than the big quarry up the hill. My favorite lines here are on a 15 degree overhanging wall with sloping edges and a committing (but safe) top out. A great place to just chill out and relax on a nice summer day as well."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:18.358Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:26.280Z"}
