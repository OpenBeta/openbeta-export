Its a harry potter theme, deal with it, haha...This hidden micro crag is located in the back woods of Goffstown NH... The existing routes were put up by Lee Hansche and Jakob Montoya starting in the spring of 2007... Others may have climbed here in the past but there was no sign of any activity... Developement was done without any bolts and it should stay that way... There are great trees for setting up top ropes and most of the routes put up so far have been led either ground up or in a headpoint style using sometimes tricky, suspect or wide spread trad gear.... A few of the moderate routes host pretty good gear placements...    Lots of loose rock was cleaned from the steeper routes and what is left for loose stuff is pretty well stuck... You should however be careful yarding on anything thats not super solid...    We have been unable to figure out who owns the land the cliffs are on so care should be taken not to upset land owners and respect should be the rule when meeting people in these woods... I don't climb here too often but i would be bummed if the cliff was closed to climbing since its literally 1 mile from my house...
