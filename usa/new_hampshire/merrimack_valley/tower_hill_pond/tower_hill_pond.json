The pond feeds into Massabesic, Manchester’s source of drinking water so swimming or wading in the water is prohibited. The area is popular among local hikers, joggers, and dog walkers. It has several boulders hanging over the water. You can only climb these in the winter! The pond freezes nicely and typically the water level is dropped from Dec-March making it possible to set up a pad."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:16.107Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:25.742Z"}
