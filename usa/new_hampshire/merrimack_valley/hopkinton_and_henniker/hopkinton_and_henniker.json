Most of the boulders are hidden away on forest sanctuaries and power line areas, while some are on the side of the road. \n\n  People may question what you are doing with the pads on your back, and most likely you will be alone in the forest. For the most part this area offers secluded forested projecting and fun easy climbing, and can be climbed nearly all year.    The mosquitoes tend to get pretty bad in the shaded forest and ticks have begun to increase in the past few years as well. All sorts of wildlife can be seen while walking towards the bouldering lines. Some of the species include Ruffed Grouse, Whitetail Deer, Snowshoe Hare, Moose, Black Bear, Weasel, Raccoon, Skunk, Weasel, Raptors, Blue Herons, Canada Geese, Wood Ducks, Mallards, Owls, Fox as well as Bobcats. \n\n  This area also offers some great mountain bike trails as well as great hunting and fishing opportunities along with a maze of snowmobile trails.(Mountain Biking with crash-pads?)"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:17.173Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:09.956Z"}
