Looked easier then it was, which is why I am adding it. It is truly a one move wonder, if you can manage to get established at all. \n\n Start with right hand on a small side-pull crimp and left hand where ever you want, step up to get onto the awkward start stance. Once you are established, make a dead-point move to a good jug towards the top of the arete. It takes a good bit of core tension to hold the jug. This actually ended up being a lot more fun that I thought too.","protection":"pads","location":"to the right of the arete on the blank face"},"__v":0},{"_id":"l8pGNVWdUSGO44XC0i9hIQ==","name":"Norb","yds":"V1","grades":{"yds":"V1","font":"5","vscale":"V1"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.6216,42.7333]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"115176293","mp_crag_id":"115176283","climb_id":"l8pGNVWdUSGO44XC0i9hIQ==","areaRef":"ZNKjRaMIVgS6MlbmWuLrLw=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start with both hands matched on the large jug rail.
