It stands about 12 feet tall and holds a handful of problems. There are two problems that prove to be a challenge and make it a worth-while destination. Other problems are V-Easy and serve as a good warm-up. There is an easy down-climb off of the back-side that makes this a good place for beginners. \n\n Maybe I shouldn't have said \"secluded\", as there is another boulder in close proximity. However, the other boulder only has a few v-easy problems making for more good practice/warm-ups."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:18.362Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:29.326Z"}
