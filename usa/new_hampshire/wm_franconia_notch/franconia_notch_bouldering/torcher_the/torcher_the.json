It will shred your skin and possibly break your spirit, but you’ll be grinning ear to ear every time you try it.\n\n Start in the back of the crack with your feet on a pedestal and your hands in some sinker jams. Climb the thinning crack to it's terminus and make hard technical moves to the arete. Somewhat tricky sloper slapping and compression takes you to the top of the boulder. Take note of the crimp hard to see on the left face. The top out is straight forward on good holds, but it not something you would want to pop off of.","protection":"As many pads as you can find.

From there you can step off the ramp rock into the toe hook and climb the boulder to the top. It's a great option to climb if you intend to project the route over a long period of time, or if the crack is wet, because the sequence is essentially the same as if you started from the crack. It's a good route on it's own, even if it does skip the best part.
