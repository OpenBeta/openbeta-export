If it's your first time at this crag, you'll probably look up at this route and say \"5.8?? AND good pro??\"  This route is rather steep and exposed, but with good protection that you cannot always see from below.  Take special care with route finding, as there is some loose rock.    From the anchor, climb up and left to the first of two bolts on the face.  After the second bolt, climb fairly directly up the face (some route finding necessary) past a pin, and the final two bolts towards the top of the climb.   There is no real \"crux,\" just consistent 5.8 face climbing.  The route ends at the top of The Flatiron, on a huge ledge with a two bolt anchor and commanding views of the notch.","protection":"4 Bolts and a pin help keep you on route, with small gear in between (i.e. small aliens and stoppers).  Your won't need anything bigger than a .75 camalot.","location":"From the gully below the cliff, scramble up 4th class terrain to the right, on top of the exposed outcrop (you may want to short pitch this section if your second isn't totally solid).  Look for a single bolt next to a crack (perfect for a #2 camelot), this is your anchor and the true start of the climb."},"__v":0},{"_id":"y17IbYYfVT6ih8T53+QCpw==","name":"Puckered Pork","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.6789,44.1704]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"107567120","mp_crag_id":"106587648","climb_id":"y17IbYYfVT6ih8T53+QCpw==","areaRef":"w/6WsE3lUsOAUJ1Y3GgPBg=="},"content":{"description":"This route, like its sister routes to the right, is steep and exposed, but with good (read safe as well) protection.  From the approach gully, climb the face below a lone bolt at an overlap. Protect as desired below the overlap, then reach out on good holds and clip the bolt.  Take special care to plan well to avoid rope drag. Its best to clip this bolt with a two foot sling. If you dont plan well (as I didnt) the face above will be more like solid 5.10 than 5.9+. Surmount the overlap by stepping left and then back right. Clip a pin then ascend to the base of the main face. Protect the move onto the face with a mid-sized TCU and step out! Great face climbing with a few thinner crux areas.  Follow the bolts to the top and a two bolt anchor.
