Dirty and wet on the east side. Beautiful views and some excellent rock climbing. John Sykes, Secrets of the Notch has route descriptions but, I didn't post anything I did there after I started climbing it in 1982. Ed webster's guide book of 1986 also includes Indian Head. I prefer Ed's guide for details on Indian Head. This cliff has no sport routes and demanding traditional climbing because then difficulty to protect leading. Sometimes climbing without gear for the ascent. There remains little visiting to climb the face. No traffic noise from interstate 93.    We found an old bolt and pin on this cliff.     At the lower summit, southeast is a block with two (5.10) finger cracks that are excellent, 30-40ft. in height and excellent for gear. I don't remember how to get down from the block's top.    The cliff has it prow (namesake) that is the longest section to climb. West of that are several off width cracks and further down through uprooted woods is a broken rock section of cliff 50ft high to reach the summit."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:09.494Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:27.899Z"}
