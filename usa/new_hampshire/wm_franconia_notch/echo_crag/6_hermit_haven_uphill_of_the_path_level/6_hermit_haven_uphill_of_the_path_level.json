Head up and right on horizontal cracks (placeing gear) aiming for the top of the \"scoop\". A funky mantal will put you on a great stance and clip a bolt. Make hard moves past two more bolts (crux) to the two bolt anchor. All bolts where put in on lead on aid. Also the bottom of this can be quite wet. If so send it to the ledge barefoot, put your shoues on and go for the send... don't be scared!\n\n The name comes from Matt Hickey bushwhacking from Thornton NH to echo to help put up the route just because he wanted the walk.","protection":"Gear to BD #2, three bolts, two bolt anchor with rapell rings.","location":"Loacted on the Far right side of hermit haven.
