Even with the addition of bolts some people will want a few pieces of small gear to protect the run out at the top of many of these routes especially as seepage can add a serious pucker factor to otherwise easy ground. The crag is several hundred feet long and maybe 90 feet tall at its max, much of the left side is vertical and the right side a bit slabby with an overlap guarding its top. You can lower sport style from the routes I've been on then rap from some pretty sweet homemade anchors, no joke they really are sweet, to clean the routes."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:09.499Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:27.699Z"}
