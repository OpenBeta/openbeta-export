Although not especially large this crag is home to a small selection of amazing climbs on steep extremely unique pocketed granite unlike anything else in Northern NH. The gully itself is small and can be prone to loose rock due to water runoff in the spring so use caution especially in early season when hiking above others. However there is a great ledge just outside of the gully proper that can comfortably handle a few  people making this area far more pleasant for small groups than you might expect. The top of this cliff is also one of the few places you can fully see Cannon cliff, Profile lake and Echo lake from the same stance making it a must visit in the fall.\n\n ***This is a new crag thus lurks the occasional friable hold and a bit of grit compared to Rumney***"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:09.497Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:20.974Z"}
