Grab the kind of poor crimps to start, find a little bump on the wall for a foot and move right to a good rail. Get matched on the rail, set your feet on a couple of smears and go up to the sloping ledge. There is a sweet spot in the back you may have to feel around for. Bring your right hand up to a hornlike feature created by the end of the sloping edge and make a deadpoint move to the lip. The mantle is pretty easy but scary, make sure its clean first.Â ","protection":"A few pads and a spotter should be enough, completely flat landing.","location":"Take the old logging road till you get to the \"Entrance Boulder\".

From there go out left to arete. From there, this is uncleaned. There are probably two ways to proceed, one being to pull yourself around the arete and top out a slopey ramp. The other would be to keep working your left hand up the arete and then getting your feet high enough to deadpoint/dyno to the lip with your right. Then mantle the lip to top out. Both variations need a bit of cleaning. My guess is the first variation is around V4 and maybe the second V5/6, although it really depends on how good the arete feels once cleaned.","protection":"A couple of pads and a spotter, its high but has a nice flat landing.","location":"On the Entrance Boulder, same start as Flight."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,22ef85e3-1165-545d-a6db-ce2238b66f85,3c837f4c-e35a-50d8-9f89-6630bdc433b9,cb378d4e-db5f-5215-b6c2-c0563c71db9d,3b791331-8207-5a05-af38-257093b397ed","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","WM: Albany Area","Band M (Re-opened)","Band M Bouldering","Entrance Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3-4"},{"count":1,"label":"V4-5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.16815,43.95059]},"bbox":[-71.16877458130767,43.950140339818134,-71.16752541869229,43.951039660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114356831","area_id":"O3kTMYIHWgWvOCVwk7OX7Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.16877458130767,43.950140339818134],[-71.16752541869229,43.950140339818134],[-71.16752541869229,43.951039660181856],[-71.16877458130767,43.951039660181856],[-71.16877458130767,43.950140339818134]]]}},"content":{"description":"The closest boulder to the trail and totally obvious as you approach it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:19.679Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:36.290Z"}
