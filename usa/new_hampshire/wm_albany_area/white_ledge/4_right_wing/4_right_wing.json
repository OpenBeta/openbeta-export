Also, we rapped down this pitch with a single “70m” measured at 72 meters and had only about a meter on each end left at the mid-tree ledge. So a single 60m won’t make it, although you could probably swing left to the maple tree on White Boys and do a short rap from that. RHall NH Admin. ] P3: Step up right to a large ledge. Climb straight up the broken slab with a few gear options to a large pine tree anchor on top. 5.5 60ft (?!)
