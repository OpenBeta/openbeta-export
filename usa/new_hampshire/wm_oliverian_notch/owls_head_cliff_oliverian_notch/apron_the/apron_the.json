It was a top rope climb. It got bolted late 80's. It was a top rope I couldn't get through the crux section. I couldn't get through the mid section without being paranoid in 2002. The bolts were deteriorated. I moved right into a right facing corner (5-9) and climbed it instead, midway on the climb. I got in some decent stoppers (1 got fixed by accident). It's a decent corner. After the corner I moved left, back onto this route and escaped higher up onto the Beak Buttress.","protection":"Widely spaced bolts approximately 15ft apart.
