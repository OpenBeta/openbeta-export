Crash pads needed. There are two large granite boulders here. Clearly used to be one larger boulder that split into two. Pretty shady, lots of potential for routes. Standing start on the left side, move around the corner and continue up. Top out is dirty and likely needs to be cleaned every time you go. Pretty easy warmup climb, not a destination, more of a fun thing to do while hiking on the trail.
