The bridge is made up of thousands of quality granite blocks perfectly positioned without mortar.  The original purpose of this structure was to span the Branch River and expand the Cheshire Railroad.  Now it is just a historically relic with the bonus of a few good climbing routes.  Routes are almost always top roped from mason bolts but trad is possible.  The bridge is only about 45 tall but most of the routes are sustained face climbs with few rests.  The best climbs are on the north west side, the first section on the right as you approach.  There is plenty of sun here and it is somewhat sheltered from the wind.  If you climb other sections look out for poison ivy.  Although close to the road this spot is usually quiet with only the sound of the river peacefully flowing by."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:17.773Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:49.289Z"}
