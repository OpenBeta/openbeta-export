Sit start with left hand on a triangle side pull and right hand on a crimp on the face to the right. Feet are low on some edges. Find the right body position and fire up right hand to an awful mono pocket. I can only fit 3/4 pad of my middle finger  in the pocket then I crimp on the edge with the other fingers. Lock off and find feet. Move up and left to a decent side pull then hit the lip and make a hard mantel to top out. Full value for such a short problem.","protection":"Perfect landing.
