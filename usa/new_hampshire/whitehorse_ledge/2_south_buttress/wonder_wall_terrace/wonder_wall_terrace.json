Â This spacious ledge is a great place to hang out in the early season as all these routes dry out very fast, and the place catches a lot of sun. in the very early or very late season I recommend hauling a bag of warm layers and food up there, and making a day of it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:11.673Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:35:21.230Z"}
