The best part is that little brushing is required to put up new lines!Routes can be added on an individual basis, but once more get established sub-areas may have to be employed to efficiently organize this large talus field."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:11.669Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:27.455Z"}
