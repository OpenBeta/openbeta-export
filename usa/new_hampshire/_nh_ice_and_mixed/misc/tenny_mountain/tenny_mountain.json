The mountain is frequented by back country skiers both around the residential areas and up across the mountain with skins and/or tele/AT gear.  Unfortunately due to neglect of grooming the trails in the summer, there is currently a lot of brush and overgrowth in the ski trails which without a 2 to 4 foot base of snow, there can be much trouble to move around and through the overgrowth.  A few short ice and mixed climbing routes are hidden in a crag just south of the south-most ski trail and about half way up the mountain."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:08.952Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:19:55.475Z"}
