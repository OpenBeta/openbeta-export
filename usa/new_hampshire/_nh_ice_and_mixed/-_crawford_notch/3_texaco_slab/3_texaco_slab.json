Pull off at a point across from the 3rd house on the right-hand side (East) side of the road between Davis Path and the Private Campground (Which used to be a Texaco Gas Station, hence the name.)\n\n There's a few different lines, especially in \"thick ice\" years, but I don't know if they have ever been given names."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.082Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:06.285Z"}
