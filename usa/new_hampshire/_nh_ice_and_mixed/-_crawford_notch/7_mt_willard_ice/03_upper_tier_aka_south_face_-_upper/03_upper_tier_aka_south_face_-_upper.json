Willard is clearly visible from Rt. 302 as one drives up Crawford Notch. This often results in dangerously erratic driving by certain members of our community as they take their eyes off the road to check out conditions.  Please pull over to gawk. \n\n  Most of the routes are in the lower tier but one can climb to the summit and hike out on the Mt. Willard Trail (1.6 miles, 40 mins.).  Cauliflower Gully is the most common route to the top."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.085Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:51.880Z"}
