Additional info. can be had there.  R Hall Admin.\n\n 140ft of N.E.W.Ice - It's a wide one and two parties could climb it at same time: one party on the left wall that is thinner than the actual waterfall ice to climb, W.I.4+. Another party will have plenty of room to choose how to make it up the central water fall also. It's probably all together 50 yards wide. Trees are plentiful to belay at the top of the falls from. great W.I.3+ Fat ice all the ways up the falls. How many screws is up to you. Plenty of views of the falls on the internet in the winter and the rest of the year. Popular with hikers and climbers and there's lots images on the internet."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.082Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:06.269Z"}
