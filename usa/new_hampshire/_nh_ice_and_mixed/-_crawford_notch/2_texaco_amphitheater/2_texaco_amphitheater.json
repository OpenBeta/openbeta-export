Generally not as crowded as Frankenstein. The Slab area is really moderate and the Amphitheater has a variety of moderate to hard climbs. The nice thing about the Amphitheater is that it is sunny and generally sheltered from the wind.  Several hundred yards up the hill from the amphitheater is another great section of WI2-3 flows."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.082Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:05.986Z"}
