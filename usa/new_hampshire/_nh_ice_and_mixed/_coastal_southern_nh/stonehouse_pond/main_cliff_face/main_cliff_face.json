There is the obvious nose of the face with a giant dihedral/gully to the right and blocky slabs to the left. Summit approach and decent is best from climbers left.  \n\n  On the far left hand side of the crag is a short but very steep section of cliff tapering from 70ft to 10ft as you progress up hill. There are some interesting potential M-Hard routes on this face. As winter progresses I'll post photos of this area. \n\n  The center of the crag there in the obvious gully somewhat similar to \"Goofer's Delight\" in North Conway. Similar but the ice flow angles up and left instead of right like on Goofers. This is the only named flow (The Flywalk, NEI-3) at the crag to my knowledge. There are bolted rap rings far to the right of this climb where in really good seasons the ice might reach the ground. This far right line is a bolted sport route during the summer months. \n\n  On the very far right hand side of the crag somewhat separated from the Main Cliff Face is another small ice ramp. Instead of descending from the top of the main cliff off left, go right. Hike through the woods paralleling the pond, cross over a deep washout and head slightly uphill. It is about a 5 minute walk from the height-of-land. This slab is used by UNH and other groups for top roping with novice ice climbers. 20-30 ft tall and as wide."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.207Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:55.993Z"}
