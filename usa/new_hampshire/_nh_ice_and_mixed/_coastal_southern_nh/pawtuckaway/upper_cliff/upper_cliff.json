Ice thick enough to climb seems to form in the back of the Great Chimney, on the slab between the rock climbs Bishop and Yellow Zonkers, and along the left crack of the rock climb Double Jam. There are also some smaller flows scattered along the shorter cliff bands down past the rock climb Far Out Jam. Overall not a destination but makes for a nice afternoon under the right conditions. Might be best to avoid crampons and tools on existing rock routes if there isn't enough ice to climb without leaving drytool marks."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.208Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:54.161Z"}
