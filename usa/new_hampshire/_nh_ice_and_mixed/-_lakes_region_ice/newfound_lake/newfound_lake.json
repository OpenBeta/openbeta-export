Actually all the climbs that regularly form are really nice , then there are some obscure mixed or less reliable routes that are worth doing if they are in, but not classics... Crowds can sometimes an issue on weekends but midweek its a nice secret stash... The biggest challenge is the parking situation which is often changing... The roads are narrow so parking on the sides of the road is out... There was a small parking area a little north of the cliff that was recently developed by the owner of the property... Word on the street is that the owners of the lot are cool with you parking as long as you ask... If anyone has more info on parking please post... \n\n  There are Two popular routes both of which hold a few variations between grade 3 and 4... There is also a nice grade 5 curtain when it is in good shape... Routes are all 1 or 2 pitches and finish in the woods... Double 60m ropes will get you down from all routes... You can also walk off to the left (south) but its much easier to rap... \n\n  The best part of the crag is that you don't have to drive far for fat consistent ice... Rumney is great but it gets too much sun to be reliable... Being east facing, Newfound only gets the cold early morning light and there for it forms well..."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.083Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:51.829Z"}
