Not just among climbers either, it's up there with Cape Cod and Lake Winnipesaukee. For many, climbing and or skiing Tuckerman Ravine is a rite of passage. This glacial ravine offers ice in the early season and moderate to steep snow in mid-winter to spring. While it may not stack up well with Huntington Ravine as a mountaineering location alone, it makes up for it with endless opportunities for steep skiing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.635Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:36:51.412Z"}
