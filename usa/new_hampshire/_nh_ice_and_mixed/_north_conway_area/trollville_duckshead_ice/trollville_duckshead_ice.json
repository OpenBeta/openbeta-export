Trollville has great moderate to desperate ice routes, a high concentration of hard classic mixed climbs and a few rock climbs. A short approach would seemingly make it popular but the hard climbs and a HUGE 2002 rockfall that destroyed the classic testpiece Manchurian, have kept people away.\"Before there was ice, there was rock\".   The rock climbing is described in the Trollville/Duckshead AREA under \"Bartlett/Jackson\"  R Hall NH Admin.
