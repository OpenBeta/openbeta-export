Below it is the low angled gully. The dike and the adjacent right east wall are ice routes. There is the dry tool and hand climbing for thirty plus feet of rock to approach the gully. The gully drains the water away before the rock bottom. The climbing is as special to anywhere in New Hampshire in the narrow twisting Wendell's Dike. The iced wall right is very exposed and must come in some winters. I have not seen anywhere more to ice climb in Wonderland. Highest east wall below the Crow's Nest Trail does get a thirty foot plus ramp to a short head wall of ice bulged curtains. There is a totally devoid of snow, seat and walkway under an overhang at the start to the rock wall approach pitch. That's nice."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.641Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:51.336Z"}
