There are however many worthwhile short flows to the right of the rock climbs that can be fun if you aren't scoring your ice climbs by length. To some it might look like ice bouldering, to others a convenient training ground.  Slabs, pillars, curtains, a touch of mixed (not on established rock routes of course). There might be a little something for everyone. Little being the operative word. the longest ice routes are about 35 feet tall."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.080Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:06.172Z"}
