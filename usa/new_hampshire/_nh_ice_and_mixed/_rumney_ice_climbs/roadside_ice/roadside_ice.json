One or two that are substantial, climbing up the roadcut cliff. Another more bouldery to the left of the cut.  \n\n  One thing to keep in mind here is traffic. It would be a bad idea to knock ice down into the roadway where a car might run afoul of it. Climb with care and at your own risk."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.642Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:58.910Z"}
