This route packs a fun punch for its size even feeling almost alpine in the right conditions and is great training in awkward easy mixed. (Even got a heel toe cam in crampons :)    If anybody knows the actual grade, FA info, etc please let me know. Just thought this route was fun enough to post here especially since for me personally it was a bit of a different experience to the surrounding routes.","protection":"A couple ice screws (10cm-13cm) and depending on the ice you can get a .5 behind a flake on the left at the end of the crux and a #1 just before the exit if the top is dry.","location":"This is the obvious short chimney just right of Shaelyn's Way."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,c93a995d-1814-5b5c-b978-1b4deedad543,b6774a46-6718-5408-9319-1a689c5ed5fd,dac3369e-170c-5914-b734-6edebc5c99f6","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","* NH Ice and Mixed","* Rumney Ice Climbs","Parking Lot Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.3"}],"byDiscipline":{"ice":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.83462,43.80192]},"bbox":[-71.83524302495344,43.80147033981815,-71.83399697504655,43.80236966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105914933","area_id":"2sM2nhcMWRS3NG7evFyZ9g=="},"content":{"description":"This is a very popular area for beginners to top rope on a variety of ice flows; however, there are some harder lines and good leading opportunities as well.... \n\n  The Parking Lot Wall rock climbing area is just up the hill from the parking lot (hence the name).

In the winter, there are a good selection of fun ice climbing here including the popular, Franky Lee (WI4+), and Centerfold (WI3)...the Parking Lot Wall is far more vast in the winter than the rock climbing area, it extends far to the right to a huge slab that creates a top roping paradise of slabs bulges and pillars.... The routes here are unnamed for the most part, and you can feel free to choose your own adventure.... \n\n  This is just the beginning, pull in to the main parking area, and you will see that there is no lack of ice in this, the easiest to approach of Rumney crags...have fun...."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.643Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:51.694Z"}
