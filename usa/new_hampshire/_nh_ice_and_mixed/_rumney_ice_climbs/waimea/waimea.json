One is that there is a very rare full ice climb that touches down some winters just to the right of the rock climb Waimea 5.10d. If it is in and the ice seems decent, get after it! I've only seen it in on days that I have been rock climbing but I want it bad. \n\n  Another important point is that though some tempting ice can form on sections of cliff we ask that no one takes crampon of ice tool to the rock at Waimea. Like most cliffs at Rumney, the rock is riddled with established rock climbs. The schist is soft stone. Metal on stone could be Very damaging to these established climbs. Thank you for understanding.  \n\n  The right end and at least one obscure out-of-the way climb come in sometime so keep it on your radar."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.641Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:05.928Z"}
