The far left side has most steepest ice and some climbs will need trad gear. The far right has bulging with steep height ice and some ceiling dry point neighboring ice potential. Think environmentally friendly first to the exposed moss ledges, please. The ice is thick enough and it has height from this year's drought, possibly?    These climbs are short workouts and have problematic moves, although only one has been recorded done, it is not for me too say any of these have not been done before."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.081Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:05.806Z"}
