The cliffs and boulders on this hillside have been touched by climbers over the years here and there. Most are drawn to the beautiful ice pillar that is plainly visible from the road in the winter.  \n\n  The access to this area right now stands as CLOSED TO CLIMBING OF ANY KIND . The reason for this closure is due to insurance policies, they are not unreasonable grumpy people who hate climbers. Please cooperate with the land owners and do not climb there against their wishes. Through cooperation we keep open the possibility of one day gaining access to what would be an amazing addition to the Rumney area climbing scene.   \n\n  Please do not add routes to this area as it would only encourage people to break the rules stated above."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.642Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:06.036Z"}
