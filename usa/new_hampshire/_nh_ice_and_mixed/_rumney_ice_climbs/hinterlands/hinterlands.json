There are a handful of other beautiful climbs to the right of Geographic as well.... Climbing here starts at grade 4 and goes up.... So, if you want steep ice in Rumney this is the place to be.... \n\n  The routes are long by Rumney standards at 80 to 100ft.... The guide book recommends rapping from the top with 2 ropes, but a 60m MIGHT stretch back to the ground.... I prefer to rap the gully to the right, there is a fixed rope but it might be iced in.... \n\n  The climbing is found in the alcove that is known for the impressive rock climb Giant Man (5.12 b/c).... Just to the left of this steep obvious climb is Geographic Factor with the rest of the ice to the right of that....   The alcove keeps the ice blocked from the sun for much of the day so routes tend to be consistent...."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.079Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:04.711Z"}
