Some of the most notable run on either side of Yellowknife buttress. The gully on the left goes up to Summit Cliff. The one on the right accesses some of the Yellowknife rock climbs and eventually the Monolith, a seldom explored rock feature. Between the rock routes and the Monolith, under certain conditions some big ice flows can form on the left side of the gully.Â "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.635Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:59.856Z"}
