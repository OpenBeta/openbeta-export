When they are in you should jump right on them and ask questions later... most of the time they might look possable but detached or a candled mess so make educated decisions before jumping on a route that could come down on your head... \n\n  Reasons to be Cheerful is usually desperate and goes at 5+ but ive seen it in fat and looking more like straight up grade 5... The descriptions in the current ice guide to new england for other routes in this area are so poor i dont know what to call them but if you know the routes please post them so we can know what we are climbing... \n\n  The bottom line is... when there is fat ice spend a day here..."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.642Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:05.987Z"}
