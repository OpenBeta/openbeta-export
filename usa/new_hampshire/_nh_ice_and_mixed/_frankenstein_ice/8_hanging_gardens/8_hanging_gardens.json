When this area is in it rules... A really warm day could ruin it so if you see the climb you want, get after it while its there...  \n\n  The climbing here ranges from WI4+ to WI6... All of the routes are short and steep... Recommendations are Clawcicle (4+/5), Scratching Post (4+), Without Reason(5+)... There is also a steep M8 for those who like the hard steep dry tooling... \n\n  This is a great and convenient place to drop a top rope just please let the routes come in well before top roping them as this is a sensitive place as far as forming ice is concerned..."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.636Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:05.506Z"}
