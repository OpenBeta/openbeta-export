Adams - King Ravine\"\n\n  King Ravine is a good sized glacial cirque gouged out of the Northern slopes of Mt. Adams, several miles up the Presidential Range from Mt. Washington. Though not as impressive as Huntington or other ravines in the area, King Ravine does have a few snow and ice gullies that make it worth a visit. Being relatively lightly trafficked in winter and a good distance from the road, this is a place that will require self-sufficiency from any climbing group as well as good avalanche skills. There was a slide a few years ago that caught a pair of climbers off guard and could have easily resulted in a fatality, so be aware. A report of the incident can be found here: avalanche-center.org/Incideâ€¦\n\n  The climbs you find here may turn out to be snowless rock scrambles, easy snow gullies, or moderate to difficult ice depending on the conditions. Descend via the Airline, Valley Way, or Spur Trail."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.206Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:03:53.746Z"}
