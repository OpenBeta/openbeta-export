The cliff is south facing offering plenty of sun but which also makes for very soft ice during the warmer temperatures.   \n\n  The mountain offers a number of alpine ice and mixed routes some yet to be climbed.  If you decide to climb here, you are almost guaranteed the mountain for yourself as most climbers would not like to bother with the wilderness approach.  For those who do not mind a winter bushwhack (or who are lucky enough to climb there after a trail has been blazed), the mountain offers excellent alpine ice and mountaineering."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.208Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:36:48.724Z"}
