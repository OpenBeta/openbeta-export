They extend southeast from the bridge, towards the Boulder Loop Trail. \n\n  Rock quality is mostly good and friction-y, like climbing on sandpaper, sometimes covered with a thin layer of fine green lichen or some of the larger, leafy lichen. \n\n  The area can get crowded with bicyclists and tourists checking out the covered bridge, especially on weekends during the summer. \n\n  Sometimes, you see ice-climbers back along the wall during the winter."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.210Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:36:45.601Z"}
