He did one of the three lines in 1978, with Doug C. Burnell. I don't know how he found it? There was a herd of deer below this area when I climbed two lines up. W.I2+ and a easy W.I.3. They are wide frozen cascades and open at the top with a good view north. North facing area and that can mean very cold. They are way back in the woods 2 or 3 miles. Easy to find though, if you're into this kind of winter bushwhacking to climb, this place is perfecto for remote solitude multiple pitch novice climbing. Make a fire and hang out or camp over night. Its nice woods. Snowshoes recommended."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:14.206Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:05.104Z"}
