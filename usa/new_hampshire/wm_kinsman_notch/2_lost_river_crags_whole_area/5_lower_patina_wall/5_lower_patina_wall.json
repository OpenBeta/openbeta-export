Pitch 1 and 3 are very fun, but P2 is a little bit dirty, but worth it for pitch 3. This route was found in Jon Sykes book The Notches (which I recommend you get because it has a lot more detail, pictures and adventures in it), and I think it is a fun route which needs a little bit of love to clean it up and make it classic.\n\n P1 (5.7+): Climb up \"past 2 right-facing flakes, then past a bolt\", go up and to your left into an alcove with a tree (it wouldn't be New England without some tree action), climb out of the alcove and follow a crack with some beautiful patina up and to the right, face climb to a \"right-facing corner\" and finish at a 2-bolt belay. Spectacular, has a little bit of a Red Rocks, NV feel to it.\n\n P2 (5.6 PG-13?): [According to Rob Albert P2 and P3 are inaccessible] From the P1 belay go up and left through the trees to get you to a slab. Go up the run out slab and traverse left at a logical point and climb up to a 2 bolt-anchor. This pitch is a bit a bit dirty, and a little bit run out.\n\n P3 (5.7): Climb up the to the arching corner system, clipping a bolt (spooky). Continue up the slab past 3 more bolts to a golden left-facing dihedral (if the corner crack were a little cleaner this would be as good as P1). Belay at a 2-bolt anchor.\n\n Descent: Rap with 2 60m ropes to the base of Russian Arena OR according to Sykes \"Rappel with one 60-meter rope down into the Russian Arena in 2 rappels\"","protection":"Standard Rack\n\n 1 Bolt on the first pitch, 3-4 bolts on the last pitch\n\n All 3 belays are bolted","location":"On Lower Patina wall to the left of Patina, starts a few feet left of the boulder."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,c9b1c641-fcee-508f-bb8b-c6d63ff4b7d5,cb4337d1-a144-577f-8f77-4e413d0f234b,244d2985-c766-5f7c-bac6-2b912b36afa1","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","WM: Kinsman Notch","2.

It also appears (to me) most bolts have been replaced...at least they all looked new to me on Lower Patina Wall in Sept 2019.\n\n Home to at least a dozen climbs, including the \"gem\" Black Tourmaline (5.7+, 300 ft) the Lower Patina Wall is destined to become one of the \"destination\" crags at Kinsman. (OK, bad pun)\n\n The area gets its name from the patina of chip-like flakes, similar to the veneer on some of the faces at Red Rocks.\n\n NOTE: There is a new (2019) 8-bolt route between Black Tourmaline and Patina that is not even in the Sykes guidebook, don't get it confused with either climb!  There is also a little-climbed climb between Patina and \"PowerHead\" that climbs up thru the green moss-lichen.  This is SykoHead (5.7 R / X?)  More info in the guidebook (and see photo).
