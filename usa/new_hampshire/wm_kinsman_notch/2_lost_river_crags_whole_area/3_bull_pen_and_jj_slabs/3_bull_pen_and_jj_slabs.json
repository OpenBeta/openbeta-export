It also appears (to me) most bolts have been replaced...at least they all looked new to me on Lower Patina Wall in Sept 2019.\n\n The JJ Slab is a few minutes beyond the Bull Pen and has two routes, 5.5 and 5.6 although when we were there they were quite damp."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:21.383Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:53.854Z"}
