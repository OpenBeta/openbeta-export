Very unique as far as granite goes. Only thing keeping this from being 4 stars is the length, if your in the area it would be a shame not to get on this. Crux is in-between first and third bolt. There are some other cool looking sport climbs in the area, if you wanna learn more about them buy The Notches by Jon Sykes as it documents Kinsman notch very well. ","protection":"4 bolts to a two bolt anchor","location":"As you approach lower patina wall take a left that goes steeply up hill, or rap in from the top of black tourmaline's 2nd pitch.
