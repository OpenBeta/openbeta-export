It also appears (to me) most bolts have been replaced...at least they all looked new to me on Lower Patina Wall in Sept 2019.\n\n Home to at least nine routes, 5.6 to 5.9, with one 5.10c/d, this short little cliff (50-80 ft) should start to see more use once the guide is published."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:21.383Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:37:54.369Z"}
