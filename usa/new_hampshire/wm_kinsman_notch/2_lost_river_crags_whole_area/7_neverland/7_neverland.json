You may encounter charred trees and BEWARE OF NYLON RAP ANCHORS ON TREES and BOLTS. The prudent will replace!.\n\n Update 2019 -   Since the fire this entire area has seen extensive clean up and trail work by Jamie Cunningham and local climbers and most routes are climbable including all three pitches of Black Tourmaline.  The crags are all open now and expect to find lots of new growth ferns and small shrubs along the trail as nature takes care of the fire damage.  Jamie recommends folks bring in loppers (or hand clippers) and a small saw for any further trail and route maintenance. It also appears (to me) most bolts have been replaced...at least they all looked new to me on Lower Patina Wall in Sept 2019.\n\n The newest edition to the Lost River Crags. The farthest walk in from the lot, but we are in it for adventure aren't we? Neverland hosts seven routes at this time, and more to come. Mostly a bolt protected area but most routes require a bit of gear as well. All routes are bolted ground up on lead. This is very close if not partly on Lost River reservation property so keep a low profile."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":7,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:21.382Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:14.866Z"}
