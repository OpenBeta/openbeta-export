It also appears (to me) most bolts have been replaced...at least they all looked new to me on Lower Patina Wall in Sept 2019.\n\n A nice selection of cracks. About 7 routes from 5.6 to 5.12a, most 5.6 to 5.9\n\nNOTE: Lose Blocks - As of 9/28/19 There are some very loose toaster oven/microwave sized loose stones to the left of the Troll/Gargoyle anchors. Take care not to dislodge them with your feet while belaying or rapping as It wouldn't take much to knock them loose on those at the cliff base."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:21.384Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:04:45.460Z"}
