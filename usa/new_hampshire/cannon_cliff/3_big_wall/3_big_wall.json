Hard friction off the anchor (5.11), or right then up (5.10R). Continue past face traversing left to shallow dihedral and slabs w/a small overlap. 5.11P6. Climb through blocky headwall, moving right then up a shallow lt-facing corner to slabs.

It’s 5.7R , and wet most of the time. Going straight up from pitch 5 final headwall ( or traversing right low early in pitch 6 ) may be better. New guidebook describes it as an option.   The good news is that pitch 5 seemed much cleaner, I think some loose rock came down with the obelisk.P7.

Jim Shimberg and I finish this pitch on a cloudy wet day. Reached a corner left above my rappel gear (higher in corner old lost arrow pin). This was the way the mystery climber went. I did a tension traverse to the corner I wanted too climb directly above the rappel gear.    Nailed Three pins and we took turns drilling out the hole for a bolt at the corner's end. Up there lastly, burned out, misjudged the depth of the hole we had made, and put in a shallow okay bolt.

Back down again and into the how on earth does this exist extremely broken up wall of stacked flakes, like granite broken egg shell pieces. Granite flakes stronger than they look and easy climbing not gear protective. Thirty feet up and right from the bolt is the bolted belay ledge and the mysterious climber's (2 1/4\" bolts)and gear. We added a third bolt to the rappel station ledge below the large crescent moon arches of the last pitch. We stopped and rappelled.   Removed the block from the best way up from the dike.

Jim and I returned in October to place bolt above rappel belay station to access the highest arches above the belay.

It is a very direct, natural line with some really classic climbing. The rock quality and protection is a bit lacking in places, particularly the Ghost Roof pitch. If you have done the other big wall classics, this route should definitely be on your list.  \n\n  P1. Start by climbing the first long, scrappy pitch shared by the Ghost, VMC Direct and a couple others. 200' 5.7 \n\n  P2. Free climb the obvious right leaning crack to a stance. Continue along the weakness to where the bolt ladder starts. Nest some gear and make a face move or two left into a nice, moderate corner to a belay. Classic, 100' 10+ \n\n  P3. Now on Heirophant Tower, climb straight up off the belay into the first, obvious arch feature to a bolt. Clip one more bolt and make some very thin (crux) moves to access the next arch/scoop feature. Awesome climbing leads to the base of a corner and, higher, rejoins The Ghost. Step left out of the corner and boldly climb the face above to a roof. A boulder problem deposits you at the anchor atop of one of Cannon's coolest features, The Great Flake. Again, classic, 100' 5.12 or 5.10 A0 \n\n  P4. Step right and make face moves past thin gear. Ramble your way through fun, interesting rock to a great ledge almost directly above your belayer. 100' 9+? \n\n  P5. The Ghost Roof. Flavor Country. Follow a line of weakness up towards the obvious corner through the roofs. This pitch gets an A4 rating not because of difficult aid placements but because of the possibility of your gear dislodging circus animal sized blocks. Free climbing this terrain feels equally, if not more, serious. If the rock turns out to be good, this pitch is PG rated. I would rather not test it. Once is enough 80' 5.11? R \n\n  P6-7. Pick your way to the top among slabs, bushes and choss. ~300-400' \n\n  All belays consist of bolts with rap rings, the route can be rappelled from anywhere. Two ropes are only needed to get down from the first pitch so if rapping, it might make sense to leave the second cord at the first anchor. All other pitches can be rapped with one rope. A fact that is unique among the Cannon big wall routes is that this route only has 3 protection bolts. \n\n  At present, the history of the free climbing on this route is a bit foggy. Jim Shimberg, Doug Madara and Chris Dube did some climbing in this area but don't remember what they did or did not free. The grades are my own guesses from a free ascent Ryan Brooks and I made in September 2014. Conditions were less than ideal that day and several pitches, especially the Ghost Roof, were quite wet. It would be interesting to hear thoughts on grades from subsequent (or past??) ascents.","protection":"Single rack to 3 camalot.

It has a complex history with some sections first climbed in the 70s and others in the 90s. Jon Sykes's guidebook (Secrets of the Notch, 1st ed., 2001) describes the route and history quite well. Here I paraphrase his descriptions of pitches 5-11, because I have only done the first four, which are far and away the most popular. You'll find that the climbing on the first four is as good as on VMCDD or Lab Wall, making these some of Cannon's very best pitches. Sykes's book is a great resource, but unfortunately it's out of print. You might be able to find a copy at EMS or IME. \n\n  The route starts about 100' right of Labyrinth Wall Direct and 100' left of YMC Dike at a nice belay ledge on top of a 50' buttress. Locate a large roof about 100' off the deck - it's the roof that the first pitch of Lab Wall skirts the left edge of. If you are standing directly underneath the right edge of this roof, the start of Benedictus is up the jumbly buttress to your right. (Underneath the right side of this roof is a line of bolts belonging to the Lowther Memorial route. Benedictus is 20' further right.) \n\n  1. Climb off the ledge up and right to a hollow flake, continue to a very shallow left-facing corner, and clip a bolt. Layback up the corner past a pin; the short crux is about 5.11a if you're tall, a little harder if you're not. Step left to climb flakes and edges, 5.8 R, to a large ledge and a bolt anchor. 75' \n\n  2. The sick-looking finger crack splitting the clean face directly above you is your target. Climb up and slightly right through a bulge at maybe 5.9 and continue to the base of the finger crack. Layback, fingerlock, and crimp your way up this classic stretch of rock, clocking in at low-end 5.11. Gear belay at a stance underneath the roof, or link into pitch 3. 100' \n\n  3. Follow the roof leftward as it angles upward and turns into a chimney in a corner. Chimney or layback, whatever you do it's about 5.9. When the corner ends move right to a nice stance with a bolted belay. 40' \n\n  4. Climb up and slightly right to gain a left-trending ramp. Climb the ramp up to a shallow right-facing corner/flake feature. Clip a bolt and climb through a short crux, 5.11a with the right sequence. Belay at the nice ledge atop the flake. 75' \n\n  You can rappel from here with  a single 70m rope. From this point Benedictus Direct goes straight up the face on bolts, then climbs the overlap with two hook moves. The face goes free at 5.11d/5.12a to underneath the overlap, then the Insult to Injury variation (5.12a/b) traverses right. Another free variation goes left from the belay atop the pitch 4 flake and is described below. I can't comment on the state of the bolts or pins or how necky the R-rated sections are. \n\n  5. Climb up and left following a seam at 5.9R. Reach a stance, clip a bolt, continue left past a second bolt and a first crux at 5.11c. Join up with Lab Wall's fifth pitch, climb the 5.11 headwall to a small ledge and a two-bolt belay shared with Lab Wall. 100' \n\n  6. From this belay, Lab Wall goes up and left and When I Paint My Masterpiece goes right. Climb up and right to a horizontal crack, continue right past two pins at 5.10b. Climb through the overlap on large holds at 5.9+ R, and up the face to a two bolt belay at the next overlap. 120' \n\n  7. Traverse left then climb up to a crack below the overlap. Step right, clip a bolt, and undercling over the overlap past a second bolt, 5.11b. Move right to a stance and clip a third bolt, then climb the slab up and left past a fourth bolt at 5.9 R to join Walk on the Wild Side. Finish the pitch with a rightward 5.10 R traverse to a bolted belay at the grassy ledge. 100' \n\n  8. Instead of moving right to YMC Dike as you would for WOTWS, climb straight up the face at 5.9 R to a bolt, then step left at 5.10d to gain a right-leaning arch. Lab Wall Direct joins here. Climb the arch at 5.9 to a two-bolt belay. 80' \n\n  9. Climb left past a dowel, continue left at 5.9 and then turn up and right. Lab Wall Direct goes left here. Climb straight up the face, clipping three bolts, until you reach the shrubs.
