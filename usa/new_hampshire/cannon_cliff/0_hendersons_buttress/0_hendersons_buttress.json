Its ends on up in the garden before onto the large slightly sloping platform split into two halves by the hand wide crack for belay. We called it the brain.    Pitch 3 goes up the obvious giant left facing corner. The physical crux is about 15ft up this corner with a technical jam lay back maneuver. After the crux a precarious loosely wedged oven size block avoided. Stopped above it and brought everyone up and with little effort (cool trundle) sent it off. I moved the belay over to the right and began leading up the opposite side of the buttress in a fun large right facing corner. I went only 40 ft up to very nice unprotected extremely difficult stemming. I retreated and moved the belay to go up the large corner.  I led up the wonderfully unique chock stone filled corner crack (5-5) to belay at fixed pins. Its was getting late To the right were old slings tied off to some questionable rocks and adjacent right the ancient 8 ft high, 20 ft long, 6\" wide wafer of granite. We called it the pinkie.    4th pitch I led up and over it. What an adrenaline rush and the protection is a sling on the horn. Not good.

On the 4th pitch (5-5) head right and up to climb face beneath 'Muir Wall' (5-7) hand crack. After that belay. Used to proceed up and right to tree ledge beneath the final wall up and off of the cliff. Used to top off left of the Whitney Gilman Ridge. Last pitch and some of fourth pitch are gone. Fourth is doable but very dangerously run out. Last pitch is nowhere to be found in plain sight. We traversed to W.G.R. in 2000 to get off the climb. It used to be a decent climb and done several times.
