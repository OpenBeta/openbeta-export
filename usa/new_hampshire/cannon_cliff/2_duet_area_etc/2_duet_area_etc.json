Followed up right moderately (5-5) to break between arches then up break to arch and then a long easy (5-0) walk to the right. Here I belayed Craig down from the walkway about twenty feet into a nice depression on the slab. Next I led through the moderate (5-5) break in this arch and made moves left to the base of an excellent central corner crack system. This system I went up to a small inclining wall that is much easier than it looks (5-5) but the exposure is high and gear is inadequate. Often protection is a mixed bag of good and bad or who knows what will happen when fallen onto these placements. Whatever I didnt find out and I dont want to know when a crazy long run out begins after such protection. It doesn't really matter because of the run out, it's easy (5-2) on solid rock to a great belay. Craig arrived and we made a big cairn on the rock garden wide ledge against the cliff to rid ourselves of the danger of sending a rock down on us during rappel or retrieval of the rope after rappel. It looked like we were making a hiking trail. It is a route Id highly recommend to climb but probably it wont be done because of where it is.    2003-The third pitch to Shady Grove was started with hit the deck (5-6) face moves up left and then across right intimidating walk like an Egyptian 10ft up to a (5-8) short strenuous finger crack (pin) that I led. After that I went left over a very exposed outside cornered void gingerly not touching the large loose block poised there to go off the cliff. Then a highly exposed easy (5-2) ramp slab face was climbed to a stooped platform ledge system that stopped me beneath a corner of the blackened rock head wall. I put in a bolt ending the attempted pitch. This wall is definitely free climbable. Needs 2 more bolts. Thats as far on this climb as we have gotten. I belayed Craig up and he nudged the block off the cliff.    Then I lowered Craig and the #1 stoppers I had put in to belay him up with blew out of the crack because of our combined weight of force was too much onto them. Oops, but we were also belayed on the bolt. We both dropped several feet into air from this occurrence onto that bolt. I lowered Craig down on our one point of protection and rappelled myself out of there. Craig hasnt returned to Cannon Cliff since then with me, and he pretty much quit climbing crags a few months later.    I would like to finish the climb up this blackened head wall and there will be a ramp to traverse left across to the gully like path of Fafnirs Ice flow to a belay below the large buttress between this flow and the Black Dike. From there on, excellent rock to climb up and off the cliff. A rappel anchor below the summit would be much easier than crashing bushwhacking through the stunted pine trees to the W.G.R. trail. It is a route I would highly recommend to become finished but it probably wont be, because will anyone else besides me, firstly go where this climb is? At least you all know it's potential exist now. Holds are similar to the W.G.R.

Bill Hardigan belayed me as the first pitch began up the central crack that splits the Duet Slab in half. The climb enters the slab from the left and then proceeds directly up the crack. I was applying a lot of torque onto the rope from my protection so I placed a large piton at this height (just in case the torque pulled my gear out if I fell). Mid way up the climb near the end of the crack (crux) I fell ripping all the gear out above and below the pin. The torque in the rope pulled every piece of gear out of the cliff except the piton. I came to a stop in the bushes at the base of the cliff and I put my feet on the ground. Time for some thought and afterthought opposition wires to get past where I fell and another piton. That worked. I climbed ahead to do a tension traverse right (A0) into the strenuous arch difficult (5-10+) shallow corner arching lay back. After that I belayed Andy Crane up to the right end side of Duet Buttress's large ceiling.    Dave Karl freed the first pitch later on that summer with Ted Hammond and I.   Joel OConnell climbed most of the route with me. Joel and I did the 'Wrong Crack' 2nd pitch to get to Sextet's new third pitch. A superb (5-8) hand crack, the furthest left crack of 3 cracks from a shared belay station of other climbs. Crack ends at the next large ledge also shared as a belay for other climbs. Moving right and up is the connector pitch with its nuisance bushes at first, then the hard severe (5-8) ramp onto the wall between Duet Buttress and Icarus midway corner. The climbing becomes moderately easy (5-5) up this wall traversing up to a excellent belay with large medium cams, hexes in a crack. The fifth pitch went moderate (5-5) diagonally up traversing with no protection until gained is a series of steep little protected cornered slab ramps (Icarus) climbed to an excellent belay ledge (5-4). Joel and I stopped and rappelled from here.      I returned with Andy Byerly to include a second pitch for Sextet with an extreme difficulty (5-11b A0) crack climb on the wall to the right. Cool two slab cracks. 200ft of slab cracks at least. I led and nailed the crack 100ft+ free climbing it. I had to hoist myself up with aid (A-0) on the crack after a rest ledge. Fingers aren't small enough for the crack. This is the the same crack as 'Wrong Crack' from here moved to Wrong Crack's belay Station. After that we climbed Sextet to where Joel and I had stopped before. I led on up the corner to a giant house size block was climbed under and over to a belay. After that I led the 6th pitch right and up diagonally moderate (5-5) poorly protected to the bottom of the fifth pitch of 'Sams Swan Song'. Then I led up and left of Sam's at (5-7) variation and we finished up Sam's.    A Large Rock slide happened that winter and removed the house size block and smashed up Sextet and the Icarus Route. This altered the fifth and sixth pitches. Anders Kressy and I went up Sextet in 1986. I led through the debris field and Anders cleared the (some car sized) rocks. Now the fifth pitch ends to the right. A new start to the sixth pitch is a newly available corner to the unprotected face (5-5)from the original climb that ends up on Sam's.
