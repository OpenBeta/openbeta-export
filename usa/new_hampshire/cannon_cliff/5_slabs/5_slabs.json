Become established in this then pull straight through the roof and head up to another overlap/roof and belay on its right. This is a fun pitch on nice rock.  \n\n  P3, 110' 5.9    Break right from the belay and traverse under the roof until it ends then climb up to the base of the central of three corners (the really nice one that can be seen from the ground). Jam up the absolutely splitter crack and perfect corner to its top. Watch for loose rock as you pull out of the corner (I cleaned one big jug) and build a belay at a slung spike.  \n\n  A two rope rappel from here gets you back to the first belay. A single 60m rope from the first belay gets you close enough to the ground to scramble off.  \n\n  Certainly not a classic but after the first pitch the rock quality is good and seems stable.","protection":"A standard rack up to a #3 camalot with doubles in #1 and #2 should do you just fine but a second #3 wouldn't hurt if you've got it. On pitch three its best to save two #1's and at least one #2 and possibly a #3 for the corner. Four pieces should stitch it right up, three seemed adequate.","location":"About a hundred or so feet left of weissners below the three leaning corners.
