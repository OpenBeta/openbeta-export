The cliff is a bit overgrown these days but good climbing can still be found. With some cleaning efforts some more routes would be worth while. The routes here are mostly trad but there are a couple sport routes as well. An easy approach close to the saco river."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:15.680Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:20:07.555Z"}
