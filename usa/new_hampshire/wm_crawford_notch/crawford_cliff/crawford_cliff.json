The climbs are named after the Crawford family, who were some of the earliest settlers to this area.\n\n There is a 2 bolt rap anchor at the top of the cliff that is shared for the 3 climbs on the face. Use this rap to cut down erosion on the climbers path. It is 8' back from the top out so bring something to extend the anchor if you want to top rope the climbs.
