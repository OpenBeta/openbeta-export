Further away from the gully at cliff line begin up a long rope's length pitch This crux pitch finishes on the top of the gully edge. Belay and incredibly easy 5th class goes on for two pitches on the edge (5.0 to 3). Finish diagonally up east or right on (5.4) face and mantles for a long pitch. I first free soloed it and later on in the fall I brought brother Larry to do it. In rope lengths this climb is at least 500 feet. It snowed heavily on us at the summit and we hiked down the southeast sided trail instead of rappelling. Some climbs up Mt. Webster are more of a testament to a climberÂ’s endurance than they are in the degree of difficulty to climbing there if the weather is the opponent.","protection":"Excellent where needed.","location":"Go as you would in winter to where the cascade begins. The climb begins to the right of this cascading gully by going around the east or right of gully's buttress to become below an over one hundred foot wall of rock. Climb via the obvious diagonal feature heading towards the buttress's upper edge."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,a371d6cf-4535-59d7-a60d-f3f2d565c576,d9e60513-5d1c-58c6-ba96-5778b5490be2","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","WM: Crawford Notch","Unsorted Crawford Notch Routes"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.40672,44.19698]},"bbox":[-71.40734718717026,44.19653033981814,-71.40609281282975,44.19742966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110931728","area_id":"2eYFE10cWMa6lld4tUkL4g=="},"content":{"description":"Temporary area to hold routes while reorganizing"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:12:08.954Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:46:26.818Z"}
