Steve said to me \"Cover your ears,\" then fired off a couple warning shots with his 357.

Looming above are three significant cruxes, two much needed rests, and a whole lot of burly crack climbing in between. Battle a section of #4s to the first crux, which is comprised of sequential tight finger jams at weird angles. Get to the next wide looking section and find yourself in a great rest where you can liberally swap between hand jams and forget how steep it is. When you're fresh again progress through a pumpy section leading to another crux where the crack makes a V. Navigate this using tricky beta and you'll find yourself traversing a juggy rail only to wind up putting your whole leg into a hole that goes all the way to the knee. Rest up and tackle that last little redpoint crux. Mantle to the anchor stance, you earned it.  - 70', two bolt anchor, though you may want to construct a gear anchor if you are going to belay here for the second pitch. No 357 needed, but you are going to need your guns.\n\n P2: 5.12a Continue up the corner and switch back left. Follow the short and burly horizontal (fingers) to pull around the lip. 40' Currently no fixed anchor and dirty. You will have to continue up the low angles dirty cracks to the top out.
