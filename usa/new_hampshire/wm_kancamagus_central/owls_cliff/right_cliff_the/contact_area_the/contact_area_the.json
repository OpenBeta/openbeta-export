Jam and undercling it until you traverse right some and up a final face to the shared anchors of the Wimpy-Ass Flake. If you don't want to lead it, you can climb the easy flake and set up a TR, but you will still need gear for directional. Some of the gear on the lower part of the crack is a little awkward to place on the lead. If you are lucky you may find a fixed nut or two. \n\n  This is a good route, but it will likely need some re-cleaning as it hasn't been climbed on in a while.","protection":"Nuts and cams to a bolted anchor","location":"The left side of the start of the approach gully"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,8a63706f-b14c-536f-b8ab-3cea90093e36,520d135f-cf28-57c4-92cb-49590e2b2090,a1a67408-3de3-52a8-9ed8-ea90603a2246,41ee88f3-f1a1-5308-bf2d-ea735cd94dbf,652c276e-1da6-51da-85e0-ee0eaa6c27d0","pathTokens":["USA","New Hampshire","WM: Kancamagus (Central)","Owl's Cliff","Right Cliff, The","Contact Area, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.3591,44.043]},"bbox":[-71.35972555475462,44.042550339818135,-71.35847444524536,44.04344966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107009016","area_id":"ZSwnbh2mUdqF4O4Oqmwn0A=="},"content":{"description":"This consists of the left hand side of Death Gully and down around left to the lower section of rock.
