Slither up thin, hollow-sounding, but seemingly solid flakes to get to it. The crack climbs as good as it looks--if only it were longer! Note: the guidebook says it's a hand crack but it's fingers. At the overhang jog left, power up a steep left-facing flake to easier terrain and a succession of left-facing flakes. Belay wherever (we stopped at a small ledge at about 120'). From here, continue up more left-facing flakes to the big ledge (5.5, maybe 80').\n\nDescent: scramble left along the ledge for maybe 200-300 feet or more. We rapped too soon, from a small tree only 70 feet left of the route and our single 70m rope did not reach so we had to do a second rap from a small flake. Best to keep scrambling left to, well, I'm not sure but presumably either a shorter rap or a scramble all the way down.","protection":"Standard rack from Green Alien to #3 Camalot","location":"The climb is maybe 70 feet left of the start of Cowgirls' Dream.
