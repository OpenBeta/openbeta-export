The Greenies were cruising the North Laramie Range under the influence of barley pop yet spotted this prominent line from the main Rd.  Sometime during that adventurous weekend they rolled the vehicle over and as all were unhurt they kept climbing in Colorado Fashion.  See pic for gaining some beta.
