Sometimes it feels like the world disappears beneath your feet - very exciting!\n\nTowards the top of the first pitch you'll encounter two bolts right on the arete - stop here if you intend to do the \"right\" version of the 2nd pitch.  This isn't a great stance unfortunately.  Continue up to the big ledge with multiple sets of bolted anchors if you intend to climb the other version of the 2nd pitch (which is the rightmost bolted line off this ledge).\n\nI've only climbed the \"right\" version of the 2nd pitch.  From the chain anchors on the arete, move up and right through very steep and challenging climbing.  Fortunately it is well bolted (though the first bolt off the anchor is a ways). I found this climbing very difficult and hard to read - more 11- than 10+ in my book.  The steep climbing takes you back onto the arete, and more tenuous arete work.  A weird move from left to right across the arete finishes the difficult climbing.  You'll end on a big ledge.\n\nIf you've left your stuff at the top, you can do a dirty 5.7 pitch (bring nuts and a #1 Camalot) to gain a scramble off.\n\nOtherwise, rappel from the upper big ledge to the lower ledge with one rope (a 60m will make it).  Then rappel from the lower ledge with either two ropes, or you can stop at an intermediate stance about 40 feet off the ground.  The anchors are hidden in the big corner.","protection":"Bolts, LOTS of them.
