Easy climbing, but plenty of exposure.  The only problem on this route is that it is tricky to belay without a bit of rope drag.  From the belay ledge, traverse right along the prominent horizontal crack, placing two or three cams to protect.  The first bolt is just above and to the right of a small chimney/alcove.  The rest of the climb is safely bolted, with a small runout scramble to the chains.  From the chains, it's an easy scramble over the top to walk off.","protection":"The arete has bolts to a chain anchor, but you might want to use some #2 cams to protect the traverse.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,31f0b3e8-73a9-54f4-83f5-d9333decc2e6,00b95477-373b-5c05-aa9e-3febbdca8d99,958c027b-27b1-5aef-bb52-7d94af1e7293","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Jackson Hole","Jackson Hole Mountain Resort","S&S Couloir"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":2,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.8683,43.5958]},"bbox":[-110.86892088686415,43.59535033981814,-110.86767911313588,43.59624966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107660084","area_id":"lYwCeyexWu+7Un2Urx5ykw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:18.764Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:25:29.038Z"}
