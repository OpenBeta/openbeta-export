You have a left hand in a crack and your right hand on a side pull then you have to smear really high on a bulge and reach a one finger vertical pinch. Be sure to keep your stomach really close to the rock when pulling up on the pinch. After you get over the bulge it's basically a thin (kind of trick/spooky) slab climb to the top.","protection":"Crash pads and spotters","location":"The route is located on the east side of the boulder under the roof. Start in a vertical crack, then you transition into a horizontal crack. The route then follows the obvious crack. To get off the boulder, down climb the west side where you will see some rock steps.

The crux move is REACHING to a high decent hold and then trying to get yourself up on a slopey ledge. Only bad thing about this problem is that the first jug broke once, and sounds hollow still. Gets spooky after you get past crux, you are making reachy foot smears. You'll only do this one once and won't want to do it again for a while.","protection":"Pads and spotters.","location":"The problem is the next problem to the right of \"King Without A Crown.\" It is on the northeast side of the boulder.
