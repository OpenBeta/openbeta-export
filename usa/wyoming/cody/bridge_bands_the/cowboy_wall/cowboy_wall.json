I busted an air Jordan slam dunk-style dyno off a big ledge to a massive letterbox slot in a horizontal crack, though ample footholds in the roof mean shorties have a way out too. Very enjoyable climbing and quite a memorable crux move (at least the way I did it).\n\nA tall person (or one with an awesome ape index) would probably have a laughably easy time with this crux.\n\nHistorical reference- Buffalo Bill Cody was chief of scouts for the 3rd calvary in the late 1860s.
