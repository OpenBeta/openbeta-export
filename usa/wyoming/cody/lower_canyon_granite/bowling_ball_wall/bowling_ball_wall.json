The first two pitches are solid slab climbing with a lone bolt on the first pitch and the second pitch starts with a fun and steep band of rock that bisects the wall.  The third pitch weaves its way up a somewhat loose chimney and tops out to the right on the  prominent tower at the top of the slab.
