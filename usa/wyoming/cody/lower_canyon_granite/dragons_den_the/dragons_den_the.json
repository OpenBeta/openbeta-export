Heavy manufacturing was done on this one by who knows who, but for what it's worth, the vast majority of holds are simply improvements to existing features, so the climbing still has a natural feel. Start on a well-built platform at an incredibly obvious drilled pocket (Stick clip mandatory). Climb a hard intro sequence to some good holds. Find yourself in a V9 or 10 crux before the climbing backs off to around V4 or 5. Cop a rest on a huge jug directly under the arete. The arete is spectacular, all natural 5.12. So so so good.
