The route ascends Buffalo Horn Spire on its north arete. The spire was first climbed (left of  M11) by a pair of Montanans  using only a few bolts and in a very bold manner. M11 is an excellent rock climb and big adventure. For the most part it has excellent rock, though rockfall from the ledges is possible and, of course, anything this long will have a loose block here and there. All anchors are set up so they do not need webbing. All parties should take a wrench with them to tighten any bolts that have loosened with time. If you need to bivy the best spot is in the notch at pitch 14.\n\npitch 1 = Find the start next to a couple of trees near where the fence meets the wall. Climb up and right for 20 meters passing 6 bolts to a good ledge. 5.9\n\npitch 2 = Move up and left onto steeper ground then over a bulge to a stance belay. 6 bolts, 5.10a\n\npitch 3 = Hit the crux right above the belay (5.10b) then move up and right along a dihedral, then over the dihedral and up a clean face to a good ledge. 25 meters long with 9 bolts\n\npitch 4 = Climb  up broken corners pretty much straight up to a ledge. 7 bolts and 5.7\n\npitch 5 = Climb very clean rock for 30 meters to a sloping alcove. 7 bolts\n\npitch 6 = Climb up and right to a dihedral, move left to a smaller ledge. 7 bolts and 25 meters\n\npitch 7 = Go up and left passing a bulge on its left, then climb very smooth rock and traverse back right and down a few feet to a belay at a tree. 5.10d, 30 meters, 11 bolts\n\npitch 8 = Climb a clean face to nubbins on the right at 5.10c for 30 meters. 9 bolts\n\npitch 9 = The crux. Difficult to flash. Climb up and right along a corner, then pull over the bulge and reach a steep headwall. Climb this  and then pass onto the slab above on the right side of the bulge to a nice ledge with a tree. This can be done as 5.10-C0 but its reachy... an extender quickdraw is useful. To free it is 5.11c and you need 14 quickdraws. 33 meters.\n\npitch 10 = Climb a clean face straight up to a large ledge for 33 meters. 9 bolts\n\npitch 11 = Climb up and right, passing a shrubbery with a move that seems it might be slightly harder than 5.8, then between  some trees to an alcove. 34 meters and 7 bolts\n\npitch 12 = Climb up and into the obvious runnel. It gets easier as you get higher. 5.10d, 30 meters, and has 10 bolts.\n\npitch 13 = Go up over a couple bulges then trend left to the summit of  the lower slabs. Its 5.8 and has 5 bolts where you need them. 27 meters\n\npitch 14 = Carefully downclimb into the notch, about 15 feet of 5.3, then hike up past a few trees for 50-60 feet.\n\npitch 15 = Climb up and slightly left then trend right on 5.9 climbing for 27 meters. 8 bolts.\n\npitch 16 = Climb up and slightly right on very clean rock with a 5.10b crux. There is a ledge with a nasty yucca to grab your rope. 27 meters and 7 bolts\n\npitch 17 = Climb up and right over a series of bulges to a good ledge with 7 bolts for 25 meters. Its 5.10c.\n\npitch 18 = Again up and a little more right on slightly easier ground  for 25 meters to a good ledge. 6 bolts at 5.8\n\npitch 19 = Climb up and onto the arete then trend back left into a large alcove. 5.6, 25 meters, and 4 bolts\n\npitch 20 = follow the arete for 25 meters to a small stance where it steepens. This is 5.5 and has only 4 bolts. If you bring enough quickdraws you can link this pitch with the next.\n\npitch 21 = Climb up the broken crack then follow the arete, using both sides, for 34 meters to a hanging stance just below a ledge. Any further and you could not have rappelled it with a single 70meter rope.\n\npitch 22 = Climb some broken ground then trend left onto a bulge to a stance just a few feet below the summit. Its 25 meters and has 4 bolts at 5.7.\n\nRappel the route on a single 70 meter rope (not a 68 meter rope). Be careful with those ends as some of the pitches max out the 70 meter rope.

The thing I would liken it to is the regular route on Shiprock, but with much better rock quality and far more permanent protection.\n\nThe route ascends 2,500 feet of mostly excellent rock that is broken into 4 different sections by steep hiking. This route is bolted in European-alpine style, so there are bolts at the cruxes and a few per pitch, but you may want some gear as well. The first ascent was done without cams, but we recommend a single rack of cams from .4 to 3 Friend. All protections is stainless steel and the anchors are set up in French style and do not need webbing for equalization.\n\nLike Colter's Spire, the name is tied to the history of the area. In the Fall of 1877 Chief Joseph led the Nez Perce through Yellowstone National Park while attempting to elude the U.S. Cavalry. They descended out of the park via Clark's Fork Canyon and camped below this massif of rock, then continued north towards Canada. They were caught and surrendered in early October of that year. Chief Joseph said, in his surrender speech to General Oliver Howard,  \"I will fight no more forever.\" In memory of the chief, the tribe, and the history that is tied to this area, we gave it the name. Also, by the time you get to the 18th pitch you will probably say to yourself, \"damn, this thing goes on forever.\"\n\nIMPORTANT: The route is anchored so that it can be descended on a 70 meter rope (Not a 68 meter rope!). However, many of those rappels will go right to the end of your rope on an open face. Always tie knots. All bolts are stainless steel and should last at least half a century.

Do a slab   move to a ledge and anchor. 35M, 5.8 (easy if tall).\n\nP14      The \"Air Pitch.\" Climb up and left past a dead tree to an exposed arete. Follow it up and back right to a high anchor at the start of the trees. Use long slings on everything as          there will be drag. 50M, 5.5\n\nP15      Move over a couple slabs and into the trees amid loose scree and dirt. Move up and        right to the highpoint of the trees. Belay the next pitch left of a buttress of rock next to a         dead tree. Its about 75 feet down and right of the highpoint in the alcove. 3rd class,  80meters\n\nP16      The crux. Traverse up and right on questionable rock. Go over the bulge and do a             boulder problem and then follow the slab to a stance anchor. You can also clip it and          continue right to a small tree on a better ledge. These bolts can be clipped as an aid        ladder with an easy 5.10 move here and there or by standing in a sling. 5.12a or A0     (obl.5.10a) 20\n\nP17      Traverse right on scree and ledges broken by rock slabs, passing a rappel anchor, to a      large    ledge on the arete with a good anchor (no rap rings).

Either add a pitch by     belaying at one of the trees or continue up a broken face to an anchor  on a rock face       below another tree. 32M, 5.4\n\nP21      Climb to a cool summit with spectacular views. 15M, 5.5 Sign the register.\n\nDescent:\n\nTo descend the route with only a 70 meter rope, use these variations from the climbing route.\n\nThe highest rappel variation is from a stance on the arete left of the midpoint of pitch 18. It drops you onto the ledge you traverse for pitch 17. The second highest rappel variation is from a stance midway across pitch 17. This one is 35 meters to the forest below. Walk down and find the anchor atop pitch 14. The third variation is rappelling from pitch 14 anchor straight down to a second anchor on the left side of a gully. Its about 50 feet below. From that anchor rappel hard left (south) to the anchor for the Runnel Pitch. IT is a rope stretcher so tie knots in the ends. Note that the next rappel takes you to an anchor 6 feet above the belay ledge... again, knots in your rope. Do that rappel to the top of Pitch 11. From this one it is another stretcher.... go down to the tree you began this section on and you will reach. If you go straight down you will be disappointed. One more thing to note is the very bottom rappel at pitch one also requires you to traverse right (reversing exactly how you climbed it.) Always watch and knot your ends and you will be fine.. Or purchase an 80M rope before this route.","protection":"The route was climbed with a dozen draws and a few long slings.

Foreshortening makes this not look like a big endeavor, but don't be fooled: you will likely spend 2.5-3 hours just rappelling the route. It’s a big day.\n\nThe route ascends 1400 feet of Madison limestone and is protected, mostly, by bolts. The F.A. was done without cams, but you might want a set from .4 to 3 friend. Also, a couple long slings and ten quickdraws are necessary. Obviously you need more draws if you intend to link pitches, which is easy to do. All protection is stainless steel and should last a very long time in this environment. The anchors, all half inch 5-piece bolts, are set up in French Style and do not need equalization. The entire route can be climbed and rappelled with a 70 meter rope, but pay attention to the ends.\n\nThe name is tied to the interesting history of the area. In the winter of 1807-8, John Colter trekked south from near Billings, passing below the route and into Clarks Fork Canyon. As far as we can tell, this made him the first member of the white tribe to enter Wyoming. His trek took him south into the Wind River Valley, over Togwotee Pass and thus past the Tetons, and into Idaho, before turning north and passing back out of Yellowstone just north of this massive. Again, in winter, and with a 35 pound pack in dangerous territory. It could be compared to the great treks to the poles in bravery and endurance. Because he likely camped below the massif, we named this route and the associated spire after him. For more on Colter I recommend Wyoming: A History of the American West.\n\nIMPORTANT: The route is anchored so that it can be descended on a 70 meter rope (Not a 68 meter rope!).
