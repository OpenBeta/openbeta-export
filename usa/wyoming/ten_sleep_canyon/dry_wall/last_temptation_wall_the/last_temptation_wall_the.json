No chalk, widely spaced bolts, and technical slab climbing make this climb really engaging and fun.\n\nStart with a difficult slab on holds that all seem to be facing the wrong direction. Continue questing up until the 4th bolt or so where you can get a good rest and remember to breathe again. The 2nd half of the climb weaves up and right, occasionally using the arete, until finally moving left to the chains at the top.\n\nI thought the crux was on the slab right after the 2nd bolt. Really fun and a different style of climb for Tensleep.","protection":"8 bolts","location":"The right most line on the black slab.
