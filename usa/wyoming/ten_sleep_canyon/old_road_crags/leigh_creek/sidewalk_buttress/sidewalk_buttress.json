One, the whole buttress is a bit crumbly compared to the routes up at Mondo Beyondo.   And two, the final 35 feet just aren't as good as the first 90 feet. Finally, if you have been paying attention to the math, you can't do this route with a single 70M rope - it is too long.  So you either have to trail a rope or if you fail to do that you will have to do a messy leaver biner rappel OR potentially a funky double rap/lower using the midpoint anchors on the route to the left.   Acck!\n\nAll this needs to jump to a 4 star route is an anchor just after the crux, say at about 95 feet, and a little traffic to clean things up.  Any civic-minded bolters out there, this would be a great service!  Make sure you add the anchors AFTER the crux (just under the little roof would be good) and it won't change the grade at all.\n\nThis a really fun line!","protection":"About 25 bolts to anchors at 125 feet.
