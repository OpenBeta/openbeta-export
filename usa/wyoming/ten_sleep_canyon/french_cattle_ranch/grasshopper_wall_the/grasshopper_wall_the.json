The original start, shared with Sugar Mama, traversed in from the left following a crack which peters out as it gains the gold streak at the fifth bolt.  Long moves between amazing pockets and small crimps lead up the remaining six bolts.\n\nFour new bolts go directly up the gold streak to the beginning of the original crux.  Start at the eye level flake and do some thin slab moves at the second bolt.  Then zig zag a bit following the best holds you can find till joining the original line.\n\nThe upper section has many hard, long moves up vertical terrain with marginal feet.  I particularly love the \"peanut\" hold which is a shallow oblong pocket for your index and ring, but too pinched off for the middle.  A pair of good rest holds allow a shake before the undercling and crimp sequence guarding the last bolt before the anchors.\n\nThe original guide called this the best line on the wall, and I feel that the direct start improves the continuity and the aesthetics.
