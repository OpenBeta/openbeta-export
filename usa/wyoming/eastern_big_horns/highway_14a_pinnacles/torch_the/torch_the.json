Scramble up a couple short steps and make a few moves to clip the first bolt. Start up the ladder, with a couple intermediate bomber hook placements. A short crack is followed near the top, with a couple placements in the crack. Beware, one of the bolts near the beginning of the crack is bad (it'll be obvious as the loose stud sticking most of the way out of the rock). There's a better bolt next to it to use. From the upper ledge and tree anchor, a short easy boulder problem leads to the summit and cairn.","protection":"Bring some bolt hangers or nuts to slide over bolt studs, as none were left behind (just studs and nuts). A small rack of medium-large stoppers and a couple cams #.75-#2, one bathook and one skyhook. One rope. Bring some webbing to replace the anchor.","location":"Out of the notch on the uphill side. The first bolt stud is about 20' up."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,2667c95c-0d0e-5aaa-b086-26231db58b39,1192b0e4-5bb6-5b78-89a2-5823882a8e1f,1adfb68d-3d8f-5d99-8c00-438dc7b09dc9","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Eastern Big Horns","Highway 14a Pinnacles","Torch, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.62777,44.76814]},"bbox":[-107.62840335769901,44.76769033981815,-107.62713664230097,44.76858966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106074941","area_id":"Gt+2jT2PXZmMAEONx7CdyQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.62840335769901,44.76769033981815],[-107.62713664230097,44.76769033981815],[-107.62713664230097,44.76858966018187],[-107.62840335769901,44.76858966018187],[-107.62840335769901,44.76769033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:17.144Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:15.885Z"}
