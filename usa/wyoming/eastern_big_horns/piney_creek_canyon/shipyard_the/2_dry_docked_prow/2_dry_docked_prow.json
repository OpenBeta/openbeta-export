Stick clip the first bolt. Start more left than  you would think and climb somewhat dirty rock for a few moves. Climb big hero moves out the prow and reach the apex of the curve. Here, the route steps left and leads to a technical headwall crux. If you have enough endurance, this may not actually be that hard, but it definitely requires one to keep their head on straight to the anchors. Stop here for 12d points, keep going up for the ultimate Shipyard line, an open project, for 13b points?","protection":"At least 12 bolts.
