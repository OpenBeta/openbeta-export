The crux is near the middle of the climb near a small roof with few holds.  The route has solid rock but is dirty in places.","protection":"There is no fixed gear but anchors can be easily made on top by hiking up behind cliff. The route can either be top roped or lead on trad gear.  The gear is sparse in places but adequate.  Small cams or tcu's and small stoppers work well.","location":"The route starts on a obvious legde 10 ft off the ground and approximately 10 feet from edge of the ledge to the west.
