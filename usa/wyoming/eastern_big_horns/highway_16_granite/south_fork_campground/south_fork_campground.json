Many variations exist, but my favorite is straight up the middle, all the way to the top. Perfectly solid rock with many features that take an assortment of nuts and cams.\n\nFirst bit is maybe the crux, flaring diagonal crack is weird to protect, but it's easy enough to climb through to the first good gear placement at 15ft.\n\nAt this point, traverse right a few feet to some shallow huecos and climb up to the next diagonal crack. Follow the crack for a bit then go up to a low angle slab.\n\nFor the final bit, climb into the right facing dihedral and build your anchor in the corner at the very top.\n\nThe center route is the longest(and best)climb, but climbing the right or left side of the slab is quite pleasant as well.","protection":"Set of small to med nuts, and cams from .5 up to 3.
