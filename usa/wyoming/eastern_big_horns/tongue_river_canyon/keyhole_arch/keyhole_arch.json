Caution:  poor rock quality and plenty of loose.  Equalized bush belay (bring very long runners).\n\nPitch 2 (5.9, 50') Begins on the east face of the arch, approximately 15' to the north of the arch opening.  Ascend a thin flaring crack (difficult to protect) to a good ledge (1st crux).  Stay left to follow finger crack and broken ledge system to a very large ledge (2' wide).  Pull mantle on a verticle to slighly overhung block to gain summit (long arms help and this move may be protected by slinging a small bush).  Gear and bush anchor.  This climb is not sustained with only a few 5.9 moves.  Again, there is much loose rock - climb and place gear with caution.\n\nDescent: Simul-rappel with your partner off opposite sides of the arch!","protection":"Small to medium stoppers, #0.3-0.75 Camalots, slings to minimize rope drag.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,2667c95c-0d0e-5aaa-b086-26231db58b39,2894f112-f2f5-5a87-9149-21c178e445f3,5cf0d3e8-6350-5cb9-9a18-635b34372733","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Eastern Big Horns","Tongue River Canyon","Keyhole Arch"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.32675,44.84623]},"bbox":[-107.32738421571017,44.84578033981814,-107.32611578428983,44.846679660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107079668","area_id":"XPDT6GNQXLmaGGNbNDcnMw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.32738421571017,44.84578033981814],[-107.32611578428983,44.84578033981814],[-107.32611578428983,44.846679660181856],[-107.32738421571017,44.846679660181856],[-107.32738421571017,44.84578033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:14.893Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:02.201Z"}
