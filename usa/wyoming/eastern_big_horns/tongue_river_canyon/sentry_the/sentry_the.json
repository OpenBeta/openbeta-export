Small stoppers offer less-than-ideal pro, be careful. Once beneath the bulging upper hand crack, sink in a good #3 camalot and skirt right onto the arete. Follow this for several more cruxy spots to a small ledge. Clip a bolt and crimp up chert past some suspect blocks to the top. An engaging climb that involves much cerebral maneuvering with some questionable pro.","protection":"Small cams to #.75\n\nSmall/medium stoppers\n\n3 bolts\n\nChain anchor","location":"The striking crack on the up-canyon end of the uphill face.
