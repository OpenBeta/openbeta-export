A tough and bouldery start get you up to the high first bolt. Unless you are some sort of he-man, I would bring a stick clip or a BD #2 to protect the start. A fall when clipping the first bolt or just before would really ruin your day. Anyway, after the first bolt, you make some big moves to good holds and horns as you turn the lip of the mini-cave. From there it's straight up through some tricky to see sweet spots in the horizontal fissures. The route is short, tough, well-bolted and definitely a fun outing that is worth the walk if you're in the area and the fish aren't biting.","protection":"5 bolts, shuts, stick clip or BD #2","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"LLKhtncvV164z9AonuSNtA==","name":"Over the Line","yds":"5.9+","grades":{"yds":"5.9+","french":"5c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.52485,44.78635]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"115143605","mp_crag_id":"115143586","climb_id":"LLKhtncvV164z9AonuSNtA==","areaRef":"aIqKK89CXiiZICQ1lbyTAw=="},"content":{"description":"Big edges and sidepulls up the wall. It is possible to use a number 2 BD as you near the top and hit a sort of ledge, but it is not necessary for the added drag plus you can clip the next bolt as soon as you stand up tall on the ledge. The anchors were positioned a bit left for rock quality, but head straight up past the last bolt for the best finish. Fun route for the area and grade.
