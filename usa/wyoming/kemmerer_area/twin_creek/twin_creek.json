Definitely not for those scared of falling.","protection":"Crack under the roof has a good spot for a #.5 and #3, the crack going up the upper section take #.75 or #1, whichever you prefer.

From the ledge up is a beautiful, slightly overhanging hand crack.\n\nThe first section can be bypassed by climbing the beginning of 465 Easy St. up to the Fork in the Road ledge, then traversing over to the crack.
