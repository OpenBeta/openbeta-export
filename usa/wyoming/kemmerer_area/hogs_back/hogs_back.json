I did have problems with some of the bolts, I used a bolt that I do not normally use at the Hogs Back. All of the bolts are bomb and not cause for real concern, however I did have a problem with bolt number 3, when I went to replace I had the same problem happen. Both of the bolts are fine it is really more of me wanting it to be perfect. For now there are two bolts there, I have plans to replace both. I equalized them together both for the fa.
