This route is the only one on the tower currently, and is the only really viable weakness offering a free line. It surmounts the steep downhill face via a stair-step flake/crack. The flake starts trending left, then it diagonals back right up to a large ledge about 12' below the summit and up a final crack groove. Much of the climbing involves hand and finger cracks, some of which are quite sharp (tape recommended). There are several short isolated crux sequences between good rest ledges and stances. Some large hollow blocks must be moved over with caution, and can't be entirely avoided.","protection":"A double rack of camalots through #2, with one #3 and one #4, a single set of stoppers, lots of extended runners or double ropes due to the zig-zag nature of the route, and about 5' of replacement webbing for the upper tree anchor.","location":"On the downhill, down-canyon edge of the tower is a stair-stepped flake system."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,60938582-b7b6-515b-a1d9-26cd9a75e2bd,7fc158b9-3f48-5a11-9056-3bdc369ff4d0,1091a4e9-40a7-54d8-9e3a-3b7b2bbd1b19","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Shell Canyon","Granite Creek Towers","Whistlepig, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.842,43.0046]},"bbox":[-107.84261487875098,43.00415033981815,-107.841385121249,43.00504966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106189786","area_id":"EJGk6UCnVNieOjt7K70bGQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.84261487875098,43.00415033981815],[-107.841385121249,43.00415033981815],[-107.841385121249,43.00504966018187],[-107.84261487875098,43.00504966018187],[-107.84261487875098,43.00415033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:26.301Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:29.505Z"}
