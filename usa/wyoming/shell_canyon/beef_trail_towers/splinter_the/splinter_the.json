Wriggle up this past 4-5 chockstones (bring several double or triple-length runners).

A couple medium stoppers and a 1\" cam for P2. 2 bolt anchor on top. Bring replacement webbing.","location":"Obvious chimney on west (down-canyon side of spire). The short second pitch starts directly out of the notch between the summit pinnacle and the cliff. Rap off the opposite face from the route (140'); or, rap down to the notch (25') and scramble off on ledges on the up-canyon side of the spire past dense brush (kind of a thrash)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,60938582-b7b6-515b-a1d9-26cd9a75e2bd,92fb5712-06ee-5174-adc3-cbef6161c6d5,d63295fd-3b75-5e21-b105-4042db6bb471","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Shell Canyon","Beef Trail Towers","Splinter, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.842,43.0046]},"bbox":[-107.84261487875098,43.00415033981815,-107.841385121249,43.00504966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106155641","area_id":"1jKV/Tt1XiGxBUBC22u0cQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-107.84261487875098,43.00415033981815],[-107.841385121249,43.00415033981815],[-107.841385121249,43.00504966018187],[-107.84261487875098,43.00504966018187],[-107.84261487875098,43.00415033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:26.302Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:29.518Z"}
