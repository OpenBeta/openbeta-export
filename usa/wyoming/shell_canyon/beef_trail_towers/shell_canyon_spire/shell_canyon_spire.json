Stand atop the fin that comprises the right side of the crack, clip a bolt and get the etriers out. Aid on the bolt to great horizontal finger cracks leading left with bomber placements (.3-.4 camalots) to a large bush (solid placement) and up to a stance and anchors. Pull onto the summit and scramble up to the summit boulders and cairn.\n\nWith some cleaning this could easily go free. It wouldn't be that hard, it just has some dubious rock right now in key spots. Easy, airy aid as is.","protection":"#3, #4, #4.5 or C4 #5 camalots, 1 bolt, .3 and .4 (1-2 of each), 2 bolt anchor.
