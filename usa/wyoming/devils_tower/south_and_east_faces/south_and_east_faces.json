Though rated 10d by Royal Robbins in 1964 I think most people would agree that Robbins really put up the first 5.11 on the Tower! The original route starts one crack to the left of the main crack with 2 pitons that protect a short but spicy traverse to the right to gain the main crack. Or you can do the direct start like I did at a supposed easier grade of 10c, though it still felt like 11a/b to me! With the direct start fight your way up flared and leaning fingers/hands until finally reaching good jams about 25-30 feet up. With the original start you skip out on some of the flared fingers, but instead have what looked to be a short but tricky traverse. After passing a bush the crack becomes mostly #3 and #4 camalot size for about 100 feet, turns into a really fun double cracks and then makes a traverse to the left about 20 feet below a roof. Continue from here up an offwidth (protected by a red totem/#1 camalot in a horizontal) for about 10 feet to a nice big ledge. The best gear you can get for an anchor here is #4 camalot size or larger, so save at least 1 of those. There only other anchor piece option is a tiny but decent nut placement to the right of the crack in a horizontal. For pitch 2 (5.9) continue up the wide, dirty chimney (the home of the pigeons) until you encounter a body length sized roof. A #3 and #4 protect this well. After that you are practically at the meadows. Build your own anchor. Move to the left to descend the Meadows rappels.","protection":"Nuts, single green c3, and doubles from blue metolius size gear up to #2 camalot.

Rack up here, then continue to the right on the 3rd and 4th class ramp until you reach the roping up area for the route, Bon Homme. Danse Macabre is 8 cracks to the left of the start of Bon Homme. Continue back to the left for about 50 or 60 feet until a flat area is reached. From here I did a short approach pitch to the base of the route. Watch out for a large loose flake (about 3ft x 4ft) that is sitting precariously just down and left of the start of the main crack. It is easily avoided but it moved a few inches when I put my hand on it."},"__v":0},{"_id":"+yAe5S5hWiOX1Mr2wLIB0Q==","name":"Dancing With The Devils After Dark","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"June 2006 by Nate ChossMonkey and Bigwally","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true},"safety":"R","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-104.71457,44.58986]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106062246","mp_crag_id":"105714384","climb_id":"+yAe5S5hWiOX1Mr2wLIB0Q==","areaRef":"v/KzJDOOUnawru3nUGqReg=="},"content":{"description":"The Steepest Face of Devils Tower is the South West Face.
