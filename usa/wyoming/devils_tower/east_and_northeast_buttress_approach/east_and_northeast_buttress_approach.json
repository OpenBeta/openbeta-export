If you are under about 5'10\", you might find the bolt after this one placed just out of reach from the obvious clipping stance.  After the crux, the climbing eases off somewhat until you reach a ledge where you might expect to find anchors, only to find four more bolts (happily, more closely spaced) on an imposingly blank slab; fear not, this secondary crux is not as featureless as it first appears.\n\nDescent: 50+ meter rap from two bolts.","protection":"At least 15 QDs and long runners.  I brought a light rack but only placed one piece, an unnecessary yellow Alien; there are virtually no other placement opportunities any where else where you might want additional gear.\n\nA large nut and a finger size cam (~ .4 Camalot) are needed to establish a belay at the start.","location":"This shady pitch is a few cracks right of Belle Fourche Buttress.  A picture would be worth at least 1000 of my words here -- consult a guidebook for the exact location of the pitch.  The best way to get to the route is to go to Teacher's ledge and then traverse easily almost straight left to the start keeping an eye out for poison ivy.

This pitch is probably a 5.6 or so.  To the left are 2 eye bolts for an anchor.  Continue from the anchors as P2 becomes a set of dual cracks with some increased difficulty and trickiness towards the end.  This pitch ends on a nice ledge, where you can move left about 20 ft or so to access Assembly Line.  If you are feeling comfortable at the good stances, the second can do a bit of modified simul-climbing (clipping to the leader's pieces occasionally) to do this as a pseudo single pitch climb.\n\nLike many DT climbs, there is no move as difficult as the route's rating.
