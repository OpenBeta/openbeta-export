Most people will probably find the approach and descent more demanding than the climb itself.  The climbing generally consists of short, steep sections with lots of scrambling in between.  Retreat from the route would probably entail much downclimbing.\n\nApproach:  Cross Jenny Lake somehow, then walk up the Cascade Canyon trail for about three miles, until past the Valhalla streambed.  Ford the river (< 12\" deep in late August) and head steeply up the west side of the Valhalla streambed.  If you're lucky, you'll find a pronounced trail; otherwise you'll probably follow intermittent trails.  Either will get you to the lower reaches of VC where the trail ends and the slope eases off.\n\nNote: We were able to find water in the middle part of VC (while still in the basin, before scrambling up onto the slopes of Owen itself) late in the season.  We didn't see any convenient water source above this.\n\nThe crux of Serendipity is probably finding the start.  We lost a lot of time by convincing ourselves that the route started lower than it did which resulted in a lot of completely unnecessary scrambling.  The key to avoiding this mistake is to identify a large, very prominent, orangey left-facing corner with a square roof at the bottom of its right side.  Identify this corner from the basin and then accept the fact that the route starts about a pitch below the large corner, surprisingly far above you.  A secondary landmark is a long, shallow black roof below and slightly right of the large corner; this feature is passed to its left about 25M into the first pitch.  From the middle of the basin, don't beeline for the corner.  Instead, continue up VC, toward the Grand, until almost the end of the canyon.  Now go left/E, up scree towards the Gunsight, gaining several hundred feet.   At some point, trusting your instincts and judgement, cut left/north when it seems like you could traverse more or less horizontally to a point about 25M below the long black roof.  Eventually, you'll encounter a descending slab below a roof/cave which will take you to a small, stamped out area at the base of a 5M right facing corner.  This is the start.  Getting to the start from west side of Jenny Lake took us almost seven hours.  A quick party should probably allocate at least five hours without mistakes.\n\nP1.  Go straight up for a ways, passing the long, black  roof on its left, then traverse right on slabs, eventually encountering some FPs.  Try to traverse all the way around the arete, to a good stance at the base of a chimney. ~5.7, 75M.  (To break this pitch up, find an intermediate belay before the traverse, maybe on a pedestal left of the black roof.)\n\nP2. Go up the chimney, probably using a slippery hand crack, then continue up, trending left, on easier ground to the base of a slab with a 5\" crack on its left side.  ~5.7, 50M.\n\nP3. Up the slab w/ no pro (5.5?) and continue on easier ground to the top of the first tower. ~5.5, 50M.\n\nP4. Walk across the \"knife edge\" (it's a pretty blunt edge), climb a couple of moves up a block, then diagonal down right for about 10M and belay beneath broken, black rock.  Easy, 30M\n\nP5. Follow cracks up to a notch behind the 2nd tower.  ~5.6, 40M.\n\nP6. Climb cracks (straight up or veering right) and gain a ledgey area near the top of the 3rd tower.  ~5.5, 50M.\n\nNote: this area around the notch btw the 3rd & 4th ledges offers the best bivy spots on the route.\n\nP7.  Pass through the notch to left/NW side of the 4th Tower, then descend a ramp for a little ways until the rock above you looks climbable. 4th class, 20M.\n\nP8. Climb up for most of a rope until you reach easier ground.  ~5.7 50M.  Rossiter indicated this section was easier so maybe we were off route.\n\nP9.  Wander up, aiming for the right side of the ridge.  Keep going, past the 4th tower, until a notch btw the 4th tower and the next difficult section.  4th class 60M.\n\nP10.  Up past a warm up chimney type move to the base of a short, smooth, bulging 7\" crack. Either free climb this (allegedly 5.9) or aid up a thin crack just to its right (FP, red or green RP probably helpful) for a move or two.  Continue up easily until beneath the summit block. 5.7 C1 50M.\n\nP11. Scramble rightwards until at the base of the Koven chimney, a passage which goes all the way through the summit block.  4th class 50M.\n\nUnrope, and scramble up the chimney the remaining 100 feet to the summit.\n\nDescent: I can't speak entirely from personal experience since we kept going to the Grand, but the best bet seems to be descending the West Ledges back into Valhalla Canyon.  The general idea here is, starting from the base of the Koven chimney descend the east side of ridge running from Owen to the Gunsight (possibly 1 rap) until the obvious \"U notch\" where you crossover to the west and descend with a fair amount of downclimbing into Valhalla Canyon.","protection":"We took: 1 ea 1-8 Rocks, 1 ea green Alien through Blue Camalot, 1 ea 4 smallest Tricams, several long slings and biners.

It helps to have some familiarity with the Tetons in general and routes up Mt Owen specifically. This narrow couloir between the Crescent Arete and North Ridge is a striking line that catches the eye of any climber that has examined the northeast face of Mt Owen from the valley floor.\n\nIn the 1973 American Alpine Journal, Stephen Arsenault writes regarding the first ascent of the Run-Don’t-Walk Couloir, “Named from a distance several years ago, this couloir... has a particularly evil appearance, marked by rock scars and running water when it is not filled with ice.\" When Stephen and his climbing partner John Bouchard completed the first ascent in early July, 1972, they encountered a fifteen foot gap in the initial steep ice bulge that required a difficult pitch of A3 to bypass. The AAJ article notes, “For optimum conditions this route should be done earlier in the season when the ice would still be intact.”\n\nGenerally speaking, climbers should wait for an ideal melt-freeze cycle that provides continuous snow and ice throughout the route, and should start very early on a colder day to ensure that everything is locked up as much as possible. There’s a lot of potential for overhead hazard funneling into this feature. Falling rock and ice should be anticipated. With that being said, there are a number of relatively sheltered belay nooks throughout the route, including the two WI4 crux pitches.\n\nThe Ortenburger-Jackson guide notes, “The best time to find good ice conditions seems to be in the late spring or very early summer when cold temperatures permit the ice sections to form but after the spring avalanche cycle.”\n\nThe following description is from conditions found on June 9, 2020:\n\nPhase 1: Getting to the climb\n\nThe major crux of the approach is nailing the Cascade Creek crossing in the dark (and you probably want it to still be dark at this point). It is well worth the time to scout an adequate crossing during daylight hours and ensure this portion of the initial approach is known.\n\nThere are two options to get to the base of the RDW: The first is to approach via the lower portion of the Northeast Snowfields route, eventually veering west, traversing up and right to reach the base of the couloir. This was the path of the first ascent, and is detailed and pictured in the Ortenburger-Jackon guide.\n\nThe second option is to locate a fallen log crossing that is nearly in line with the toe of the North Ridge on Owen when viewed from the Cascade Canyon trail (it’s literally 50-100’ off the main trail). Cross Cascade Creek, wander through some braided tributaries of the creek, then move immediately up and right to locate a tongue of snow leading to a prominent couloir (up and left) that ascends directly to the base of the RDW, Crescent Arete, and North Ridge starts. This couloir is on the west (right) side of a prominent ridge that ends at McCain’s Pillar (a 150’ pinnacle that lies on the lower extension of the Crescent Arete). In early season, the McCain's Pillar Couloir is a fast, direct approach which is entirely on snow. From the upper couloir, the entrance to the RDW is clearly visible.\n\nPhase 2: Run. Don’t walk.\n\nIn early June, 2020, a short step of ice-covered rock guarded the entrance to the couloir. Rope up, and start climbing. Simul-climb for several hundred feet (600?) through the short rock step to reach steep snow and neve with ample rock pro along the walls of the couloir. Punch it and belay at the base of the first steep ice pitch (a nice sheltered nook).\n\nP2. Climb the steep curtain of ice, which likely varies in difficulty depending on conditions any given year (WI4ish). Run the rope to the base of the next steep ice step (55-60m).\n\nP3. Climb the initial ice bulge (WI4ish) to a flat stance then launch into the next steep ice step (slightly easier but more spongy and sun affected in early June, 2020). The most sheltered belay nook above made this pitch approximately 70-75m.\n\nP4. This is another long simul-climbing pitch on steep snow and neve. Take it several hundred feet (another 600?) to the top of the couloir. You're done with the Run-Don't-Walk.\n\nPhase 3: Topping out and descending\n\nThe top of the Run-Don’t-Walk Couloir puts one at a crossroads for going to the summit of Mt Owen (there’s still a bunch of terrain to cover to get to the top). Directly above the couloir sits the remainder of the North Ridge, including the most difficult climbing on the Great Yellow Tower. This option will add significant complications, including rock climbing up to 5.9 in likely alpine conditions. Although this would be the most impressive way to finish, it is far more difficult than other alternatives.\n\nOther options include:\n\n1) The traditional Northeast Snowfields finish (move down and left from the top of the RDW then climb direct to the top).\n\n2) Move down and left, then climb up and left, across the NE Snowfields, to reach the East Ridge or the Koven finish (probably the most popular option).\n\n3) Move down and left, then traverse hard left, contouring the vast NE Snowfield to reach the notch at the top of the Koven Couloir (this is the fastest way to descend off the mountain without reaching the true summit). The top of the RDW is basically at the same elevation as the Koven Couloir.\n\nA good option for going to the summit is to finish on the Koven (it’s important to be familiar with this route as well). The RDW linked with the Koven finish keeps the overall rating of the climb at (IV WI4 5.4). Once on the summit of Owen, reverse course and down-climb the Koven into Glacier Gulch. Hike out to the Lupine Meadows trailhead (either hitch a ride back to your car or arrange a shuttle).","protection":"8 or so ice screws, a single rack from small tcu to #3 camalot, stoppers.

Owen is one of the premier moderate alpine routes in the Tetons.  The climbing encountered varies tremendously from year to year and season to season so the exact line chosen can vary accordingly.  I'll describe the conditions and route we climbed in early summer following a winter and spring that had very heavy snowfall.\n\nOnce on the first snowfield, we trended a bit right (west) and crossed the first cliff band on a slab that was easy mixed climbing and some friction moves.  You can get small gear in cracks on the slab if needed.  This brought us to the lower west edge of the 2nd snowfield.  The snow of the second snowfield is moderately steep and we were fortunate to find stiff styrofoam conditions that, combined with simuclimbing made for fast progress.\n\nAt the top of the second snowfield, we encountered a cliff band that had moderate mixed conditions with good protection that led to west edge of the 3rd snowfield.  The 3rd snowfield is the steepest and by trending a slightly left under steep cliffs, tops out below a vertical chimney.  We found perfect plastic water ice with a couple of bulges in the chimney, the most difficult at the top.  Steep ice in the Tetons is not always such perfect plastic.\n\nThe chimney deposits one in a ramped alleyway with a wall on the left and the summit slabs of Mt.

You can begin this route either from Amphitheater Lake or from the summit of Teewinot. I recommend the former and I have not done the latter.\n\nFor the standard approach from Amphitheater Lake, descend a ramp west to the Teton Glacier Moraine (tricky if snow-covered). You now must cross the end of this glacier, which is melted out and/or covered with unstable scree. Ascend the obvious couloir to gain the saddle west of Teewinot.

Your next objective is to climb a cliff to gain access to Owen's upper snowfield, just below the summit block. The easiest option is to traverse right and climb a chimney. Now you need to make a long rising traverse left and up the upper snowfield to a point just south of the summit block. This snowfield ends in cliffs below you, so this section is deceptively dangerous. If it is melted off enough, it is usually safer to follow the rocks under the snowfield to a point where it can be climbed up directly. Practice your self-arrest before attempting this climb, or wait until it is all melted off.\n\nThe final difficulty is to climb the summit block via the big chimney on the south side, which reaches the summit ridge west of the summit.
