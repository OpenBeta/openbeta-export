First step in the ridge can either be climbed via 3rd class ramps and ledges on climbers left (east), or by climbing a short and juggy 4th class chimney just to the right (west) side of the ridge. Either way begin directly beneath the ridge proper. After this section you reach a notch in the ridge, from there follow the knife edge to the summit. A brief section near the summit involves laybacking the crest of the ridge with your feet smeared on a slab. Retrace your steps after summiting and return to the notch in the ridge line. It is easier to descend to the skiers left from here, down a southwest facing section of class 3, which brings you to the saddle between Ice and Storm Points. From here, wrap back around the west side of Ice Point to return to the Symmetry Couloir descent. For added value, wrap around the west side of Storm Point and summit via the West Face (4th class).","protection":"Approach shoes, helmet","location":"Near the base of the SW couloir of Symmetry Spire on a saddle that overlooks Cascade Canyon and Mt Owen to the west/ SW.
