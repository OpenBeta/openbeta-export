The NW Couloir on Symmetry Spire is a lesser known, but excellent route, and was first ascended by this icon of Teton climbing. Never underestimate a route first climbed in the 1930's! Climbers were tough, smart and skilled back then, just like today.\n\nThe NW Couloir of Symmetry provides is a scenic, relatively easy, and aesthetically pleasing snow and rock climb (marred only by short sections of loose rock on the upper portion of the route) which ascends from Hanging Canyon.\n\nThe snow is steep in several sections, and an uncontrolled fall from these areas could easily be fatal. The rock \"ledges,\" at the top are considered 4th class, but are exposed, and potentially deadly. Loose rock, generally easy climbing  and the wandering nature of this area discourage use of a rope, but you should plan on belaying any inexperienced climbers both on the snow and the rock. (Although it is not difficult, I do not feel this is a safe route for inexperienced climbers, or for a large party, due to rockfall potential and extensive steep snow.)\n\nWe down climbed the route.

There are a couple of excellent pitches toward the middle of the route. It’s possible to rappel back to the base (two ropes) or continue to the summit of Symmetry Spire.\n\nP1 – This pitch is kind of funky, a little bit grungy, but generally pretty good. Locate the prominent roof that is up and right of the climbing on the first pitch. Start by climbing some stacked, semi-detached flakes for thirty feet or so, eventually traversing hard left along an obvious horizontal finger crack in the flakes (this is well below the prominent roof). After bumping left, pick your way through some more 5.8 terrain, eventually ending at a ledge with a dead tree and a rappel anchor around a flake (45m).\n\nP2 – This pitch is fantastic! Start up the obvious splitter up and left of the belay ledge. Fun 5.8 climbing on clean cracks, thin hands, and crack switches left ends on another ledge with a rappel station (25m). Either belay here (top of P2 in the Gams guide) or continue into the Gams P3 (recommended). From the ledge, avoid all cracks out left, moving up and slightly right into a system of flakes and cracks on the steep face above. This is really engaging, stout 5.8 climbing, but well-protected and quite good! Belay at a good stance when the climbing eases. (50m, halfway through P3 in Gams guide).\n\nP3 – Continue straight up the “easy 5th class face” denoted on the Gams topo – it’s well featured, easy climbing moving up toward a prominent corner that looks pretty uninspiring. At this point, traverse hard right for a few feet on delicate face climbing to access a thin crack/seam out on the face (5.7ish). Follow the thin crack to some cool laybacking up corners and flakes. Eventually trend up and right to a good belay stance (roughly 55m – somewhere in the middle of P4 in Gams guide).\n\nP4 – Continue up a right-facing corner into fairly nondescript terrain above as the rock quality deteriorates significantly. Pass a ledge with a huge dead tree. There are rap slings around this tree which mark the beginning of three double rope rappels back to the base. If continuing to the summit of Symmetry Spire keep climbing through a chossy 5.7 weakness above and belay on a large ledge system.\n\nRidge scramble: From here, most parties will probably feel comfortable dropping the rope and putting the approach shoes back on. Pick your way along the path of least resistance (a lot of loose 3rd and 4th class) for approximately 30 minutes to reach the top. The Gams guide mentions climbing “good roock (5.6) above the loose stuff,” and continuing up “fun, wavy rock (5.6) to the end of the rope,” however, this path was not overly apparent.\n\nFrom near the summit, follow a climbers trail north along exposed ledges and drop into the notch at the top of the Southwest Couloir (standard descent off Symmetry). Follow this loose gully back to the base of the formation.","protection":"A few small tcus, stoppers, doubles from fingers to #1 camalot, (1)#2 and #3, alpine draws.
