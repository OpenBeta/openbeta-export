There's some excellent sections of rock, some forgettable pitches, a bit of meandering, and, generally speaking, a lot of old school charm to this 1940's alpine classic. For a fast and efficient party these 11 pitches go pretty quick, simul-climbing where rope drag isn’t an issue. After the technical terrain is complete, a lengthy (and exposed) 4th class ridge scramble leads to the summit of the Enclosure. It is a good objective for ambitious parties seeking an additional route during a two day stay at the Lower Saddle. The profile of the upper portion of this climb can be seen from the bivy sites at the Lower Saddle.\n\n*This route has a 5.9 variation to the start that appears to be quite good. For those who are interested, locate the crack system to the left of the \"orange wall\" at the base of the Southwest Ridge. This variation will intersect the original line somewhere along the large terrace on the P4 belay.\n\nFrom the initial portion of the Valhalla Traverse, scramble up 4th class slabs and 3rd class scree fields for 15 minutes or so to reach the base of the route.\n\nP1-P2. Generally speaking, following the large ramp/weakness in the prominent system on the southern side of the arete/ridge. Easier 4th class scrambling leads to a steep section of jamming on the right side of a prominent flake (5.7ish). Continue up the crack system/corner, eventually passing an old ring piton, and pull through another steep bulge on hand jams/jugs on the face (5.7ish). This section can be broken up into two pitches or combined into one lead with a little bit of simul-climbing.\n\nP3-P4. From the comfortable belay stance above the steep 5.7 bulge, avoid continuing up the easier, low angle ramp directly ahead, and quickly move left into the first prominent weakness/chimney system that accesses the ridgeline proper. This is another rope stretcher or two pitches, ending in some loose, low 5th class terrain that deposits you on a large ledge/terrace (described as P4 belay in the Ortenburger-Jackson/Gams guidebooks).\n\nThere is definitely some fuzziness in regards to the details of this lower portion of the climb; many belay options exist. Basically, pick the line of least resistance and eventually move into the first left-angling weakness that doesn't appear to be overly difficult.\n\nP5. This is a fairly short pitch. Bump the belay to the far side of the terrace, then climb the cleft/chimney in the next prominent high point in the ridge. Start up the chimney, then move left onto the face (fun 5.7ish). Belay in a notch in the disintegrating black rock cleft/gully above.\n\nP6. This is another short pitch that is hindered by rope drag, described as a \"5.4 traverse on a red rock face\" in the Gams guide. Pick your way along the path of least resistance, moving up and right along a hand traverse below a massive overhang. This pitch culminates in an awkward (and surprisingly difficult) down climb to the other side of the major break/notch in the black rock gully/notch. Be sure to protect your follower for the down climb and belay on a large ledge shortly afterwards.\n\nP7-P9. Many belay options exist for this sizable stretch of the route, but basically cruise up easy, loose 4th and low 5th class terrain, trending left toward the ridge line proper. (5.6ish). Once you encounter a large ledge on climbers left, move along the terrace and belay below a wide crack.\n\nP10-P11. Climb the 5.7 wide crack straight up the face, eventually making some awkward moves right around a small bulge/chockstone, then continue into easier terrain above (5.6ish). Belay or simul until the terrain eases at the top of the ridge line leading toward the summit of the Enclosure.\n\nP12+ Most parties will probably jettison the rope at this point, but be advised that there are many exposed sections of 4th class to reach the summit proper. It's about a 10-15 minute scramble to the top.","protection":"Single rack to #3 with some stoppers, perhaps some doubles in the .5 to #1 range.

It's first ascent represented a significant step up in American climbing, and in the ensuing years it has attained classic status. Though  Swedlund and Jaquot chopped steps through some of the upper part of the route, nevertheless, this was a bold effort and opened the door for further development on the wild side of this iconic peak. There are rock pitches in addition to approximately 1,200' of alpine ice, with a short crux of 70 degrees. (At this time MP provides only the option of rating ice on a \"Water Ice\" scale, i.e. \"WI3\". Water ice can and does occur on the BI, but it would be more accurately rated on an \"Alpine Ice\" scale.) Rock pro to the side of the ice is available, along with ice gear if one chooses to carry the latter. Many parties find comfortable pro with rock gear.  The very real rockfall danger is most serious in the lower portions of the route.\n\nConsiderable thought should be given to conditions on the upper mountain as well as temperatures at various elevations. Generally, the best conditions occur in the latter part of the summer, after the snow has consolidated or sloughed off  and freezing temperatures are observed above 11,000 feet. Both natural and manmade rockfall is possible, with parties on the Owen Spalding  directly above the route. Winter, spring, and late autumn can alternatively offer favorable conditions. In essence, any time, with the possible exception of early to mid-summer, could offer reasonable conditions,  and good alpine judgement will determine the correct course of action.\n\nEven in recent years, when reports  have indicated that the route no longer existed, it has received spring and winter ascents, underscoring the elusive nature of \"good conditions\" and the vagaries of alpine ice in the 21st century. Ask for an update from the Jenny Lake Rangers as well as local climbers, examine recent weather patterns, and then make your own call.

At that point, it's all serious terrain with considerable exposure.\n\nGetting to the aforementioned cairn is tricky, as one must cross several gullies and small ribs moving from the L.S. to the SW Ridge. A scouting mission the evening before might be in order. More detailed information on the Traverse can be found in the indispensable A Climber's Guide to the Teton Range, Ortenburger and Jackson.\n\nOnce around the NW corner, follow rotten ledges until the peak is fully visible, then aim for the base of the main icefield below the upper West Face. Ledges and short headwalls, the last one involving some awkward 5.6-7 on uncertain rock brings climbers to the start of the ice. From here, the number of pitches will vary greatly, depending upon rope length, party stamina, belay choices, and other specifics of each party. In general, expect about 8 pitches, hugging the wall of the Enclosure on the right. The route steepens with each rope length, with the short crux coming as one enters the final, most narrow portion of the route.\n\nFinally, attain the Upper Saddle and the end of the Black Ice.

However, on the 4th of July, 2018, this route was in incredible shape! We found the overall rating to be more like WI4- M4 with the crux being a chockstone-bulge on a thin WI4- slab on the second pitch.\n\nOverall, Alberich's Alley is highly recommended! Those who are interested in this variation could examine the amount of ice on the lower pitch while ascending the lower Black Ice Couloir and decide whether or not to proceed.\n\nComplete the Valhalla Traverse. Move below the Enclosure Ice Couloir, past the Emotional Rescue Buttress, then ascend the first pitch of rock (or mixed rock and ice) leading into the Black Ice Couloir. Blast up the first 600-800' of the Black Ice. At the prominent \"bowl\" feature below the West Face, trend left to a pin anchor on the wall below the prominent left \"fork\" in the steeper terrain above; the lefthand fork is Alberich's Alley. The righthand fork is the BI proper.\n\nP1- A narrow ice runnel/chute leads past a few fixed pitons to a steeper bulge of ice (WI3+). Continue up the snowy and icy weakness to an obvious chockstone. Tunnel under the chockstone then stand on top of it and set up a belay.\n\nP2 - Continue up the slab of ice covered rock above. The Ortenburger-Jackson guide states, \"Continue up and slightly left on very steep ice and rock (5.9) toward the giant jammed chockstone. Climb from under this huge boulder on thin ice...\" In 2018, this section was bomber WI3 terrain leading to a thin, cruxy section below the chockstone that protected okay with a stubby screw in stellar ice (WI4- PG-13 for about 20 feet).  Above this crux continue up ice and snow toward another obvious chockstone-tunnel. Belay at the chockstone, or if you are wondering whether you'll be able to squeeze under that thing (as we were) then trend right to a belay stance up and right of the chockstone-tunnel. This belay seemed better anyway since you don't shell your belayer with ice and snow while leading the final pitch.\n\nP3 - Traverse back left to regain the icy weakness above the chockstone. This involved a few rock climbing moves, M4ish kind of shenanigans. A mixture of ice, snow covered rock, and mixed terrain leads directly up to the flat ground of the Upper Saddle (approximately 100-200' up and left of the top out for the Black Ice Couloir). Belay at the exposed \"boulder problem/downclimb\" leading up the base of the OS rappels.\n\nFrom the Upper Saddle, continue to the summit via any number of options, or if you've had your fill, descend back to the Lower Saddle.","protection":"A handful of screws (mostly stubbies) and a single rack; possibly a few pins","location":"Approach via the Valhalla Traverse and begin on the Black Ice Couloir."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,fbebcea7-6fd9-5e4b-864e-d70705afae7e,d10b91b4-d444-525f-b255-d8c82a964877","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Grand Teton National Park","Enclosure"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"3rd"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10-"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":2,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":10,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":4,"intermediate":5,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":10,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":4,"intermediate":5,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"ice":{"total":4,"bands":{"unknown":4,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"aid":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":4,"intermediate":5,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.80585,43.74139]},"bbox":[-110.80647239471234,43.740940339818145,-110.80522760528763,43.74183966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106557065","area_id":"0QuRtNREUl+yVdjIKpZIdw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.80647239471234,43.740940339818145],[-110.80522760528763,43.740940339818145],[-110.80522760528763,43.74183966018186],[-110.80647239471234,43.74183966018186],[-110.80647239471234,43.740940339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:17.740Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:06.916Z"}
