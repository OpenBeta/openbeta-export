Top out the west summit, pass the middle one on the north, and reach the highest, east summit via a chimney just S of the low point between the middle and east summits. Reverse the route via down climbing and maybe one rappel (west of the west summit) or descend via the east ridge.","protection":"4-6 cams, plus some stoppers and slings. We did it with a 20m rope. Downclimbed the whole thing. If you wish to rappel, bring 40+m of rope.","location":"Get to saddle between Wister and Veiled one of four different ways. Fastest is via the N fork of Avalanche Canyon. South Fork also works, but involves more annoying off trail travel. Most \"fun\" could be to run up Death Canyon trail and into upper Avalanche Canyon from upper Alaska Basin. Similarly, reach Wister via predominantly trail approach via Cascade Canyon trail and the Avalanche Divide. An excellent run and scramble outing is to go up Death Canyon, Static Peak Divide and into upper Avalanche Canyon via Alaska Basin. Climb up and back on the West Ridge of Wister then up the East Ridge of Veiled Peak. Descend N face of Veiled to Snowdrift lake. Exit via Avalanche Divide and Cascade Canyon."},"__v":0},{"_id":"IkLADfnOVJ2o4rZ5V9KWFA==","name":"Northwest Couloir","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"August 26, 1968","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true,"ice":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.81674,43.70199]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"109280898","mp_crag_id":"109279385","climb_id":"IkLADfnOVJ2o4rZ5V9KWFA==","areaRef":"sXP9jmh8WS6vEUo0MM8Wwg=="},"content":{"description":"200 feet of snow to a overhang with a cave.\n\npass the overhang to the left with 5.7 moves and some aid thrown in.\n\n~700 feet of snow and sometimes ice brings you to a split in the couloir\n\nTake the narrow couloir and work right gaining the West ridge","protection":"depends on experience and comfort","location":"It's obvious, starts at the top on the talus cone.  30 min from Taminah Lake."},"__v":0},{"_id":"wYYS4msAVG+s4Owh+ttaeA==","name":"Northwest Arete","yds":"5.9","grades":{"yds":"5.9","french":"5c"},"fa":"August 30, 1966","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.81674,43.70199]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"109280696","mp_crag_id":"109279385","climb_id":"wYYS4msAVG+s4Owh+ttaeA==","areaRef":"sXP9jmh8WS6vEUo0MM8Wwg=="},"content":{"description":"An interesting climb with many options and opportunities for adventure.
