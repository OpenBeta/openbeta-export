Most of the ridge is perfect scrambling on good rock. One pitch stands out for greater difficulty and insecurity.\n\nClimb right along the crest of the mountain's East Ridge. Near the top a smooth section of the crest presents the primary difficulty. Climb edges and smears around some corners along the left edge of this slab.\n\nDescend via the Northeast Ledges (class 3). You can wrap back to the saddle, or keep going down to Snowdrift lake and various exit options.","protection":"4-6 cams, some stoppers and slings. We used a 20m rope and it was just right for the one crux pitch.","location":"Get to the Wister-Veiled saddle via either fork of Avalanche Canyon or one of many clever and similarly strenuous routes."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,fbebcea7-6fd9-5e4b-864e-d70705afae7e,393042cb-9e68-542d-a60d-8446c461f4b4,86bd49e0-f993-516a-96f3-512058a04764","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Grand Teton National Park","Avalanche Canyon","Veiled Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.82601,43.70031]},"bbox":[-110.82663196810647,43.699860339818144,-110.82538803189348,43.70075966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119607150","area_id":"hr1J4PmTUWqW81EgWKBHZA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.82663196810647,43.699860339818144],[-110.82538803189348,43.699860339818144],[-110.82538803189348,43.70075966018186],[-110.82663196810647,43.70075966018186],[-110.82663196810647,43.699860339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:18.315Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:17.962Z"}
