Â Cathedral Group, Mount Moran, Table Mountain and on a clear day, The Wind Rivers are visible from the top.\n\nA nice shorter day climb especially doable with an early boat ride across Jenny Lake.","protection":"None usually needed.  In early season (or after a healthy winter), crampons and ice axe may be prudent.\n\nSome folks may want a rope in case the route finding wasn't optimal, with some rock protection (small set of nuts, cams and slings, ect).  But, most folks easily solo this route.","location":"Hike up Hanging Canyon, past Arrowhead Pool, pass Ramshead Lake to the north side of Lake of the Crags.\n\nRight where Lake of the Crags starts to widen from its narrowest neck (sorta looks like a duck facing east...), head up the talus keeping to the climber's left as the path of least resistance.\n\nArrive at the col, and, scramble up the final east ridge some of which is fairly exposed.\n\nReverse route for the descent."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,fbebcea7-6fd9-5e4b-864e-d70705afae7e,02c35122-1542-5603-aad4-17e8d323fd46","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Grand Teton National Park","Mount St. John"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.77049,43.78208]},"bbox":[-110.7711128181613,43.78163033981814,-110.76986718183869,43.78252966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117262390","area_id":"AsNRIhVCVgOq1Bfo0yP9Rg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-110.7711128181613,43.78163033981814],[-110.76986718183869,43.78163033981814],[-110.76986718183869,43.78252966018186],[-110.7711128181613,43.78252966018186],[-110.7711128181613,43.78163033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:17.722Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:16.640Z"}
