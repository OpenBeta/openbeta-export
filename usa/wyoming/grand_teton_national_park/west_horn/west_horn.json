Follow the broad ridge above with many variations possible for three more pitches, mostly slabby climbing, with one small sub-tower before the last pitch to the top. This tower has an airy hand traverse along its top and is a distinctive feature of the climb.\n\nDescent: from the summit, clamber northward a few feet on the knife edge ridge to the obvious collection of slings. Make a single rope rap to the dark gray ledge below, about 60 feet, and easily climb up left (facing in) to the next belay station, which can be  spotted from the first rap anchor.\n\nFrom the second station make a two-rope rap down to a big talus ledge, then do one more two rope rap to the ground.\n\nThere's evidence of many other descents but this one works and avoids diagonal raps.","protection":"A small rack and lots of runners will be adequate.
