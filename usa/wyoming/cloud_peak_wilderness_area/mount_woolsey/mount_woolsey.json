The route starts out as a 3rd and 4th class scramble but almost immediately ramps up to 5th class terrain. Get the rope out when you feel it's warranted. Bypass numerous large and imposing gendarmes, sometimes on the east side, and sometimes on the west. We ended up climbing 5 roped pitches. The rock is high quality, the climbing fun, and the position and views out of this world!\n\nMore details can be found here:\n\nTrip Report","protection":"Not knowing what to expect I took a set of nuts and a set of cams 0.3 to 3 with doubles in 0.5 to 2. Experienced alpine climbers should be fine with single sets of nuts and cams. There are no fixed anchors of any sort. Bring plenty of webbing for rappel anchors as you are unlikley to find any that are usable.","location":"Reach the Woolsey - Innominate col from either the north or the south. The southern approach requires ascending a steep, loose gully with occasional 5th class moves. The northern approach was used by the first ascent party and I get the impression that it is friendlier.\n\nTo descend, either reverse the route or rappel the Northwest Buttress (two ropes recommended)."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,54266f8d-be2c-53a3-a1b1-b23b4ad0c4d2,a33b4d5a-ea63-5c7e-80aa-dcc48f250a4b","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Cloud Peak Wilderness Area","Mount Woolsey"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.5"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-107.17714,44.40102]},"bbox":[-107.17776937049096,44.40057033981814,-107.17651062950905,44.40146966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"110964144","area_id":"oztNWupjXH6AqtzEjyUKSw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:14.467Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:21.182Z"}
