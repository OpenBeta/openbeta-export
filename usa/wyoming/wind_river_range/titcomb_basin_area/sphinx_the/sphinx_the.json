It is much more alpine to approach this col from the Dinwoody Glacier side, which involves glacier travel and crossing a bergschrund.  However, I believe we gained the col from the SW (Titcomb Basin).\n\nFrom the col you are faced with a 600 foot high step.  Stay left for a pitch, then traverse right back onto the crest.  Above the step are several gendarmes that you will have to figure out how to get past.  Be sure to yodel to startle the parties crossing the glacier below on their way to Gannett Peak.\n\nThis route looks really cool from below but if you are expecting another Wolf's Head think again.  The ridge is not as knife-like and the rock is not as solid, but the position is great.\n\nFrom the summit, descend the NW Ridge (5.1), which may involve a rappel.  You can then descend either to the Dinwoody Glacier side or to Titcomb Basin.  However, decending north may require jumping a bergschrund (rather memorable on the FA).","protection":"Light rack.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"n/pxewH3Vo2baMjc5EXUIg==","name":"Northwest Ridge","yds":"4th","grades":{"yds":"4th","french":"1"},"fa":"Henderson, Underhill 1929","type":{"trad":true,"snow":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.64813,43.16546]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"119104298","mp_crag_id":"105927284","climb_id":"n/pxewH3Vo2baMjc5EXUIg==","areaRef":"vlZ9pe2xUOystI06IUjnjg=="},"content":{"description":"The standard descent for technical climbs on the Sphinx, or a peakbagger's scramble to the summit.\n\nReach the Sphinx-Wilson col by easy snow from the Sphinx Glacier (Titcomb) or by moderately steep snow from the Dinwoody Glacier (a large bergschrund may be difficult late-season).\n\nThe ridge is about 300 feet of mixed 4th-class blocks, easier spots, and maybe some easy snow depending on the season.","protection":"There were a few rap stations, but downclimbing the route seems to be standard practice.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,c063bf50-7fe2-5095-952d-b5bada740542,dc575039-13e7-564d-9534-1db12ec0c183,be567da5-edb1-50ec-acb4-8d3a2148e78e","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Wind River Range","Titcomb Basin Area","Sphinx, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"4th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.64813,43.16546]},"bbox":[-109.64874649546682,43.165010339818146,-109.64751350453317,43.16590966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105927284","area_id":"vlZ9pe2xUOystI06IUjnjg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:19.346Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:25:29.531Z"}
