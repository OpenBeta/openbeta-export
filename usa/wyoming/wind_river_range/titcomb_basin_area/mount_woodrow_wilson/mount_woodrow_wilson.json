Near the base of the peak, you will have to cross a small glacier, the Sphinx Glacier, with a problematic moraine to cross.\n\nThe inset couloir is in the center of the face and obvious once you are close.  This couloir is generally snow-filled until July and you can see the snow from Titcomb Basin.  If it has melted out do not climb this route (move around to the west to the west couloir).\n\nSnap on your crampons and head straight up the narrow couloir.  It is not as long as you might think, soon you'll reach a notch in the summit ridge.  From here, a 5.1 pitch leads to the top, or you can solo up and down this section (I would rate it 4th class).","protection":"Crampons and ice axe.
