Rope drag can be a pain as the first couple of pitches wind through various ledge systems until you reach double finger cracks about half way up. The line becomes more obvious and direct from here on out.\n\nMind the loose rocks and the vegetation. There's a real falling rock hazard to the belayer beneath the chimney sections. The belay requires a helmet. Keep your attachment point long enough you can steer clear of falling debris.\n\nThe whole thing can be done in 3 and a half pitches with two 60 meter ropes, running near full length.\n\nDescent: Scramble down the westernmost south gully(4th class).","protection":"Bring a standard rack including nuts and camming units from small fingers to fists. I found myself wishing I had a double set of medium nuts. Bring plenty of slings/runners as the rope friction on the early pitches can be a drag.","location":"This route starts maybe 100 feet to the right of the Northwest Buttress. Aim for the diagonal chimney to the right of the arete. The good stuff starts after a pitch or two of 5.6 climbing/ scrambling up to some finger cracks set about 8-10 inches apart at the base, splitting up to 4 feet at the next obvious belay. Continue to a nice belay beneath the chimney roof. Ride the chimney to the top."},"__v":0},{"_id":"vxx8XOnkV3iSI/byulnTCA==","name":"Northwest Buttress","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Bill Buckingham and Art Davidson, 1962.","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.638,43.1202]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"106077400","mp_crag_id":"106077392","climb_id":"vxx8XOnkV3iSI/byulnTCA==","areaRef":"3kCVgzRpWOaO9PdvJw2I0w=="},"content":{"description":"The route up the Northwest Buttress is the type of climb where no two parties choose the same path.

Bring a 60 meter rope for long pitches - there are lots of ledges to choose from.
