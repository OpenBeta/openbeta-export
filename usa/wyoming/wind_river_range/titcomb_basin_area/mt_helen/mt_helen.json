Helen from Titcomb Basin, the Tower Ridge starts by ascending the gentler ridge on the right side of the steep West Face.  This involves about 1,000' of climbing, with lots of 5.7 sections in the middle and some 4th class to easy 5th in the beginning and near the top of Tower 1.  Pass Tower 2 on the right (to the south).  Pass Tower 3 to the left (north) and climb a short section of steep, exposed easy 5th class rock (which often holds snow/ice) to get to the knife-edge saddle between Tower 3 and the summit of Mt. Helen.  The summit ridge provides another 500' of entertainment, including the crux climbing.\n\nThe entire climb is on excellent rock.","protection":"Set of nuts, set of cams from fingers to hands, 2 - 60 meter ropes, lots of runners.  No bolts here.","location":"The technical climbing starts a few hundred feet above the base of the ridge, on a prominent large ledge below slabs.  Access this ledge from the steep talus gully (or snow early season) immediately south of the ridge.\n\nDescent\n\noptions are many.  Frequently, parties will make a shorter outing of the climb by descending from the summit of Tower 1 instead of continuing to the top of Helen.  The mountain is a complex collection of spires, towers, ridges, gullies, ice couloirs, and talus fields.  Invest some time in scouting out your options for descent."},"__v":0},{"_id":"cUVVswgxVSCfXxTwAft+ng==","name":"Tower 1 - West Face Center","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Fred Beckey, Bill Lahr, and Craig Martinson - 1976","type":{"trad":true,"aid":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.638,43.1202]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"121229223","mp_crag_id":"105879394","climb_id":"cUVVswgxVSCfXxTwAft+ng==","areaRef":"yNNX5kI9Xd2mcj+83dzEuQ=="},"content":{"description":"Overhangs near the top of upper corner system are probably the crux of this route. A mixed pitch of free and aid. The rock is quite solid on this part of the wall. The description remains the same, regardless of which edition of Kelsey's guide you have. We found the route easy to follow. Rainsford Rouner, Gustavo Brillembourg and I did this wall in a casual 2 days in August 1985 during a really long spell of fine weather. The wall gets a bit slabby as you approach the bivy ledges which are quite roomy. The upper half of the route is more sustained. From the top we downclimbed and did several raps on the South Ridge.","protection":"Nut, wires and Friends.

The route starts just right of the bottom of NW Face Right Gully/Tower 1 gully, then continues right up the crest. The upper section is beautiful and exposed. We simul-climbed the lower-angled bottom half, then pitched out the crest. Very cool, should be climbed more!
