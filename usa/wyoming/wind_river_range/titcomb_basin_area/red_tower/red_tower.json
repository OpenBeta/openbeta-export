Start on the hand crack that travels up and left. From here follow obvious crack systems that basically head straight up.\n\nBelay at ledges with gear anchors.\n\nThe last pitch ( crux ) heads right off the belay into a left facing thin corner and finishes on steep jugs.\n\nDecent: Down climb the south face to a ledge with a single pin. Repel off with 2 ropes. A bit more down climbing to a drainage.\n\nThere is a slung chock stone in the top of the drainage. I would imagine this tat is no longer trustworthy. Bring extra webbing or you can scramble across the base of the tower finishing with a bit more down climbing to the base of the route.","protection":"doubles from small to hands & stoppers\n\nlong runners.","location":"see topo"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,c063bf50-7fe2-5095-952d-b5bada740542,dc575039-13e7-564d-9534-1db12ec0c183,9de224e0-6ca4-5101-879f-43ef1ab2fd34","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Wind River Range","Titcomb Basin Area","Red Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.62306,43.12308]},"bbox":[-109.62367606823298,43.12263033981815,-109.62244393176701,43.12352966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112390576","area_id":"neIk4GykUQGHn0PvGrL9NA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.62367606823298,43.12263033981815],[-109.62244393176701,43.12263033981815],[-109.62244393176701,43.12352966018187],[-109.62367606823298,43.12352966018187],[-109.62367606823298,43.12263033981815]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:19.346Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:09.126Z"}
