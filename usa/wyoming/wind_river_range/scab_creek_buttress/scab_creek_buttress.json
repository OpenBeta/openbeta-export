Starts with a short and steep splitter hand crack, then a slab traverse to the right, protected by a single bolt, over to a flake. Follow the flake up to a nice belay ledge with 2 bolted anchors. From the anchors, keep following the flake up through a small roof, which I would say is the crux. After the roof, the flake goes for some more before ending in another slab section, with protection right where you need it, and then up some steeper, but easier climbing to a huge ledge. There is a 2 bolt anchor at this ledge, and you can double rope rap down, or single rope rap to previous anchors, or walk off following the ledge to climbers left, or keep going up one of the routes up to the top. Route can be done in one pitch with good rope management.","protection":"A single rack to 3\" and a set of stoppers will suffice. Both anchors have rap rings. Only bolt is the one on the slab traverse section.","location":"Route is the next one to the right (East) of the start for Photo Finish and Black Book.
