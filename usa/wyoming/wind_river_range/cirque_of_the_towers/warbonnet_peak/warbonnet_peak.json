So naturally, we decided to investigate...\n\nApproach as for Black Elk from the boulder field.  As you walk along the base of the blocky ledges below the main face, keep an eye out for an obvious grassy/sandy 3rd and 4th class gully leading up and right.  Scramble this gully to its end.  Pitch 1 begins at the top of the gully below the obvious curving roof of pitch 2.\n\nPitch 1: Climb the low angle face and flakes to a corner that leads to a ledge below the curving R-facing corner.  5.9+, 140'\n\nPitch 2: Climb the corner and roof past an ancient fixed pin.  Leaving the roof, follow an excellent finger crack that leads up and right to a ramp and grassy ledge.  5.10, 190'\n\nPitch 3: Climb straight up from the right side of the grassy ledge following seams that connect two roofs.  Head left out the upper roof.  Move past a slot to gain a right angling ramp and crack system. Belay off the ramp to avoid an uncomfortable belay. 5.10+, 90'\n\nPitch 4: Head up to the next roof.  Work your way out and left, and pull the lip to a balancy tips crack in a corner. Take the corner until it intersects a right trending ramp.  Bypass the ramp by making an airy move left  into the next left facing corner system.  Take this second corner system to a grassy ledge.  5.11-, 110'\n\nPitch 5: Take the blocky corner on the right through 5.8 terrain that leads to a hand crack.  Follow the hand crack up and then trend left, aiming for a grassy alcove below the upper-left of two parallel, right angling crack systems.  5.8, 160'\n\nPitch 6: Climb a thin flake/seam and then pull left into the fantastic hands and finger corner. Follow the crack system for 100' to a large ledge.  5.10, 110'\n\nPitch 7: Step left from the belay around a corner and wide ramp towards a steep chimney/slot. Traverse in (sweet!) and stem, jam, and thrutch your way up to the bottom of an innocuous looking overhanging handcrack. Pull the bulge and scramble up and left to belay below a gorgeous white R-facing corner. 5.10+, 160'\n\nPitch 8: Fire the steep, thin, white corner for 60'. Above the corner head up easier ground to belay on 4th class ledges. 5.11, 190'\n\nFrom the top of pitch 8, scramble fun 4th class terrain to the summit.\n\nAlternate Finish: From the top of pitch 8, skip the summit for now and scramble/downclimb the large loose gully behind the top-out of Who's On First. Aim for a chimney system at the base of a prominent semi-independent tower with a large curving off-width up the face. Scramble the chimney and then step up into a spectacular splitter hand crack to corner. Giggle for 200' as you climb one of the most fun 5.9 pitches you'll ever climb in the mountains. From the ledge on top, climb to the airy tower summit (f'ing cool) and then climb one more pitch along the crest to regain the main summit ridge of Warbonnet.\n\nSide note: We found evidence of a previous ascent on pitch 1 and up to the curving roof on pitch 2 (fixed pin), but did not find any sign of passage above the curving roof.  If anyone has information of previous passage on or near this route, please leave a comment so we can properly credit those before us.","protection":"Doubles #.2 to #3, 1.5 sets of nuts (offsets handy)","location":"Far right end of the SE face where the main wall wraps around towards Arrowhead Lake."},"__v":0},{"_id":"wThw9T4NWjuwulxj57PqYg==","name":"Weather Or Not...","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"Nathan Brown, Jonathan Foster","type":{"trad":true,"alpine":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.216,42.76202]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107270155","mp_crag_id":"105879406","climb_id":"wThw9T4NWjuwulxj57PqYg==","areaRef":"OJEVnEzzVvec9emFTDghVw=="},"content":{"description":"After finding that a couple of the other lines that we'd been eyeing had already been done, or at least partially, we settled on this one...  and it turned out to be quite an excellent route!  It doesn't climb the main section of Warbonnet, but it's nearly as long as the routes that do because of the lack of required 3rd/4th class scrambling at the start.  Pitch 3 and 5 are as good as any similar style pitch that I've encountered on my fairly limited ascents of El Cap.  I would highly recommend this route!\n\nP-1  This pitch is not the highest quality, but it's not too bad either.  It's the only logical way to gain the wall above.  Climb up some flake systems interspersed with a short face section to a belay below the prominent orange colored short left angling corner.  5.9 ~ 180'\n\nP-2 Climb the left facing/angling hand & fist crack to a short double crack system.  Follow the right one to a ledge and belay.  5.10 ~ 80'\n\nP-3  Climb past flakes and into a fantastic left facing corner (\"Drop Of A Hat\" diverts left here).  The majority of this pitch is wide and requires at least one #5 camelot size piece to protect (if you walk it along like I did).  The last portion of the corner is not OW and protects with a normal rack.  Good face holds will appear at just the right time...  Belay on sloping ledge.  5.10 ~ 90'\n\nP-4 Climb out right onto boulder and continue up the easy corner to a nice flat ledge in the large corner system.  5.8 ~ 60'\n\nP-5  This is an excellent and exciting pitch!  Climb out left onto the double crack/flake system that splits the headwall.  The flakes are a bit hollow sounding in spots but protect fairly well.  Belay on a small flat ledge. I would have had a perfect onsight of this pitch but I opted to clip into a piece in an attempt to pull off a loose flake.  5.10 ~ 120'\n\nNote:  It is also possible to bail off right at the start of the crux section; this is what we did the first time up due to the scary flake that I couldn't remove.  This variation follows a seam and ends up in the large corner system on another route.  Don't go this way if you wanna continue the route.\n\nP-6.  Climb the excellent groove/dihedral to easier ground and a belay in the grungy ramp (that leads to top) at the rap bolts.  5.8+ ~ 190'\n\nFinish up the chossy ramp system that leads to the  \"top\" and the standard descent or take the new rap route listed below (better option).\n\nEdit:  We developed a rap route down this thing in Aug '12, making it a great half day outing. However, be advised that the rap route does not follow the lower portion of the climb, only the top 2 pitches - see photo.\n\nFrom top, rap from bolts to top of P-5 and 3 stainless stoppers.

Stay low when you have the option. The route finding for the very beginning of the roped climbing was a bit difficult. I actually tried climbing up too early in the ledge traverse and got completely hosed on some unprotected 5.11 slab that I had to retreat from.

We had to simulclimb a bit to set up a proper belay.\n\nP2 Climb the pretty right facing corner passing some small overlaps on fingers and hands and lay backing.
