To get on the ridge there are 2 different options.  IMO the easiest way to gain the ridge is to scramble 4th and 5th class up the gully in between Pingora and Tiger Tower. Summit Tiger Tower, then do two, 40ft raps on to the east ridge of Wolfs Head (see picture on wolfs head page).  The other way, is to scramble 3rd and 4th class up the south face then up to the ridge.\n\nOnce on the Ridge the climb goes at about 10 pitches but many of these can be combined or simul-climbed.  The description below is what worked for us.\n\n1.)  Start by moving west along the ridge aiming for a 30ft slab that's about 3ft wide with a 30 degree slope. Scamper across this beautifully exposed bridge (5.2), then run the rope out for 195ft until you find a belay.  (mostly exposed 4th class)\n\n2.)  From here its roughly 3 pitches of easy 3rd and 4th class climbing along the ridge.  This can be easily simul-climbed and highly recommended.  End at a ledge 10ft down to the south (left) of the ridge, just before the first tower.\n\n3.) This is the first of the tower pitches.  Pass this tower to the south by making a exposed step around a boulder.  After this look up and you will see a chimney in between the towers, go through this chimney (tight squeeze) to gain a ledge on the north side of the next tower.  You can belay here, but I recommend to keep climbing to link this pitch with the \"piton pitch\".  Follow 4 or 5 pitons for some delicate exposed face climbing (5.6).  After the last piton go straight up and belay on the nice ledge.\n\n4.) The best pitch of the climb.  From the belay move straight up the layback flake for 20ft.  Once on top, go up a finger crack for 10 feet to gain a beautiful hand crack traverse 5.6(still on the north).  After the traverse move up to the top of the knife blade ridge for some beautifully exposed climbing.  At this point you should be eye level with the \"Darth Vader Tower\".  Belay in an overhang on the south side of the ridge under the tower.\n\n5.) From the belay move out on to the south face to traverse a 4in crack.  Going feet in the crack is easier but hard to protect.  You will see a chimney down left, your aiming for this.  Follow a slanting hand traverse using \"black nubbins\" to gain the chimney.  Climb the chimney until you see a hole that you can dive through to bring you back to the north side of the ridge.  Belay on a ledge on the north side of the ridge.\n\n6.) From here you can simul-climb to the summit staying mainly on the north side of the ridge. (mostly 4th and 5th class)\n\nDescent:  There are many ways to descend, the goal is to rap to the west until you can hike south to the gully in between Wolfs Head and Overhanging tower.  All the raps can be done with one 60m.\n\nAll stations contain at least 3 slings.  If your rapping off something with less, you may be off route.\n\n1.)  Find the slings on the West side of the summit, rap down 80ft to a ledge.\n\n2.)  Walk 10ft to the west to find another group of slings in a boulder alcove.  Rap 70ft to a ledge.\n\n3.)  Walk to the south west along a climbers trail to locate the next set of slings on your right.  Rap another 90ft to a ledge.\n\n4.)  Carefully scramble down the trail to the next set of slings.  Rap another 95ft to a ledge.\n\n5.)  If my count is right, here you will walk along a trail for about 400yds to the south toward Overhanging tower.  Do another 90ft rap to the saddle in between Wolfs head and Overhanging tower.\n\n6.)  Follow the cairns for a while still heading south.  Eventually this takes you to a station that will allow you to rap into the gully formed by the saddle.  It looks like it should be a double rope rap, but one 60m will be fine.  After rapping scramble up the gully to the east bringing you back into the cirque lake basin.\n\nThere are many options, and this may sound confusing, but the trails are well worn and marked with cairns, and all the stations were very easy to find.","protection":"Standard alpine rack.  Doubles of everything to #2 camalot.  A single #3 is very useful and recomended.  1 60m will suffice, but being an alpine climb having 2 ropes will make it much faster to bail in event of a storm.

Long pitches and clean corners make up the majority of this fantastic route. Route finding becomes very easy after you have climbed the first couple of pitches. Generally just keep climbing the corners towards the really big roof.\n\nGrades are approximate, We did the route in 5 pitches with a 60 and some simul-climbing skipping the first pitch due to snow cover. As such some of the climbing was really draggy and hard to put a grade on. If I were to do the route again I'd stop at the belays described, avoiding all weird intermediate hanging belays. P4 & P5 may link with a 70m and a lot of drag, P7 & P8 will link with a 60m rope.\n\nP1: Locate a right facing corner low on the Wolf's Head. This pitch was still entirely under the snow when we got to it, so we scrambled above it to start the route. My understanding is that this pitch is well protected and not harder than 5.8.\n\nP2: a long pitch up a slightly ledge-y right facing corner system to a ledge with a black band of broken rock going through it. 5.8/5.9?\n\nP3: Go up from the belay skirting a roof feature on its right side.

According to the Bechtel guide, the route was previewed on rappel before leading. In its current state, about half the route consists of crumbling kitty litter, while half is bullet granite. I suspect with more traffic, this will clean up into a 3 or 4 star area classic! We did the route during an extended stretch of high pressure in August, and still had to negotiate several sections of wet rock (including the crux moves), so I suspect the route is almost always wet it places...probably best to get on this one late in the season (August).\n\nP1: Begin as for the Becky route, at a black horizontal dike. When possible traverse right onto wandering crumbly slabs with sporadic gear. Find your way into the base of the obvious 400ft rightward angling corner and belay on a slab about 15ft below using 1-2 inch gear (5.8/5.9 150ft).\n\nP2: Negotiate a couple dangerous loose blocks to gain the corner. Layback and jam up the corner, involving insecure footwork with thin but good pro. This pitch is rather crumbly and wet...I pulled off lots of loose flakes, and most of the feet crumbled away when I moved off of them...this pitch will become cleaner, and perhaps a bit harder, as it sees more traffic. There are a couple spooky blocks that should be avoided or trundled. Belay at a small ledge with good gear options (5.10ish, 170ft-ish). We had to break this pitch into 2 because we only had singles of TCU's and nuts, however it can easily be done ledge to ledge with doubles in the smaller sizes.\n\nP3&4: The next 200-250ft features spectacular corner climbing on perfect clean granite (5.11a)! Layback and jam with mostly smears for feet, while the corner progressively angles harder and harder to the right. The climbing is sustained and classic. A couple of very wet mandatory hand jams made things a bit more interesting. We used a hanging belay in the middle of the pitch since we only had a light rack, however, strong parties might be able to put together an epic rope stretcher! The final 30ft-ish of the pitch traverses straight right on underclings, and the rock quality deteriorates a bit. The corner ends at bush and some black rock, where a belay can be had. From this point, I believe we ended up \"off route\", so I will describe what we did, and where I believe the route was supposed to go.\n\nP5 (What we did): From the bush, I climbed straight up a clean flared corner with tenuous gear placement (5.10). At the end of the corner, one can either hand traverse left or right 20ft. We went right at around 5.9-ish. Whichever way you go, continue up to a ledge system with no gear, and return to some big flakes above and slightly left of the flared corner. From here, I climbed a dirty left facing corner, pulling mostly on grass tufts (5.9), up to a flake with good hand and fist sized gear. From here, hand traverse right (5.10) to a ledge, and then climb a short OW to a short thin hand crack leading to the ridge crest (5.9). (150ft, 5.10)\n\nP5 Alternative?: About 20ft down and right from the bush at the end of the corner, I noticed what appeared to be a two bolt belay. I saw it from above after the hand traverse, and it was invisible (around a corner) from the bush belay. If it is a solid bolted belay, one could feasibly downclimb to it from the end of the corner, and then traverse right out of the belay into a better corner system on the right which appeared to lead to the ridge-crest as well.\n\nDescent: From the ridge, one can either continue to the summit on the East Ridge (recommended), or descend the sidewalk section via down-leading to the class 3 ledges and back to camp. Apparently, one can also rappel the Becky Route which tops out to the north, although we did not investigate this option.","protection":"Standard Rack to two #3 BD cams (no #4 needed). If you're hoping to do long pitches I would recommend doubles in the c3/tcu sizes and triples from 0.4 to #1 BD cams. No brassy's necessary. Also, WEAR LONG PANTS until the feet clean up a bit.\n\nBecause of the substantial lateral movement on this climb, bailing would be complicated. I would recommend two ropes and webbing in order to avoid leaving your whole rack behind if something does go wrong.
