It is more difficult than the class 4 (or 5?) gully below the notch between Pingora and Tiger Tower, which is just to the climber's right of South Gully.\n\nPitch 1 (5.4): Climb 185' up the gully to a big, comfortable ledge on climber's left of the gully. Mostly class 4 with a few easy class 5 moves.\n\nPitch 2 (5.5): Continue 185' up the gully and belay below a series of steep flakes. Mostly class 2-4 with several short and easy class 5 sections.\n\nPitch 3 (5.6): Climb 100' up the left side of steep flakes (moderate class 5) and continue up easier terrain (class 2-4) to the ridge just above the notch between Pingora and Tiger Tower.\n\nPitch 4 (5.0): Simulclimb or free solo 250' to the summit. Mostly class 3-4 with a few easy class 5 moves.\n\nDescent to valley south of Wolf's Head: Downclimb class 4 (or 5?) gully between Pingora and Tiger Tower.\n\nDescent to East Ridge of Wolf's Head: Downclimb 30' of exposed class 4 and rappel twice (both only 25') off natural anchors. Climb a short 5.0 section and continue 250' of class 4 along the ridge to the saddle between Tiger Tower and Wolf's Head.","protection":"A set of cams unless you feel comfortable free soloing exposed 5.6.","location":"This route ascends the gully that starts climber's left (west) of the gully between Pingora and Tiger Tower."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,c063bf50-7fe2-5095-952d-b5bada740542,c12ff925-ca28-53af-a0f5-105c6dcec1b9,1625366b-ed15-5019-9f2c-124d769f018e","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Wind River Range","Cirque of the Towers","Tiger Tower"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.2274,42.77899]},"bbox":[-109.22801263361097,42.77854033981814,-109.22678736638906,42.77943966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112140529","area_id":"FiU2a+0VUBmfLBJNdp8Bjg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-109.22801263361097,42.77854033981814],[-109.22678736638906,42.77854033981814],[-109.22678736638906,42.77943966018187],[-109.22801263361097,42.77943966018187],[-109.22801263361097,42.77854033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:22.226Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:43:15.759Z"}
