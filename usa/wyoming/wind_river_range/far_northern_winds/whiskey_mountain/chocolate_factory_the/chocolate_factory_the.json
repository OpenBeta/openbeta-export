Start by climbing up onto a small ledge to the right of the crack, then use a combination of offwidth jamming and stemming to climb up inside the arch. Continue  through chimneys above the offwidth and gain a big ledge. Continue to tunnel up and right through caverns inside the rock until you reach a large sloping platform with walls on two sides and a dramatic roof. Belay here.\n\nPitch 2 (C2)\n\nClimb or aid up to the horizontal crack below the nearly horizontal 15-foot roof. Tension traverse out below the roof to place the biggest cam you have (at least a #4). Aid out the ever-narrowing crack in the roof. There is a fixed ballnut from my FA at the corner where the roof turns up. A few tenuous placements with moderate decking potential above the ledge lead around the corner of the roof to the belay. My partner thought this pitch was reminiscent of the classic climbs \"Separate Realities\" and \"Trench Warfare;\" it\n\nmight\n\ngo free at 5.hard. After topping out, eat some chocolate and soak in the splendor of the views.","protection":"Cams .3-4 with doubles .5-3\n\nA few micro cams\n\nRPs or micro nuts\n\nBallnuts (optional, recommended)","location":"​​​​​​​​Find Whiskey Mountain Pinnacle (obvious from the meadow at the end of the trail) and walk west to the next rocks.
