Start aiding this crack, then make some loose free moves through the white band. Beware loose blocks in this section. From a large ledge, aid a right-slanting, extremely thin crack through the molasses-colored face, then aid the wider, drastically left-angling crack below a roof. You will pass a fixed #1 BD cam here.
