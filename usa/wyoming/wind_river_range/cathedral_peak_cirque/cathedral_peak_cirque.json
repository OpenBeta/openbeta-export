The upper corner is totally the highlight of the route, starts with cool face climbing, then pumpy lie-backing and right as you start to think that there is no possible way that it will go you reach out right and find a rad glory jug. The rock gets a little bit kitty littery on ethier side of the dihedral but is good where it matters. The belays for every pitch have good stances. The slab start is a bit spooky but can be avoided by starting more left at the right-leaning crack that leads to the base of the dihedral.","protection":".2 to 4, doubles of .3 to 3","location":"On the NorWest side of Middle Lake.
