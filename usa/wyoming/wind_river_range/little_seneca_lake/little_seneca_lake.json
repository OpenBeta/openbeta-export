The crux is the committing move to get off the ground with no pro, followed by a series of strenuous gear placements. Following the first move the gear is plentiful if you can find a free hand to place it. Easy walk off via climber's left or rappel off of trees above the route.","protection":"C3's along with C4's up to #2.","location":"Located on the north side of Little Seneca Lake approximately 20 yards from the lake shore.
