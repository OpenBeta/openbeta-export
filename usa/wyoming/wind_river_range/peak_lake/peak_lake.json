Soloed this route in August 1982. The lower snow/ice in the couloir was straightforward. Found a small ledge to switch to rock shoes and continued upward. Several pitches of reasonable climbing (self belayed) to the base of the upper chimney. That's when the TS arrived. Not inclined to be in the chimneys in the rain, I detoured left for a bit and then did a couple pitches of moderate climbing to the summit.","protection":"Didn't see any fixed gear.","location":"Cutthroat Spire looks to be taller, but once you get past it, the gully and corner system on the main north face come into view.
