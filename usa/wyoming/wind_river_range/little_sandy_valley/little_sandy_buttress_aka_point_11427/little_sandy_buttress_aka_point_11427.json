This should not be any harder than 5.7. Once on the middle section, scramble up and right to the rightmost crack system on the face. From the base of the crack system, face climb left to the next crack system, follow a nice hand crack for 25 feet or so to a ledge that leads back to the right hand crack system. Follow this crack for a couple of pitches at 5.9 to the ridge. Right before the ridge, you will have to negotiate a steep bush-filled off-width followed by a left-leaning undercling/roofy system. 2 more pitches of easier climbing up the ridge lead to the summit.","protection":"Standard Rack to #4 Camalot.","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,c063bf50-7fe2-5095-952d-b5bada740542,51c02fe6-dacd-52e6-9983-1f072a9af6d5,a6ca509e-bac8-5cdc-8df5-e37e9b080670","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Wind River Range","Little Sandy Valley","Little Sandy Buttress (aka Point 11,427)"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-109.204,42.7551]},"bbox":[-109.20461239738627,42.75465033981814,-109.2033876026137,42.75554966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109258200","area_id":"pspQnrrIXNyN9eN+mwgGcA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:22.222Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:33.781Z"}
