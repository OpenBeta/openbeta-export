Start by climbing a finger crack through a bulge, and follow this as it widens all the way to slightly larger than fists at the very end.  There is good patina all around the crack to help with the tough sizes.  There is a bolt anchor on top that will likely need some extending if you wish to lower off the climb.  If you don't lower, then belay from the top and rap into the corridor.","protection":"Friends .5 through #4, and optionally a #5 for the offwidth finish, though the climbing eases up there so if you don't mind running it out just a bit you can skip the big piece.

The climbing is a cool mix of jamming and liebacking with your feet in the crack most of the way.  When the crack runs out at the top, exit on perfect patina.  This is one of the nicest hard cracks I have seen anywhere.  This should be on everyone's hard ticklist for Vedauwoo, though it will be especially appealing for those looking to make the transition from hard sport climbing to hard crack climbing.","protection":"Small brass nuts up through a #1.75 Friend.  I used a small non-production, hybrid Zero (Z3/Z4) that was crucial for the top piece, though an equivalent hybrid Alien (black/blue) or C3 would also likely work.
