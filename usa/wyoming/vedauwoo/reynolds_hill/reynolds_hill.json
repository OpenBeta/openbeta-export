I am not completely sure that this is an FA and would love to hear some feedback.  It is a sustained, overhanging #3 to #4 Camalot crack for the first 40', then you get to a pod and the crack arcs right and pinches down to very flared, thin hands and fingers.  I know Vedauwoo very well and I have never heard of this or seen any pictures, but it is very worthy.  I won't lie, the rock quality is good in the fist crack section, but once you hit the pod and the finger crack starts the rock becomes very grainy, sharp and crystally.  I think with a few more ascents it will clean up a lot.  One reason I believe it to be an FA is the amount of cleaning I did.  This is a good hard Vedauwoo route that should get good with some action.  Get on it and let me know what you think.","protection":"Mainly #3-old #4 Camalots with a fingers piece or two for the end.\n\nThis climb now has a fixed anchor for cleaning and toproping.

Go up a slot between two boulders with a dead tree on the ground on the left side and Bloodletting will be right in front of you.
