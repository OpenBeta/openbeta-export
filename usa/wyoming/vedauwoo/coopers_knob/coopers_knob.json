Using the arete and fin, make your way to the top, which also is a laser-cut edge and jug.  Very aesthetic, and it would be awesome to eliminate the arete.","protection":"Pad.  The landing is pretty flat, too.  Downclimb the left side of this block, it's not bad.","location":"Again, stay on the high point of the ridge of rock leading to the summit of this hill-peak.  As you're hiking up this will be smiling at you.

I suppose it's more of a solo if bouldered.  The rock is beautiful and starts as a hand crack.  It thins to off-set splitter fingers, briefly just before the top, but you have great feet and can use an intersecting horizontal.","protection":"None.  If a rope is used, hand to finger sized pro.  You'll have to build an anchor too.  Since you scramble down to the base of this thing, you top out back on the ridge, so there's no real descent off the route.","location":"The hill-peak itself heightens as a spine of rock.  As you're hiking up, and when the rock starts to get good, follow the natural ridge of stone up the peak and this will be jutting out, to uphill-hiker's left.
