Scramble up a varied and low angle crack (hands to OW) that cuts up and then left following a left-facing corner - 5.3ish.  Move around a crumbly boulder on its left, then walk about 100 feet to your right up the ramp until your rope runs out a the base of a huge cove/chimney.  Extend your pro on this or rope drag will get bad.\n\nPitch 2. head up the cove/chimney thinking 3-dimensionally as there are huge holds and ledges all around you.  Use the large flake if you dare for good hand jams (5.4).  Exit the chimney onto boulders, and climb the flakes and slab on your right to gain the top, or, stay in the chimney as it tightens and OW it to the top (more 5.7ish).  Belay in the big crack at your feet or the vertical one leading to the tip top.\n\nThere are metal bars that were hammered into the flakes on the slab.  They look old, and they are loose.  Sling at your own risk.  I [used] one as a quick rap from the top but wouldn't recommend it as I got the rope stuck and had to free it and downclimb anyway.\n\nDecent: downclimb the easy slab and scramble down the bulgy ramp on the rock's East side. If you want to leave gear, you can rap off the top on either side as well, just don't do it on the west side as this will land you on private property.","protection":"Set of nuts, BD C4s to 1 each #0.75-5.
