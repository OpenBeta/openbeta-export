This is a great crack in its own right, and it serves as an excellent warm up if your headed up to\n\nHypertension\n\n. Running laps on this thing is a favorite pastime by many people who know about it. Respect the vegetation about the base. You are right in the middle of the Central Area, so there are some lovely views all around you.","protection":"Skill.  You probably wouldn't want to fall off the top, but thats not too likely to happen, it just gets easier and easier as you go up.","location":"As you approach for Land of the Rising Moon, while still at ground level, you will walk across a red wooden bridge over the little invariably dry drainage.  Right after crossing the bridge, head up to the obvious big boulders about 50 to 100 feet away that are on the right (north) side of the drainage.

Rock here is smoother than most of Vedauwoo, there are no real crystals poking out.  One of the best lines anywhere, Scarpelli and Suzuki used to run laps on this thing all the time as it was maybe their favorite crack at Vedauwoo.  The bottom stays dry in a light rain, and there is a nest of stoppers right after the crux, so you can huck laps on the bottom section.  This is a must do for visiting hardpeople.
