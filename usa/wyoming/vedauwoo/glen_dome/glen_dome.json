It climbs a slightly left-leaning crack (nuts useful) past a small roof (made 5.4 by face holds) to a long slopey ledge.  Either topout the formation via a variety of options (a small chimney/offwidth seemed to be the most interesting option) and belay from a big horizontal, or belay from a large ledge and walkoff right.","protection":"A standard rack.  Could be done with just a set of hexes.  Long slings very useful, as the route jags back right after the roof.","location":"From the nature trail, look for a big horizontal with a left leaning crack above it.  The walkoff goes up and over Glen Dome, towards Land of the Rising Moon."},"__v":0},{"_id":"MjNGmThnWzaZMDrs8hKlLw==","name":"Chalking Nervously","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Brian Scoggins, Rob Phares, October 19, 2008","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"X","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.3769,41.1651]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106281588","mp_crag_id":"106267131","climb_id":"MjNGmThnWzaZMDrs8hKlLw==","areaRef":"0ipDcLWSWjmplf58/GgrSw=="},"content":{"description":"Ascend a flared seam (reminiscent of\n\n5.11 Crack\n\n, although lower angle) to a good horizontal crack (reminiscent of Bad Saturday) and set a few good pieces.  Traverse along the horizontal to a good, basketball-sized cobble, mantle up, and run it out up a steadily steepening face to a good-sized ledge at the base of a chimney/offwidth.  You are in groundfall territory when you go for the mantle onto the ledge.  From here, you have three options: walk off/downclimb low angle slabs to the climber's right, belay at the ledge and climb the offwidth for the second pitch, or take a horizontal to the left onto a good ledge and belay there.  The first ascent traversed left, because I left all of my wide gear at the base after being told (erroneously) that the offwidth was too wide to protect.  Plan for #6 Friends and/or #4 Bigbros if you go that route.  The summit of the formation is another 100 or so feet beyond.  Walk off the summit to climber's right, towards Land of the Rising Moon.","protection":"A few nuts for the seam, a couple of hand-fist sized pieces for the horizontal (a #4 Friend fits incredibly well a few feet left of the cobble).  The FA used Camalots #0.75-3.5 (old style), but the offwidth will need 6\" and larger pro.","location":"About 150 feet right of\n\nGlen's First Name\n\n, or about 50 feet right of the original Water Streak.
