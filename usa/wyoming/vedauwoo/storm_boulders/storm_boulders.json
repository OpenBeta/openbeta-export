Thankfully there are enough finger pods to let it go at a reasonable grade.  Stand start in the first obvious finger pod and dance your way to the top.  This is a great little problem for those not too versed in crack climbing, as the climb requires less crack specific technique than most crack problems at Vedauwoo.  Bring your edging shoes.  Named because of the unnaturally calm day when this was put up.","protection":"A pad or two.  One large pad is probably sufficient especially if you bring a backpack or something to fill the small hole at the base of the climb, thus keeping your pad from sliding out of the landing zone.","location":"As you approach the Storm Boulders, this crack is on the large boulder on the right (west) side.  It faces south, away from the road."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,183fb1aa-8d3f-5bf1-b176-049cf356e744,68192c1e-bcae-5fc8-957c-f2bc4eb1cac0","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Vedauwoo","Storm Boulders"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.34817,41.15242]},"bbox":[-105.3487671886959,41.15197033981814,-105.34757281130409,41.15286966018188],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106196943","area_id":"aBksHryuX8iVfPK8TrHKwA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-105.3487671886959,41.15197033981814],[-105.34757281130409,41.15197033981814],[-105.34757281130409,41.15286966018188],[-105.3487671886959,41.15286966018188],[-105.3487671886959,41.15197033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:20.149Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:20.511Z"}
