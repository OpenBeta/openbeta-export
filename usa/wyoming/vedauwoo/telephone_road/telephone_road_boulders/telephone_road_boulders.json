The climbing is steep, clean and continuous.\n\nThere do appear to be approximately seven key moves on this problem.\n\nSit start on a chalked rail at the right side of the boulder, all the way in the back of the overhang.  Start a series of steep reaches straight up.   The crux is probably at about the second reach, which may be a bit hard for V2.   But you do it right at the start before you are pumped or spooked.   Then several more V2ish moves to the top.\n\nThis boulder in general is pretty good and steep all around, offering about a half a dozen problems in the V1-V4 range, including traverses and the like.   The left side of the boulder isn't quite as aesthetic, mostly due to guano, but the climbing is still fine if you don't get hantavirus.\n\nBut the right side is where Seven Levels is at and  there is no guano - just nice stone.   Another good option from the same Seven Levels start is to work your way left and finish on Annihilator, an nice V1 up the center of the boulder.","protection":"Pad and spotter.","location":"At the far end of the trail.
