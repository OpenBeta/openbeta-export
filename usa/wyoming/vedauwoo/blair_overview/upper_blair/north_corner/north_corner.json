The first crux comes immediately as you move off of the wide horizontal crack then eases a bit as you move left. Move back right, following the bolts as things start to get harder again with a couple really thin moves getting up to an incipient crack and the end of the bolts.

Stoppers worked well down low to save small gear for the steeper part of this pitch, 0.2 and 0.3 X4's protected the crux well. (45ish feet)\n\nDescend: Rap from anchors at the top of P2 (about 100' to the ground) or walk off to climbers right.
