Once we summitted this fine mountain, we killed the 30 rack of Nati Ice and hucked our portaledge off the summit using its fly as a base rig.\n\nMany years hence I returned with the degenerate Undergast Murray himself. He was in a wonderful mood, having celebrated his 30th birthday the day before. Reeking of booze and yelling at North dog, Slim managed to hold the rope as I free formed this rock climb.
