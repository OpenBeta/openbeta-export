I checked with both current guidebook authors and neither knew of previous ascents...if you know otherwise, please post up. This thing would greatly benefit from anchors IMO, and I will add some whenever I make it back that way.","protection":"(2x) #3-new #5 Camalots.","location":"This is on the SW face of the Vulture, directly opposite (facing) the mossy scramble approach to the balcony belay ledge for\n\nMedium Cool\n\nand its neighbors.
