The crux is the 5' roof about 5' up.  The roof actually downturns at the lip which makes it extra cool.  It appears as though it would take an offwidth master to pull it off, but a closer look reveals the bomber hand crack guarded by an offwidth.  Above the roof looms an offwidth that is very difficult to see.  The Upper OW is not bad.  I will leave it at that.  I did not want to haul up big pieces, so I didn't bring anything for it and was never uncomfortable.  If you pull the crux, the route should be in the bag.  However, if OWs are not your bag, you may want to bring a big piece.  This route is very enjoyable and, if you are somewhat tall, it is on the soft side of .12a.  .11+ felt pretty on.","protection":"The crux protects with BOMBPROOF #2 Camalots.","location":"This is a tricky bugger to find.
