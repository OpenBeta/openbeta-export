Start at the very far end of the roof and work your way through some offwidth moves which narrow to fists and then hands which just keep getting deeper as you go. Near the lip there are some interesting fins to negotiate. You can also go out the back side, which is a problem in its own right called \"The Dark Side of Mars\" which goes at about V4. For that version, start at the lowest point in the roof and climb out from there. The rock is especially sharp, so bring tape. Perhaps the name is in reference to Vedauwoo crack climbing in general.","protection":"A pad or two and some spotters for the lip.  Most of the roof is only a few feet above a shelf so if you fall off it is no big deal.  However the shelf drops off at both ends of the roof, leaving a not so good landing that you wouldn't really want to fall on to.  Also, the rock on this is a wee bit crunchy, so be careful about what you put your feet on when pulling either lip and topping out.","location":"Park at the end of the lower Blair parking lot.
