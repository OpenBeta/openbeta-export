Traverse the roof and fire up to a ledge.  The crux for me on the first pitch was pulling around from the traverse to the ledge.  I belayed on the ledge since I used my #5 on the first pitch and I didn't want any rope drag issues caused by the huge traverse.  For Pitch two, nice hand/fist stacks and thrashing in general will get you to the anchors at the top of the crack.  There is lots of poo in the roof traverse, but it can be avoided.\n\nThe second pitch is harder than it looks from the ground.\n\nTo keep with the Vedauwoo sandbag standards, I should probably rate this 5.9, but realistically it seemed to be in the mid-10 range.\n\nDescent:  rap from the two bolt anchor.","protection":"We did this in two pitches.  The first pitch took a few hand-size pieces, 3 #4s and a #5.  Save a #4 for the final pull out of the traverse.  I used 2 #0.75s and #0.5 for the anchor.  The offwidth second pitch can be done with a #5 and a #6 or maybe 2 #5s.  Lower to the ground, and belay your second from the two bolt anchor.","location":"It is located right of\n\nHigh Tea For Hookers\n\n.

Begin the route slightly left of the wide crack, and traverse back right when you can. The crack gets progressively wider as you get closer to the ceiling that forms a T. Boldly head straight left on horizontal crack with wide hands and less than ideal feet (heel hooking helpful). The only thing that detracts from this route is large amounts of bat poop at the traverse, luckily you can avoid it with a little care.
