This is a fifty-degree overhanging dihedral that starts out bigger than fist/fist stacks and suddenly pinches down to hand/hand stacks about a third of the way up. At the lip, it suddenly widens back to bigger than double fists. Start sitting on the obvious jug to the left of the crack. This is a high standard wide crack that is tall, committing, and pure. The rock is excellent on this one, the landing is perfectly flat, and the line is aesthetic. This is one of the best and proudest wide crack problems I have done anywhere, and I am extra proud to have onsighted this one.\n\nIt is worth noting that the beta which starts out chicken-winging the first section should be considered a variation as it avoids the proper sit start on the jug.  The same goes for any other starting beta.  Other versions are still worthy and high quality problems, but the line which climbs from lowest holds, and therefore the line which is the greatest challenge, is the sit start on the jug.  It is also worth noting that the jug sit start is the obvious start and therefore it is a little ridiculous this point needs to be clarified at all, especially considering the first section (which is largely/entirely skipped by any other variation besides the sit start on the jug) is obviously one of the hard sections which very much contributes to the grade.","protection":"A couple of pads and a spotter.  The lip is about fifteen feet up, and the crux starts where it pinches down and finishes when you top out.","location":"This is the big, obvious line that dominates The Stone Cold Cave."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,183fb1aa-8d3f-5bf1-b176-049cf356e744,cf016ec2-d4b3-5958-b148-b57707d8c4b2,d9852c51-e1ec-5d68-b386-42a815e9b421","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Vedauwoo","Mound Woodson","Stone Cold Cave, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-105.37826,41.18484]},"bbox":[-105.37885748426083,41.18439033981815,-105.37766251573913,41.18528966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107682612","area_id":"2YUsUeHsXWizhkKoFem0IQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:20.688Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:30.888Z"}
