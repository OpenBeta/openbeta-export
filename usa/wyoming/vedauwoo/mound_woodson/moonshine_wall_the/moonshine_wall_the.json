Start standing and climb to the top using a very fun and funky method/sequence.  This line is intimidating with a so-so landing, and the crux is the climbing that is 15-20 feet up.  The top section past the horizontal is pretty mild and secure despite its wide, roofy nature.  This one is pretty unique as far as wide cracks go and definitely classic.","protection":"A couple of pads and a spotter or two.
