Start matched at the bottom of the higher of the two cracks and climb out to the awkward lip encounter. There is also a lower start I put up that goes at about V7. For this one, start on the first knuckle finger locks just down from the regular start, crossing into the regular starting jams. This adds a couple of fun and difficult moves. This is definitely one of the prettiest lines around in my opinion.","protection":"One pad is fine.","location":"On the right side of the main cluster of Coyote Rocks locate the totem pole looking tower of rock.
