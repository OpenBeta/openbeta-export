This problem has a strong crimpy take-off that finishes a little thin on top. I suppose you could do a variation that goes left, but puts you in a some danger if you fall, for there is another boulder below you when you top out left.\n\nNow hopefully I got the name right of the problem and boulder.

It can be identified by the tall elongated southwest face, that looks very thin; along with a shorter northwest face that is almost completely bare.\n\nThis particular problem starts on the southeast corner of the boulder on 2 crimps. Bump through one crimp to a conehead looking crimp and top out straight above the start.
