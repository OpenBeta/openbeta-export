From here, there is a big ledge where you can pass through to the otherside of the formation to walk off or keep going up another pitch (directly to the right) to the very top of Coyote Rocks via another ramping, right-facing dihedral, short squeeze chimney and a few face moves. This section is more casual and goes in the 5.6 range. It has a nice 360 degree views of surrounding area, Eagle Rocks, etc....

As a result, I opted to dial it on TR and then boulder it. If doing this as a pure boulder, be extremely careful on the topout. I don't think you could safely fall from there, and the climbing is sequential, crunched up, and involves a bit of careful balance getting onto the slab right over the lip. This could also be done just as a TR, or as a short lead.

Start out on a decent tight hand and climb into ever thinner jams as you move up the arch, encountering one bomber finger lock along the way.  At the end of the arch, you will find a decent rest before some more hard moves to get established in the vertical upper crack.  One or two more hard moves at the top of the vertical section lead to a thank god hand jam on the shelf above the climb.  There is one section that is particularly brutal, but aside from the first few moves the climbing is difficult and sustained throughout.
