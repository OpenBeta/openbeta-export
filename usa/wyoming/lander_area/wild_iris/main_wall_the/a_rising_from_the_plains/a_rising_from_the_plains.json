The cliff is essentially veritcal, with a slight tilt at the crux, and the climbing is rather technical on tiny sharp crimps and the odd pocket.\n\nBegin with easy moves up the black streak.  A non-trivial 2-finger crank leads to another sinker pocket to clip the 2nd bolt.  Head up & right, clip with difficulty, and execute the boulder problem crux.  There are multiple ways to do this crux, but both will involve a tweaky pull off a shallow, comfortized two-finger pocket.

While this is certainly the realm of the campus junky, good footwork and a wee bit of stamina are necessary to link the route.\n\nStart as for \"...Hickock\", scrambling up the juggy boulder to the crook of the roof and the first bolt for both routes.  Bust right via a cool match to a good incut pocket.  The dynamic crux requires a precise lunge to the sinker pocket ~16\" down & right of Hickock's third bolt.  Once this pocket is latched, the real climbing begins, with a rising traverse to the right.  Good footwork is the key to a series of very long reaches between good holds, and a couple of sharp pockets.
