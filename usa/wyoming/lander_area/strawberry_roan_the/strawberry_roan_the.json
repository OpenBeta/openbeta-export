This route needs little introduction to anyone familiar with climbing in Lander. It begins with a hard sequence passing the first bolt using either a mono for the right hand or an undercling. From here the next 6 or so bolts follow jugs up the arête to a decent rest. Next fire a cool dyno and then move right past an interesting sequence to gain the upper arête. Milk a crappy rest and then fire the cryptic crux. Your right hand slaps the arête and your left hand uses the sparse pockets and edges on the left face.  Once past the crux there is still a fair bit of dancy slab climbing to get you to the anchors.","protection":"Around 12 bolts","location":"Walk right from the left side of the cliff for about 5 minutes.

There is an ok shake here with another pocket for the right hand.  After this you have to do the hardest part of the route, consisting of 2 deadpoints, first to to left hand crimp and then to a right hand pinch.
