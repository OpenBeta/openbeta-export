A high right foot aids you to move the right hand to a sloper pocket and then left goes to a positive crimp just to the right of bolt 4.  Make a difficult clip here.  Next you move up to a right hand crimp pocket and finally to a left hand letter box.  You make one more move up to a horizontal pocket band that traverses the length of the flake.  If you can, get a quick shake here, but none of the holds are any good.  Clip bolt 5 from here.\n\nFrom this point the redpoint crux ensues.  Surf up to a good left hand lay back then to a right hand one.  Next go up some gastons and finally deadpoint to a pretty good horn at the lip of the overhang.
