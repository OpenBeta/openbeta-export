Up close the stone is not quite as impressive, but the unusual, cerebral movement makes this a worthwhile objective.   Perhaps the best thing Camel Jockey has going for it is that it gets shade ~1:30pm, making it an ideal late afternoon project.  Despite its diminutive height, this is a very sustained line with many difficult moves all the way to the chains.\n\nBegin below a right-facing flake.  The difficulties begin right off the ground with a brief boulder problem to reach the first good horizontal edge.  After a quick shake the crux section begins with long opposition moves and tricky feet.  A rightward traverse ends at the route's only really good rest.  Another boulder problem leads to a sinker (often wasp-infested) two-finger pocket and more sequential movement to one last long move to a good jug just below the anchor.\n\nThis route is chipped.  On one hand, one has to wonder if this route would have gone without the enhanced holds, and at what grade.
