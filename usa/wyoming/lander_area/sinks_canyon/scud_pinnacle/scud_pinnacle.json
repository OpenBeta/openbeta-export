There are certainly many far more enjoyable routes of this grade at Sinks.\n\nBegin easily up a detached flake, and cruise the slab to the roof. Big reaches lead over the roof to dwindling holds.

The crux bulge can be made a bit easier by stemming to the nearby boulder.  This route gets shade a bit earlier in the day than the routes on the Scud Wall.  This is also the easiest way to get to the summit of the Scud Pinnacle if you don't have a rack with you (and aren't into soloing).\n\nBegin behind a bush, balancing up a protruding spike of rock, to reach good holds on the slab.
