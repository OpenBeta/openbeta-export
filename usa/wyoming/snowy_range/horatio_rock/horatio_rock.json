Four bolts long. Best to clip first bolt from the deck, then diesel the draw and clip second bolt, lower to deck, chalk and proceed. Crux is definitely height dependent. 6'4\" + looks like a v5 crux, while sub 6' looks like v7/8 crux. 12c is probably an average, but please comment and I'll tag the average as the grade.","protection":"4 bolts, 2 bolt anchor (bring 6 draws). Anchors can be hung safely by climbing back of tower.","location":"Located on the back (north) side of Horatio Rock. Access is easier from the road on north side rather than what is described for the boulders. Park in the turn out just before the fork in the road where FS 898 and FS 530 part, at the chossy wall. Cross the creek where cattle have made it easy and wander up and diagonally to the tower. Route is on NW side."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,afc3c77e-efc9-50f7-a248-5b1d2864b858,dc2f017c-2b55-54e1-b4ca-7cf980974c37,5eede34c-fc78-564f-b323-425c52f59cc4","pathTokens":["USA","Wyoming","Snowy Range","Horatio Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-106.27786,41.03479]},"bbox":[-106.27845612034422,41.03434033981814,-106.27726387965582,41.03523966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114484352","area_id":"Xu3jTPx4Vk+zI0JcUvWcxA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-106.27845612034422,41.03434033981814],[-106.27726387965582,41.03434033981814],[-106.27726387965582,41.03523966018186],[-106.27845612034422,41.03523966018186],[-106.27845612034422,41.03434033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:35:26.299Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:29.657Z"}
