It doesn't look great from the ground, but it climbs very well and the second pitch is excellent.\n\nPitch 1 (15m, 5.9) - Start up the layback corner and gain the broken ledge.  Some fiddly gear sees you into the steep/broken corner system, where good gear is available.  The final crux face move is protected by a bolt.  Build a belay on the sloping ledge above the bolt (small to medium gear).\n\nPitch 2 (25m, 5.9+) - Trend up the right leaning crack, through the pod, and out onto the headwall.  Good gear is available everywhere on this section.  Eventually you'll hit a sloping ledge system.  Work left to the base of the final crack.  Some funky moves (and thin gear) get you through the final crack.  Step left to the chains.\n\nYou could link both pitches, but the rope drag wouldn't make it any fun, especially with the crux of the second pitch coming at the end.\n\nRap the route via chains located at the top.  The chains are located awkwardly left of the final portion of the crack.  Our 70m rope JUST made it with rope stretch, and you would definitely need two ropes if you had a 60m.\n\nIf in doubt, bring two ropes!\n\nupdate!\n\nWent and did the route with a different \"70m\" rope and the rope DID NOT make it this time.  Fortunately the rope made the ledge about 25 feet off the ground, and easy downclimbing (climber's right) brought us to the ground.  A 60m rope might not make this ledge....","protection":"Two sets of cams from small TCUs to #3 camalot.  Nuts including small wires/RPs.
