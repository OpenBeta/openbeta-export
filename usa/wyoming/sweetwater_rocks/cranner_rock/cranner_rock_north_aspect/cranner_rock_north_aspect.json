The first half is mostly slopey jugs outside the crack. Start with a yellow c3 or similar size to protect the first difficult move, pulling a small overhang on slopers. Next, place a green c3 or equivalent from a good stance. Just above this is a great nut placement, it's actually been fixed for the last few years. Next go to a left slopey crimp outside the crack, get a crappy right hand jamb in the crack and crank up to a better left hold/jug left of the crack. High feet get you to a right hand jug from which you place a blue camalot or similar in a pod just below your hand. Next get a heel hook with the right foot outside the crack and reach high to a great hand jamb with the left. You clip a bolt here, which was placed to keep the rope out of the crack.\n\nThe crux is next. Reach really far to a right thumbs down finger lock, throw a left heel on the lip of the overlap and crank up to thin right handjamb. Most people then match in an undercling below the handjamb to readjust. There is an optional grey camalot placement here. You next reach really high over the second tier of the roof to a decent right hand finger lock. Then match left hand, shimmy up and over the last bulge and finally get to a bomber left hand finger lock. That's my blow by blow.\n\nThe last 20-30 feet is decent but pumpy 5.11 fingers in a corner.","protection":"Small stoppers and c3s or similar for the bottom.  A 3.5 friend or blue camalot protects the section before the roof.  There is a bolt in the roof section that makes the crux feel more secure, if just a little.  The top is finger and hands gear, you need 2 or three pieces above the crux.  There are fixed stoppers in the steep section before the bolt and then after the roof in the vert corner.  This route was originally done with a fixed pin protecting the crux instead of the bolt.  It was common to get the rope stuck in the crack, but this has been largely eliminated with the bolt.  Whatever your ethics are on this, I for one was glad to clip it.  There is a 2 bolt anchor with rap rings at the top.  Oh, you can also rap from a 1 bolt anchor on top of the cliff down to this 2 bolt station if you want to set up a TR.","location":"North side of Cranner rock.
