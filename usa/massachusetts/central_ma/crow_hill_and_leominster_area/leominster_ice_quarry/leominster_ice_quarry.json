Easy access and a nice vista make it a great place to climb when the sun has been absent for several days allowing the ice to build.\n\n Bring long slings or a static rope for anchors as the trees are a ways back from the edge. The crag gets a lot of sun and can get baked of pretty quickly on warm days. Ideal conditions tend to be cloudy days after a heavy snow."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:19.974Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:45.465Z"}
