Start up the face below the crack. Once you gain the crack, pull a small overhang to its right while placing bomber gear (large cams) in the crack. A reachy move to a left facing horn gains a ledge to rest before tackling the crux overhanging face to the top. Pumpy moves up the face will test your finger strength for the grade. Caution!!!! The best hold before the top-out is a large, hollow flake of rock below the top. It makes an obvious, scary hollow sound when tapped. It is not to be trusted, and I plan to clean it off with a crow-bar at some point.","protection":"The climb takes plenty of gear. Mostly cams, however some of the placements are in poor rock.
