However, it is of the thin and scrappy sort. Sun bakes it out really fast. \n\n  The cave usually has the most ice. There are several potential lines here, depending on the conditions. Left side of the cave have an ice curtain of variable quality. The overhanging section to the right of the cave could have potential for some hard dry-tooling.  \n\n  Importantly, take care not to scratch up the rock-climbing routes in this popular area (=keep the winter-tools away from the rock routes!)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:20.376Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:48.055Z"}
