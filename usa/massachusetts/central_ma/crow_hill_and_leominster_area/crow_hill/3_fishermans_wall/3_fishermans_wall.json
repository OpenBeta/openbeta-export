We kept coming back together there over the course of a couple of months to put it up and then never climbed there again as most of our time was spent in the Gunks, Cannon, or CT. \n\n  The climb actually starts at the top out of Tarzan, traverses across a couple of old lines, and swings the arete to climb the overhanging face on the other side topping out directly under the hanging block. \n\n  While putting it up, we logged a lot of air time turning the arete and off the overhanging face on other side of it and blew through about eighteen Air Voyagers in the process (an old type of screamer once made by Wild Things\n\n), and that included multiple falls per screamer which we kept sport taping back up and reusing until all the bar tacks were blown. \n\n  We all gave it about the same number of goes, but Marco came up with the goods and brass ring for the FA. \n\n  Great fun.  \n\n  [ Probably should have called it 'Cheetah' at the time and glad someone finally thought to pay that homage.

There are three variations to this start, but most people opt to enter from the right on big, chalked holds.  After clipping the bolt (gear can easily substitute), move up on a few slopey holds before hitting the jams.  What's great about this climb is the variety of jams ranging mixing fingers, hands, fists, and even a little OW to gain a good rest, but the choice remains mostly yours as several sizes are often available depending on what suits you.  If you can fight off the pump long enough, one hard move starting the leftward traverse marks the end of the difficult climbing which ends as the crack turns the corner.  If, TR'ing, you can end here or finish up on Green Corner or try the arete above. \n\n  Though the climb has always been dry when I've seen it even when others are soaking, the crack and face tend to be a little dirty, so either bring a brush or find solid jams because they may slide out unexpectedly.
