The best part of the climb is the top, while the bottom is marked by a number of large ledges between short faces.  Climb the left side of the block to a large ledge beneath the first overhang.  A medium-sized cam protects the moves up to the second large ledge beneath overhang number two.  Work your feet up the left wall and use a couple of good holds on the right side to pull over.  Similar climbing leads through the third overhang.  Finish up a corner, exit right, and rappel off trees to descend.  This is probably not the best candidate for a beginning leader because of the potential to hit a ledge beneath each of the overhangs.","protection":"Light rack with small to medium gear.","location":"Climbs the corner above and to the left of the old tree trunk through the namesake overhangs."},"__v":0},{"_id":"4aVUVgmJV3GL6pTZuOGjqw==","name":"Tiny Pitches","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.8596,42.5191]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"106604034","mp_crag_id":"105907190","climb_id":"4aVUVgmJV3GL6pTZuOGjqw==","areaRef":"EwxfXjkKWSi3ySbCOwYG/g=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the block in the Green Corner as for Sun Gypsy and move to the left of the large old tree trunk.

Because of the long traverse, the climb is usually split into two pitches.  If you've already climbed Triple Overhangs and Green Gremlin and don't want to repeat the start for the third time, you can rappel from a pine tree at the top of the cliff to the base of the open book.  Climb the left side of the block to the large ledge below the Green Gremlin corner.  Traverse right along the ledge for about 60 feet to the base of a short open book and belay here.  Climb the short dihedral with the nice finger crack.  The crux is exiting the corner where there are two options - left or right.  Look for a great hold up and over the top and pull yourself over.  Fun climb, too bad it's so short. \n\n  To descend, either rappel from trees at the top or walk off left.","protection":"A light rack with small to medium gear.","location":"This shares the start with Triple Overhangs and Green Gremlin right of the tree trunk and up the left side of a large block."},"__v":0},{"_id":"XHt/bWd7U86WWDETEh+wKg==","name":"Green Gremlin","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.8596,42.5191]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"105907201","mp_crag_id":"105907190","climb_id":"XHt/bWd7U86WWDETEh+wKg==","areaRef":"EwxfXjkKWSi3ySbCOwYG/g=="},"content":{"description":"Green Gremlin looks better from the ground than it actually is.
