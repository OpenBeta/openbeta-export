Given the short approach, ease of setting up top ropes, and proximity to Boston, it can get quite crowded on the weekends and is popular with outdoor clubs. Routes can be up to almost 100' in length and can be led or toproped, but if leading, keep in mind that some climbs have interesting topouts. Plan on bringing long slings/extra cord for top rope anchors. The condition of the floor of the canyon can be pretty variable and make some routes difficult to climb. \n\n  Routes are ordered left to right as you are facing the concrete tunnel at the end of the canyon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:19.968Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:47.520Z"}
