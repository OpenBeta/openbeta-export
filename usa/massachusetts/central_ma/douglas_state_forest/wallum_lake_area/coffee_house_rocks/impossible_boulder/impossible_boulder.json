Reach up, and just right of the arete there is a small sloped crimp. Pull on, and follow a line of similarly difficult crimps up and left to the apex of the boulder for a relatively easy topout. This will take a really strong crimper to take down this line, which should easily be into the double digits.

It's a good way to practice for the two most classic boulders at Pawtuckaway, incorporating a bat hang like Overlooked, V4, and a similar mantel finish as for Ride The Lightning, V6 (just not fifteen feet off the deck). Naturally the problem isn't nearly as good as the aforementioned climbs, but it does climb incredibly well for being so tiny.Sit start on a ledge just above the ground, and kick your feet up above your head into a bat hang on the lip. Pull a hand onto the lip to match with your feet, and then flip your body around in order to make an awesome high footed mantel.","protection":"A crashpad or two.","location":"Looking at the blank face, round the boulder to the right.
