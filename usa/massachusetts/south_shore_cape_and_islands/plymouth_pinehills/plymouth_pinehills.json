It is hardly a destination for climbing, but the hills offer some nice hiking/biking, and there's a cool firetower near the center. Most of the boulders are not much more than ~6 feet tall, but there are a few nice tops/traverses. The area could make for a fun afternoon exploring. The powerlines make for a nice direct approach, and from there, you can take one of the many paths off into the woods to explore. The snapchat map offers a surprisingly accurate map of the trails here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:36.925Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:30.565Z"}
