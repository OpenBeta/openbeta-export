The cliff is composed of what is known as Mt. Toby Conglomerate which is a pockety hodge-podge of medium quality rock, a stark contrast to the gneiss in the region but a pleasant change. The Sunbowl hosts llitle more than a dozen routes overall, but they range from approximately 5.6 to 5.11 as well as a boulder traverse of the base of the cliff (~V2).The crag stands at about 35 feet tall overall. A slabby section on the far left gives way to a slightly overhanging buttress which then leads to a steep center face and moderate right side face. All routes are well-protected sport lines with installed rappel anchors (any climb here can be climbed with 6 or fewer draws). Due to the nature of the rock here, it is best to inspect each bolt for security upon using it. Top access at the Sunbowl is poor, so the best option is to simply lead a climb then hang a top-rope.The Sunbowl is generally southwest- facing and receives sun from at least noon onwards (hence the name). In the fall, winter, and early spring, the crag gets nice sun for warmth and in the summer is shaded well enough under the canopy of trees. A large flat rock is situated at the center of the crag and is a great staging area for gear. Remember to bring bug spray, sun screen, and sunglasses."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":14,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:37.558Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:33.987Z"}
