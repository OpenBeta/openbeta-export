The scattered erratic boulders are of an exceptionally high quality fine-grained granitic gneiss. The approaches are long (at least 1-2 miles each way), but it is easy traveling on established snowmobile trails. There is no apparent evidence of prior climbing. More information is coming soon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:38.542Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:32.596Z"}
