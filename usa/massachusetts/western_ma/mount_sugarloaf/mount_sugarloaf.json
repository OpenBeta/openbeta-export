Many a Western Mass climber has gazed longingly at this cliff while driving north to climb something far away, wondering if they could climb such a beautiful cliff so close to home. Unfortunately, it's total choss and pretty much unclimbable, but it ices up in the winter! There's one fat ice flow that goes down the center of the cliff and just begs to be climbed as you drive by it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:38.247Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:09.242Z"}
