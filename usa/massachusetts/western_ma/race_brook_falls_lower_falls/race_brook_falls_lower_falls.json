The lower falls faces east with ice flows from around 30 - 40 feet. Expect sun in the morning and shade later on in the day. Starting on the left side, the ice is Ssteeper and felt WI3, maybe soft WI4, depending on the line you take. On the right side, there is a flow of low angle ice WI1 and that gets slightly steeper on the end of the flow, WI2. You can set up topropes for all of these climbs, and the best way to access the top is hiking left from the base of the falls. Hiking up the hill left will gain you access to Upper Race Brook Trail and to the top on of Lower Falls."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:37.560Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:34.001Z"}
