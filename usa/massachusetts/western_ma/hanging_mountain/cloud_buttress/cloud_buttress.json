Regardless of how you climb it, it's hard not to smile on your way to the chains.The route is ever so slightly overhanging, so in a light drizzle, it is still climbable. Stone by Stone receives morning and evening shade and direct sun in the afternoon. The crack at the base emanates cold air year round.The name of the route was inspired by Robert M.
