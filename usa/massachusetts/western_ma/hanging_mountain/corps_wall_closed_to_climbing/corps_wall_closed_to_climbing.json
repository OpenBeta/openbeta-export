PLEASE DO NOT CLIMB HERE.A note from the WMCC (November 2021):In 2019, the WMCC purchased a majority of the Hanging Mountain cliff line; however, the wall farthest to the climber's right is on US Army Corps of Engineers land. Climbing is currently an unauthorized activity on the US Army Corps of Engineers abutting property as the WMCC and RMF continue negotiations to re-open access. It is critical that we respect these rules. Any climbing at the Corps Wall during this closure could compromise future access for climbing in the area.This wall is on US Army Corps of Engineers land and has solid stone with some excellent sport and trad testpieces. All routes are currently CLOSED."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:38.254Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:09.555Z"}
