Wrestle your way up the gneiss bulge, and mantel on top of it; a good rest here lets you ponder the finish sequence through more crimpers 'n' smears. The climb gets some decent morning to late afternoon sun.The anchors were originally for the 5.8 on the left, and this route seemed pretty decent after a clean and some topropes, so I figured it was worth the hardware even though the route spacing is a bit close.I named the route for the obvious bulge 2/3 the way up before knowing the name of the wall or any of the route names on the wall... so even though it's not the most progressive, I hope you have a giggle and enjoy the climb!","protection":"bolts to loweroffs.","location":"Go up the stairs on the right side of the Progressive Wall to the right of the two 5.8s.Be super mindful of sensitive plants!"},"__v":0},{"_id":"/o9uSLnVVKOE/oLeH+O7vQ==","name":"Beginnings End","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Kat Powers & Shawn Sweeney","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.06678,42.0709]},"left_right_index":7,"mp_id":"121496500","mp_crag_id":"121413301","climb_id":"/o9uSLnVVKOE/oLeH+O7vQ==","areaRef":"7Yvyx6wPXtu9Tbcilw9rNg=="},"content":{"description":"I am getting a description from Kat later.
