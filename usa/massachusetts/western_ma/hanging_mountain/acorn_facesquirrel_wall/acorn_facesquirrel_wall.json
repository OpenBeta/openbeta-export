Follow a pillar (be aware of hornets on the left) to a set of cruxy roofs and then to a bolted anchor on a large ledge.P4: 10b. A short pitch leads to a bolted anchor. TR off this pitch to save some time.Rap the route with a 60m rope.

The 3rd bolt line from the far left. You will see the bolts going up very clean, verticle rock that looks like it's 5.11+. But don't be discouraged by the appearance! The first section leading up to the small ledge is surprisingly easy on good holds. The first challenge is ascending from the ledge - where several betas are available but they are all technical and non-obvious. One of them involves discovering a well-hidden foothold towards the left. The 2nd challenge is a very usual move at a horizontal crack. The 3rd challenge (typically for taller people) is the move out of the verticle section. Smooth sailing up right on the low angle portion to the two bolt anchor from there on.
