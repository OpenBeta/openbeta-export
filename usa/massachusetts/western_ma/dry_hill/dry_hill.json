The cam and tricam weren't ideal (too far to the side), and next time I will look for other options. There are bomber trees that are slightly further away than is convenient. We used a tree to protect the belayer given the awkward arrangement of the anchor relative to the comfy belay ledge.","location":"Stand at the rusty piton. Looking over the edge, find the comfy obvious belay station ~4 feet below you. Look to the right for a ~8 foot wide face between an obvious arete to the left and dihedral to the right.

A well-maintained trail leads to the summit of Dry Hill, the top of a ~35-40 foot (?) crag.  \n\n  The wall itself is near vertical with some promising aretes and dihedrals. We've only tried 1 line so far, but a quick look around from below suggests there are probably around 10 potential routes. Most look fairly moderate. \n\n  Loose rock is a big risk here. I would not be comfortable belaying from below, or really being anywhere near below a climber. We TRed from above, and I plan to do that for the foreseeable future here. If this out-of-the-way crag somehow gets some traffic and the loose rocks get knocked away, it is ripe for moderate trad leads. \n\n  There is an old, rusted piton with a ring in the summit. My best (uninformed) guess is that it is from before 1960. Based on the loose rocks, plants, and cleanliness of the rock, this hasn't been climbed in decades."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:38.249Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:34:08.964Z"}
