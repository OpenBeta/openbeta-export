The route starts on top of a small fallen boulder and follows the flakes until they run out. When the flake runs out, the crux starts. Use 2 small crimps to the left and a high right foot to reach a good right hand sidepull, then traverse right to the next good quartz covered crack system. There are good holds to the ledge and the end of the climb. Enjoy!","protection":"Rope protectors","location":"Just north of Tom Leonard Shelter along the AT (coming from the shelter), cross the stream, and go up the hill.
