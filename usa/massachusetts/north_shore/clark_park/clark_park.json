It has loose crappy rock in most areas, be careful belaying. It is a long distance to trees for anchors, bring long slings or extra ropes. There is better quality rock on the first base side, with really crumbly stone behind the third base bleachers. \n\n  Be aware there will usually be high school kids around the top smoking pot. So, keep an eye on your gear, and keep tension on your anchor. I've never had a problem with them, but it is better to be safe than sorry. \n\n  There are no routes established yet. I just use this area as an anyday training spot. I will add any worthy routes. If anyone finds a good line, PLEASE add it as a route."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:25.171Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:52.493Z"}
