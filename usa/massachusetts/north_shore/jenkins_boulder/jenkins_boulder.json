However, the boulder is so large and featured that it is worth checking out if you are anywhere in the North Shore area. Combined with a visit to nearby Den Rock, one could have a fine day of low-key eastern Massachusetts climbing. The rock is about 25 feet high, and features problems and routes up all of its faces, as well as several traverse variations. There is potential for hard problems here, although as locals have been climbing here for over 35 years, most lines have likely been done. There is a pin on top, and gear placements are abundant if you wish to toprope the overhanging section. \n\n  Note: The boulder is on private property. The Andover Village Improvement Society allows public access from sunrise to sunset. There is no camping or biking.
