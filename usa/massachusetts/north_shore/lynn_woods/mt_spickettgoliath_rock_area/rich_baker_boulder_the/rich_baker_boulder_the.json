With a good, high left foot, navigate the crimpy face to a good incut, horizontal, crimp rail/seam. This is a pretty good stance to place a somewhat shitty nut in the pocket up and to the left of the good incut rail. Make a few really nice face moves to get into the big undercling above. Enjoy an easier topout! This is a bold lead indeed. It is R, since after the first nut, there is no gear until the undercling. A fall placing/clipping a piece at the undercling would be a groundfall.\n\n The crux is getting to the incut seam. The upper moves into the undercling are precarious making this a bold lead and impressive/risky highball. I gave it a V4, since it is likely hard V3 moves in \"do-not-fall\" territory.","protection":"Get a somewhat decent nut (#3 BD) at the first stance, a bomber #0.75 BD Camalot works well in the undercling, and place one more small cam or nut after that to protect the topout. This could be done as a boulder highball.
