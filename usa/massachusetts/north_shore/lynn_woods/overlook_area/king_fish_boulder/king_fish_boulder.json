It is the prominent line and begs to be climbed. It follows the side of the boulder around two main bulges and then into a technical face. From there, you stretch it out on unique holds to a easy topout. Bring your endurance! The land rises with you as you climb up, so you're never too far from the ground. \n\n  This climb is a link-up between two problems with a good rest in between. You can stand up and leave the route at this rest. The FA included a brief rest without standing up. If this were a trad route, you'd make a belay at this spot. The first 25 feet to the rest \"belay\" goes at about V4. The remaining portion (20') is a harder making the whole thing an estimated V5. \n\n  A sit start can be done starting at the good rail using the fish jaw for tricky feet. Reach for a hidden hold near the fish jaw, and balance up into the stand start. The sit adds length, not necessarily difficultly unless you have a short wing span.","protection":"Multiple pads or one pad and active spotter.","location":"It is on O29 on the Caltopoo map. \n\n  From Weetamoo, take the Overlook Express from near Graffiti boulder to O29."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e5b1ee9c-9c10-5a01-91e0-850f40c2e1be,c158c8b6-39ef-540b-9e1d-e4133c1864e8,2a40e704-cca6-5cd0-8b7d-404654e65186,70a5fd61-2c23-5c6f-8b7f-fbcc6a5d0125,a841cc61-97b4-5748-81fe-2bcb9452af17","pathTokens":["USA","Massachusetts","North Shore","Lynn Woods","Overlook Area","King Fish Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.99887,42.49501]},"bbox":[-70.99947984419134,42.49456033981814,-70.99826015580864,42.495459660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"113536356","area_id":"qEHMYZe0V0iB/ivLlFKvFw=="},"content":{"description":"This boulder is set into the hillside on the shore of Walden Pond.
