Move out left following the crack for a few moves until you can gain the good hold under the bulge. From there, move up to a good jug. Move up to marginal holds, and trend left across the dicey slab to gain a good rail and, soon after, the lip at the top.\n\n This is the prominent line up the feature. A toprope anchor can be built with 3-4 cams ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 and a 10' piece of looped webbing.\n\n The FA was done with a TR. This would be a highball V4 boulder problem with a crux about 12' up before a dicey slab! Go get it!\n\n If you are tall enough, there is an early escape out right once you gain the upper slab.","protection":"Lots of pads or a TR.","location":"Find the Substation Bluff, then find the nicest line that goes up it.
