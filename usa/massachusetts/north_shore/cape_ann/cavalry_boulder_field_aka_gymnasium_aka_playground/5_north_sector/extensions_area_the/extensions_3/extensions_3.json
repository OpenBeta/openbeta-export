It is the only genuine line on the boulder.  \n\n  Stand start matched on an obvious flake and pull onto the boulder. A few moves up and left will get you set up for the big reach out right towards the sloper.  \n\n  A bit of tension and balance will get you through the crux, then it's just a good old fashioned topout straight up the middle.  \n\n  This route is short and goes smoothly at V1 if you've got the beta figured out. While it is not a destination climb (are there any of those in Mass.?), it is certainly a fun way to enjoy the great outdoors.  \n\n  A sit-start is possible and might add considerable difficulty, but the holds are a bit sharper than the normal start.  \n\n  Also, I've had 2 sightings of a fearless Fisher Cat here, so be on the lookout for some wildlife to complete your sense of adventure.","protection":"Pad.","location":"This is the only prominent route on the Extensions 3 Boulder.
