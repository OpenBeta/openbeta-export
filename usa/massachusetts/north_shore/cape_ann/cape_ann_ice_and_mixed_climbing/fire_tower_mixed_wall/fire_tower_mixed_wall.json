The wall is dank and scrappy enough that it won't really interest boulderers.  Underneath the moss, there are many decent edges for mixed bouldering. There also a thin seam that can be climbed with intricate tool work.  The landing is even pretty good. It is maybe 15' at its highest."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:31.940Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:26.750Z"}
