It uses the sharp, quarried arete to climb the fairly blank face to the top.    \n\n  Start on the left where the arete is horizontal on continue right and up.  The start requires precise edging, while the end requires burly smearing.    \n\n  It's named after an odd feature in the rock.   \n\n  4 Stars if you like this sort of face/slab climbing.","protection":"Pad or pads.  The landing is good, but watch the slab to the right.   Things can get a little weird if you fall, because the crux involves some tenuous moves.  The topout is actually straightforward, but there is no lip or jug waiting (think dome), so you have to smear upward the whole way.","location":"This is at the far end of the slab on top of the right end of Down Under.   \n\n  Walk off right."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e5b1ee9c-9c10-5a01-91e0-850f40c2e1be,c158c8b6-39ef-540b-9e1d-e4133c1864e8,0651db45-b05c-551c-b844-9ff04cb3b94f,fd9b97c5-cd96-5df6-9e63-26378b26ce63,6cba73c6-0744-5c7f-b00b-d9f787e51001,810124c7-3c71-525e-b178-48870d0c9cf0,a94e4a90-af1f-58cc-b151-29e49fd8808e","pathTokens":["USA","Massachusetts","North Shore","Cape Ann","Redrocks and Vicinity","Redrocks Bouldering","Plateau Boulder","Half Dome Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.6668,42.6188]},"bbox":[-70.66741105515557,42.61835033981814,-70.66618894484442,42.619249660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108386067","area_id":"qU5KkK8fWMyxUSnkn9iAjg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-70.66741105515557,42.61835033981814],[-70.66618894484442,42.61835033981814],[-70.66618894484442,42.619249660181865],[-70.66741105515557,42.619249660181865],[-70.66741105515557,42.61835033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is long, short slab located between Down Under and the Plateau Boulders in the Redrock/Mt.
