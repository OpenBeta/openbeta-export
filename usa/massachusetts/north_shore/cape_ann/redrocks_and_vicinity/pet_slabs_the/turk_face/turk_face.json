It contains several fun friction routes.  The left side is very moderate and lower angle, but the right side is quite steep.   Having been protected under a layer of thick moss, the rock here is mostly lichen-free and amazingly grippy leading to excellent friction, which is good considering the noticeable absence of holds.  Because of the blankness of the rock, actual lines are difficult to follow.  Routes listed are mere suggestions. \n\n  Most of the routes can be top-roped from a small tree right at the top of the slab.  If it seems this slab is getting use, I'll add anchors.
