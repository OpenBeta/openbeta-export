Seriously. . . on my last visit this crack was oozing with garter snakes. A particular large one had wrapped itself around the chockstone at mid-height. The base is also filled with shedded skin.  As this face catches the sun and the cracks offers protection, it's a great spot for those ectothermically inclined.
