It sits near a slab with a bench made from lobster traps. There are two overhung sides and two slabby sides. There are some very hard lines on this boulder. One of the lines resembles The Darkling over in Town Line. It's also host to a couple really nice moderates on the overhung face, and easier slabs over on the other side. \n\n  To make things easier I threw names on the climbs that are just parts to a lobster trap.
