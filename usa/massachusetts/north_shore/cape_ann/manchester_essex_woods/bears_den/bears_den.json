Laybacking and smearing at changing angles to a spicy topout make this one of the best lines on the peninsula. The physical crux is probably coming off the sit, but the mental crux is a lot higher!\n\n This climb was likely done as a stand-start toprope \"back-in-day\" and was probably given a 5.9+ grade. It is better if done as a boulder problem from the sit! It has been brought back to life.","protection":"A TR anchor can be built with some large cams (A #4, #3, and #2 C4s fit well, but a #6 might be best).
