The routes are longer than they appear from the ground and are definitely worth a casual visit.\n\n Bring a standard rack to a #3 for most climbs. There are glue-ins with quicklinks and rap rings at the top. Please DO NOT toprope from the rings. Rap with a 60m, or walk straight back past the boulder and off the large gully climber’s left.\n\n For TR'ing, a quad works well for most climbs. A boulder pinch anchor can be used to access the top anchor safely.\n\n For a few years anyway, full-length climbing was blocked by a large, fallen pine. While cleaning the area, we found an OLD climbing sling buried beneath the sod. In other ways too, it was obvious this crag had been climbed before, but attempts at finding its history have thus far come up empty. The names given are only working titles until further information is discovered.
