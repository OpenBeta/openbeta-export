Ir is an awesome time if it's a nice day. There are only about three boulder problems that I have found so far. There is good potential for more also.  \n\n  The first one is an overhanging problem of an arete. Start under the boulder with good handholds the foot holds aren't very good, so use your heel to start. Work up the overhang. The top out is very simple. You will get this route, no problem.  \n\n  The second boulder route is to the left of this one on the biggest boulder on the beach. It starts standing on another boulder. Put your hands in the crack. Traverse right about 5 feet to slopers, then reach up to grab a good jug. Pull up for the finish jug and top out.  \n\n  The third route is on the far left end of the big boulder. Start sitting with hands in the crack work around the arete. I never finished this problem, so I'm not 100% sure about the finishing moves. I will let you know as soon as I do. \n\n  I have only finished the first route, Before the Dinosaurs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:25.770Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:55.624Z"}
