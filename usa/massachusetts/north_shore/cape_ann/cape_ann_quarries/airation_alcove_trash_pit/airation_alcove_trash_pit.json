Since the closing of the Rockport Granite Co. and the filling of the reservoirs, this area has been made independent of the main quarry by the trail and land between. This pit has a lot of potential and feels like a mini-alpine area.\n\n In the winter, it sometimes grows a massive curtain of ice, great for toproping or a solid leader.\n\n As with all of my posts, names given are working titles, any information about these areas is welcome and will be incorporated.
