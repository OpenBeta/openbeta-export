One hosts a ~20-25' high, continuously overhung wall over a very deep pool of water, making it perfect for DWS. As of 6/2016, most of the wall is in need of substantial cleaning but a few lines have been partly cleaned and two lines have seen ascents, both in the 11 range. \n\n  There's a legal parking spot in front, and a 30 second walk gets you to the goods. As long as nobody pisses off the neighbors, this will probably end up the best DWS spot near Boston. Swimming in the quarries is currently allowed, according to the website."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:31.940Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:02:24.830Z"}
