There is an obvious right, slanted foot hold. Start with a right sort of drop knee and a small, left, crimpy foot hold. There are a lot of small hand crimps as you follow the roof left and up. There is one good hand along the top of the roof, although it is not fully necessary to use this. As the roof becomes vertical, the hand holds and foot holds become very easy. I rated this based off the awkward positions you need to start in and the step through move you need to make coming off the start.","protection":"A crashpad would be recommended, but there is a pretty good landing area.","location":"This is an obvious boulder on the Beaver Loop Trail near the end that overlooks the river.
