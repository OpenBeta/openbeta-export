The boulders here are somewhat spread out but are mostly located around the rock playground closest to the Trotting Park Road entrance on the south side of the Forest. There are about 5 or so boulders with worthwhile climbing that I have found and some potential for others and new routes. Not being on the climbing radar, many of the boulders are frequently used for campfire backstops and collect glass and other sharps. Plan to do some stewardship, and pack out some trash if you visit. Despite the fire and trash scene, the boulders here are worth a visit. Also of note, this area can be great for little kids to climb as there are many smaller \"kid boulders\" and a few geocaches.
