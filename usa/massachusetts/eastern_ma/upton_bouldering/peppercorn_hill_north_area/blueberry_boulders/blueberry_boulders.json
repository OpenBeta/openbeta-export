The boulders further north have rockier landings and may be hard to protect even if the area is cleaned.Many wild blueberry bushes grow in this area, but be sure of your ability to identify them as there are also questionable darker berries that grow nearby that probably aren't blueberries.This area was originally identified on Mountainproject by J.
