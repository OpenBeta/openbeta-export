If you like basically vertical, crimpy problems, this is the one for you.I’ve brought someone that’s climbed for years and years, and he felt the rock was also super high quality.The entirety of the problem really lies in the bottom half, maybe 3/4 with the top bit being pretty easy but nerve-racking. The topout is not super great, but if you move your foot up like I did in the video, it becomes alright.I listed it initially as a V6. I made the second third and fourth known ascents, but I’m not sure if it is V6. Any input would be great.","protection":"Have 2-3 pads and a couple friends to spot you - ideally two below you, one on the little block of rock behind you with your friends ready to catch you.
