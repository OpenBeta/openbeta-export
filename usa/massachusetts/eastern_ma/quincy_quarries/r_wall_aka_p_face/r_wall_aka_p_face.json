It is a short, forty foot slab that offers a handful of moderate routes from 5.3 to 5.7. All but two of the climbs originate on the left side of the formation, while a pair of climbs and the descent route are found on the right side. Due to the fact that nearly every square inch of this wall seams to be covered with paint, none of the routes are particularly noteworthy. \n\n  L->R: \n\n  A. Ron's Arete, 3, 1p, gear.   BC.
