The first section follows the prominent overhanging crack at the highest part of the wall. The second part continues straight up to the second and last ledge. The final section is the shortest and mainly consists of a long move (read: dyno) up to a small shelf. This move is hard to protect, and the Boston Rocks book indicates that the FFA was done by toproping this section. The last section can be made easy by going diagonally up to the left.
