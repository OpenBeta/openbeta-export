This crag consists of a small 15 foot double wall. There is also a worthy boulder up the hill. \n\n  Second crag - just across the street before the closed pullout onto the fireroad that parallels the Rattlesnake Rocks main crag, there is a fire road that heads east. Park along the road (there is a pullout downhill on Wampatuck Rd.) and walk on the trail. The crag and a couple satellite boulders will be visible on the left just down the hill. This crag is the same dark very fine-grained granite as Burger Boulder, bullet hard with good edges and incuts, and consists of a taller 25 foot section, a short and very hard overhanging roof, and a low wall with a couple boulder problems on top. There is a small but excellent boulder on top of the crag and a couple more in the woods surrounding."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:21.471Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:13.617Z"}
