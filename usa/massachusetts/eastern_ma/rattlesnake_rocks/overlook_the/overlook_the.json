Awkward hands with places to cam your feet. Protect with #5 or #6 Camalot or stick clip a bolt about 10 feet up on the face to the right of a narrow, left-leaning chimney. If you don't have big gear, the start into the chimney is hard to protect without clipping the bolt and would lead to a bad landing if you slip or fall out before placing the first piece. However, the bolt is tough to clean and using it worsens rope drag. Grovel up and left through the crux as the chimney tries to spit you out - skinny people may find this easier than husky types. It is tough to place and clip gear here. Wise gear racking on your harness will help. After a small shelf, the climb eases considerably, but watch for rope drag. Belay from a tree and gear.After doing this a few times, think about protecting the leader (or even follower considering rope stretch) from hitting the sharp finback rock at the base of the climb.
