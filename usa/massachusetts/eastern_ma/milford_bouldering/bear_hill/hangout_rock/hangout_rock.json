There are a lot of easy, uneventful ways to get to the top. It is a great spot for some inexperienced climbers or people trying to get into the sport.\n\n Update as of June 2019:\n\n I am of the opinion that Hangout Rock has been moved and made unsafe by the bulldozing of Bear Hill. Based on the GPS location for hangout rock, a road had been cut by heavy machinery right through where it should be (and the surrounding area). Walking around, I believe to have found it about 100-150m away from its marked location, but it has been buried in a dirt pile."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:23.298Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:15.457Z"}
