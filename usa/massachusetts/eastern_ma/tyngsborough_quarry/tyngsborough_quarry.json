The route has several large ledges and jugs which make it pretty easy but fun. The rock quality is very nice; too bad there's not more of it.","protection":"You could set a top rope up top if you're nervous about falling off. The route is very easy, but you wouldn't want to fall - you might hit rock or roll downhill for a while. I wore a helmet and had a spotter.","location":"The quarry wall forms a rough semi-circle which looks out on the street. Walk up the sloping hill to about the middle of the wall, you'll see a prong-like horn rock about a foot tall at the top of the wall with a tree growing out of the rock just left of it. Start below and left of the horn and work your way up using easy holds. Just be careful, there's loose rock here and there. This particular climb appears to be the most solid in the area. Much of the wall appears fractured and unstable."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e5b1ee9c-9c10-5a01-91e0-850f40c2e1be,f4e43cd6-30c3-5d91-9fcb-6f08c88c2e75,9e57e033-d8a4-5da3-b66e-59f2ecd75f6e","pathTokens":["USA","Massachusetts","Eastern, MA","Tyngsborough Quarry"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Unknown"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.4221,42.6734]},"bbox":[-71.4227115917132,42.67295033981814,-71.42148840828682,42.673849660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107925002","area_id":"nlfgM9ikXaO2blny7Ndfbg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.4227115917132,42.67295033981814],[-71.42148840828682,42.67295033981814],[-71.42148840828682,42.673849660181865],[-71.4227115917132,42.673849660181865],[-71.4227115917132,42.67295033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is an old quarry. The tallest face is about 14 feet, slightly overhanging (although the photo makes it look slabby). It's shady with a steep base that would make crash pads impractical.
