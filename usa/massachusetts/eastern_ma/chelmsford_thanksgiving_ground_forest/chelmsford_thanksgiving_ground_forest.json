Thought it was going to be slightly harder, but found the rightmost hold after having overlooked it at first. The crux is probably the move out far left just because of the body position. After getting the right foot up on the starting rail, the hard part is over, and it becomes a balance problem.\n\n There may also be a way to avoid the move out far left, you can see one potential hold I chalked in the photo of the start rail and never ended up using. Not sure if this would alter the grade much as I haven't attempted it myself. \n\n Beta video can be found HERE.","protection":"A pad or two, the landing zone is pretty safe with he exception of a rock or two. There is potential broken glass hazard as well.","location":"In Thanksgiving woods, all paths lead to this boulder! Follow the trail in from the main parking lot until you come upon the large rock pile (the forest isn't that big).
