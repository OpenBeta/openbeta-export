A split erratic created two mirrored walls, one 10 degrees overhung (East Wall) and one steep Slab (West Wall). The chasm is about 6 feet wide atop and 3 feet wide at bottom. The walls run roughly 20 feet wide.This is NOT yet developed. Lots of rope work will be needed for scrubbing, and for long-term general entry, some sort of bolted rope ladder would be wise. There's no graffiti as honestly few people have the balls to go down there for fear of not being able to get out. At least 4-5 clean lines are waiting on each wall.Message me if you want to help with the development."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:23.740Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:50.497Z"}
