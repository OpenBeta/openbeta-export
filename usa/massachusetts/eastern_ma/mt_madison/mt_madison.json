Some idgit obscurists (edit, of which I am one) will seek it out, since it is referenced in various climbing sources.  Its location makes it probably less-than-perfectly wise to be climbing here.  IÂ’m not sure of the rock type, but it seemed less than ideal conglomerate?  The climbing starts right off the sidewalk and goes up perhaps 40 feet.  Nonetheless, here it is.  It is not recommended. \n\n  I'd the list of folks who have actually climbed this rock is pretty short...no Nobel laureates for sure."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:21.470Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:47.128Z"}
