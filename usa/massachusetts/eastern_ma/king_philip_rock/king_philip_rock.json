Folklore says the outcroppings form some sort of celestially significant layout. It is worth a visit if you live in the area.History of the area: King Philip was the colonial name for Metacomet, son of Wampanoag chief Massasoit who helped the Pilgrims. After the Europeans kept encroaching on native lands, Metacomet led a violent rebellion, King Philip’s War, in which natives attacked almost half of the New England towns (1675 – 78). There’s no proof that King Philip and the allied tribes met or camped at the sites in Sharon that are named for him, but it’s likely that the tribes passed through the area on their travels from eastern Mass. and Rhode Island to central and western Mass. Nearby, but not yet labeled on MP is \"King Philip's Cave.\" "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:21.471Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:45:13.600Z"}
