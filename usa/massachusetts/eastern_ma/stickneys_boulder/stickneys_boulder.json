This side of the boulder has two great highballs on it.  \n\n  Looking at the boulder from the street, the steep right side is the best Stickney's has to offer. This steep wall has holds all over it (almost all of them are chalked up) and the possibility for hard eliminates is infinite. This is an awesome part of the boulder to train on.
