Sit start on the left end of where the slanted crack comes down to meet the ground. The crux is actually middle of the traverse. Traverse right until you gain a huge jug on the vertical crack.

Going straight up on the vertical crack up was V0-/V-easy, so hopefully this adds a little more to the route and makes it more fun.","protection":"A pad for the vertical part.
