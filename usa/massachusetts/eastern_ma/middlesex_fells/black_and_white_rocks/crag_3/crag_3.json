I thought this would be a fun idea to try out, so figured I'd give it a go.\n\n Start at the climber's left edge of Crag 3. Climb straight up the path of least resistance to gain the nice ledge. Traverse the ledge to climber's right, passing a vertical crack, and step down to the next ledge. At the end of the ledge, continue up the ramp that brings you to the \"Perfection\" route crack. Here, exit the ramp by crossing over the \"Perfection\" route crack and onto the slab. Continue traversing right on the slab and crossing over the \"Blueberries\" route cracks. Start trending upwards passing the small, curving crack (tricky gear, I got a black tricam in), and head for the right side of Crag 3.
