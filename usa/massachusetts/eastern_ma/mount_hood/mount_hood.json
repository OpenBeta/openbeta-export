Winter, nighttime, other miscellaneous off hours should keep you out of trouble. It’s a heavily used sledding, XC ski, and snowshoe area in winter, and people walk their dogs here year-round."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:21.470Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:49.861Z"}
