You will find a huge hollowed out area that resembles the interior of a paper wasp's nest. Start matched inside the cave, and work your way out to the front of the prow, over the bulge, and over the ridge.The opening move out of the mini-cave is a little tricky as is getting over the bulge and getting your feet out of the cave. Once you get your feet over the bulge, it's easy, less-than-vertical movement over the prow.
