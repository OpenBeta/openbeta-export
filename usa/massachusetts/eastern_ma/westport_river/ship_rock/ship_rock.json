Shiprock is a granite island, that understandably looks like a giant oceanliner. Most of the Rock is Class 4 and covered with poision ivy, but there are some contrived moderate bouldering problems that can give you a good work out. I really wouldn't recommend going there unless you are planing on going swimming and happen to have your shoes along with you."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:06:20.817Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:46.531Z"}
