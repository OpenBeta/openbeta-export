As you ascend into the chimney, face outwards away from the rock, in order to make it as safe as possible. It is juggy, and you get great feet all the way up, although it is a highball due to the lack of an area for a mat. Top out on the left side of the chimney, if you were to look at it from the ground.

John Sherman got the third ropeless ascent in 1995. The rating is tacitly unstated, but Sherman then called it \"the best boulder problem...in New England\".\n\n Felt like a V4 highball to me. There is a bolt at the top for a top rope setup, maybe 5.12a if you do it on TR.","protection":"Pads and spotters or a top rope. There is one bolt at the top.
