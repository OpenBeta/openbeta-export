It is different in the sense that it is an overhung dihedral/crack on an arete.  SDS on two good holds and move up using the crack only.  Bust out of the dihedral to a large bucket and bulbous feature.  Hand/foot match on the bulb and slap up top for the slopey top-out.  I would say best warm-up or beginner problem in the park, and would easily be worth 4 stars if it wasn't for the boulder right behind the problem.
