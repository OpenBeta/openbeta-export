It is brand new and is just outside of Irvington, WI.    As of now, there is only top roping with two developed routes.    The rock is sand stone and is not up to par with Necedah's quality. It is not crumbly but it is one of the more dirtier climbing areas that I have ever been too. There is a bar at the beginning of the trail to the bluffs.   Approach the bluffs from the top and rap down from main anchors. After climb out and set up a top managed system for the rest of the group.
