The routes are still fairly new, so I would recommend bringing a brush and maybe an old towel.The main boulder is quality sandstone and offers many warmup and moderate routes. There are even more variations than I will post here, but I am sharing all of what I think are the 'true' routes on the boulder.The great thing about this rock is you can more or less climb into any of the other routes at most points in time.With this (and other) sandstone, it is best to wait at least 36 hours after it rains to avoid breaking holds - and for better friction. The routes on the main boulder have been thoroughly climbed and the holds seem fairly solid, but it would probably be wise to avoid any crazy dynos to small holds.There is probably more rock in Wildcat State Park somewhere, but a lot of what I have seen is too sandy and brittle. If you do want to look for new rock, keep in mind that it might not be solid.GPS is fairly accurate but not exact.Here is a video of some of the FAs: youtu.be/Yh5itIuCVgcvq=hd1080-Will M"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":17,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:16.363Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:51:06.568Z"}
