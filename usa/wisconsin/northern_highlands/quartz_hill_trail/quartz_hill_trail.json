If you look, you'll find some crystals but the area is picked pretty clean. There's also a nice view from the top of the rocks. Because this is in the Northwoods, people coming up for weekends means the trail can get busy so be courteous. Keep an eye out for 4 wheelers when you cross the trail coming in. The rock itself is not super long so while there's definitely potential for more routes, there are limits. In terms of animals, keep an eye out for snakes as several snakeskins were in the area. \n\nfs.usda.gov/visit/destinatiâ€¦"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:25.923Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:07.579Z"}
