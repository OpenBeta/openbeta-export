Full of short and medium boulder problemsÂ—everything from one move wonders to 30ft cranks. Some of the areas definitely require some solid spotters because the talus is pretty rugged and it can be hard to find a flat landing spot for a pad."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:25.923Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:07.993Z"}
