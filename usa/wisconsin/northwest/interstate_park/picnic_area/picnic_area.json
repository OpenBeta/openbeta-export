The cracks down low are very shallow, and the mid-section seems dicey.

If you drop your anchor in the slightly worn dish about 18\" left the wide fist crack that splits the prow, your rope will be hanging over the large roof below. This placement still allows you to avoid the roof by skirting it left.","location":"45° 23.7906' N, 92° 39.3351W (reading taken at Picnic Area Face)   This route is about 30' to climber's right (South) and around the corner from the Picnic Area face. From below, look for a right-facing dihedral with a large roof at the top. Above you, near the top, a wide fists crack separates the roof from surrounding rock on climber's left.  \n\n  To locate the top for setting anchors, hike up Riverbluff trail from the picnic grounds and boat launch. Find the prominent tall prow (about 8 feet above the trail) that marks the top of the Picnic Area face climbs. About 30' South of this prow is another rock prow - this one is low, right at trail level. You will see the distinct wide fists crack that splits the prow.
