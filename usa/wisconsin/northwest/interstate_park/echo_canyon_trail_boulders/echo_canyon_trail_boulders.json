Use feet in the roof only. ","protection":"minimum 2 pads and a spotter recommended.","location":"When walking from Lake'o Dallas,  Turn right taking Echo trail (as if your heading to Indian head). At the small swamp/pond to your left, you will see a boulder with a low overhang and a unique crack leading up the face.
