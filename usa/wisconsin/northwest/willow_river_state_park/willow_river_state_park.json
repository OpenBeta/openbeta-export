Nothing too super cruxy just continuous movement with a couple rests, that will all leave you with a dry throat in the end. Begin on 'Dry Lightning' and climb it across the roof lip to where it meets 'Cain'. Continue traversing left just above 'Cain' on a couple pockets that will bring you into 'Couch Time'/'Genesis Effect'. Keep going left into the 5th bolt on 'Natural Selection'. Climb 'Natural' just over the roof to a decent rest then finish off the forearm burning on 'Midsummer Daydreams'.","protection":"Bolts and some long draws will help with rope drag.

Previously an aid line done by Mike Dahlberg, has now been bolted and freed. Crux is for sure the huge roof pull, with one enormous reach, a toss to the lip, and then some technique to finish the roof pull. The start has some rad moves as well but the rock below the first roof is not the best. Some clips are hard to make. Anchors are right above the monkey face, below a small roof. This is the first route that I have bolted (with the help of Jeff Engel and Mike Dahlberg's aid bolts). Enjoy!","protection":"Bolts. Use lots of very long draws.
