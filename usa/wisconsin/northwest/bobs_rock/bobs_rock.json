Millions of years of erosion and glaciers have left the scenic hills that border the southern end of the Marengo Valley and stretch over to the U.P.. Bob's is on the Southeast side of the Marengo River and across the valley from the Old Swedish Settlement trail. It is almost visible from Juniper Rock Outlook. Rumors exist about climbing other cliffs in the valley although none of the other faces have ever been developed. The cliff face is approx. 70 feet tall with some easy to moderate climbing. There are currently four pairs of bolts for TR anchors with an access trail that locals sometimes hike for the view. Locals will also frequent the area scavenging for wild ramps when they are in season and occasionally the parking area will be shared with local fishermen.The earliest ascents claimed at the crag were by Burton Lindquist in the 70s and 80s. The bluff was rediscovered in the late 90s. In 1997 Ryan Eddingfield, a Northland College student at the time scouted the cliff and spent the summer cleaning the face and developing the access trail. Ryan first introduced the name Bob Rock and now it goes by Bob's Rock, or Marengo Creek Bluff. Northland College has been using the bluff for outdoor classes ever since and in 2001 student John J. Roeder developed a short guidebook titled Marengo Creek Bluff as part of a class assignment. The college still has a PDF copy. There appear to be 6-7 original routes established in the summer of 97 although their exact locations and names are a matter of some discrepancy and guess work over the years.EMERGENCY:Â Phone service is terrible to non-existent so plan accordingly. First responders will be local volunteer firefighters and EMTs. The closest hospital is Memorial Medical Center in Ashland.EATS: If you're looking for local fare the Four Corners Saloon is located North at the intersection of Four Corners Store Road and County Hwy E. The food is phenomenal and the drinks are well poured. Friday fish fry and ribs night (I believe on Wednesdays) are not to be missed. The atmosphere draws a pleasant crowd and is one of the few establishments where the local hippy and redneck communities come together. If you're headed South you could try the Lakewoods Resort on Namekagon Lake. The closest bar is the Pioneer on County Hwy D and always promises an affordable buzz."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":15,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:26.602Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:25:20.351Z"}
