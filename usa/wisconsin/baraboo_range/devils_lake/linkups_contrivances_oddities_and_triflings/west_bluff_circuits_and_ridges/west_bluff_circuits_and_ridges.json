The towers are listed below in a potential south-to-north circuit that is somewhat close to optimized for minimal travel time between towers - you may choose to do them in a different order. Virtually all of these towers can be climbed at 5.8 or easier.Thanks to Adam Remus (Remo) for the inspiration and James Mutschler for help compiling the list and climbing with me. There are a few towers on this list that I have not climbed (JM and I did \"15 towers in 15 hours\") - their information comes from the 3rd edition of Swartling and Mayer's guidebook for Devil's Lake. So do the GPS coordinates.","protection":"Standard rack + a couple of leaver biners and webbing.","location":"NAME AND DESCRIPTION                            GPS LAT     GPS LONG   Turk's Pitch 1: (5.2) \t\t                         43,25.039'  089,44.243'   Turk's Tooth: (5.2) [Note #1]             \t 43,25.055'  089,44.275'   Turk's Head: Belly Flop (5.6)\t\t         43,25.055'  089,44.275'   Small Tower above Turk's Head [Note #2]  43,25.055'  089,44.275'   Cleo's Needle: several options [Note #3]\t 43,25.043'  089,44.309'   Tilted Tower: south corner (5.3) [Note #4] 43,25.043'  089,44.309'   The Frigate: several options [Note #5]       43,24.998'  089,44.323'   Cottage Rock - Split Tower [Note #6]        43,25.112'  089,44.268'   First Tower: Big Head (5.5) [Note #7]\t         43,25.138'  089,44.232'   Sun-Top Tower: Sucker (5.7) [Note #8]      43,25.138'  089,44.232'   Great Tower: several options\t\t         43,25.138'  089,44.232'   Prospect Point Pinnacle [Note #9]              43,25.167'  089,44.305'   Reclining Tower\t\t                         43,25.256'  089,44.302'   Hangman Towers area [Note #10] \t\t 43,25.323'  089,44.214'   South Twin Ridge summit pitch (5.6?)\t 43,25.324'  089,44.254'   Knobby Pillar                            \t\t 43,25.321'  089,44.274'   Bird Bath Tower (5.8)                \t\t 43,25.321'  089,44.274'   The Beast [Note #11]\t\t                 43,25.314'  089,44.267'   3 Towers 40' South of The Beast (5.5-5.7) 43,25.306'  089,44.260'   Go-Go Tower (5.7): SE corner or SE face    43,25.341'  089,44.262'   Tower R of Go-Go (5.3)\t\t                 43,25.341'  089,44.262'   Shark's Tooth [Note #12]\t\t                 43,25.352'  089,44.237'   The Porpoise: 5.4 ridge or 5.5-5.7 N face\t 43,25.352'  089,44.237'   Tree Tower [Note #13]            \t\t         43,25.415'  089,44.259'   Tyrolean Tower [Note #14]\t\t         43,25.439'  089,44.246' \n\n  The following notes provide some descent (and ascent) beta for the routes listed above: \n\n  #1: No rap anchors or easy walk-off.
