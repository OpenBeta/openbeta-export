B-minor Mass & Flotsam and Jetsam (2 pitches)3. Balanced Rock Ridge (3-4 pitches)4. Lumby Ridge (3 pitches)5. Turk's Head Ridge (7-8 pitches)The preferred style for The Pentaverate is to start at the CCC parking lot sign, hammer out the four ridges on the East Bluff, run the tracks to the north end of the Lake, grab an ice cream sandwich at the Chateau, bust to the Tumbled Rocks trail, do Turk's Head Ridge, then sprint back to the CCC lot via the West Bluff Trail and South Shore Road. The watch (if you're timing it) starts and stops at the info sign in the CCC lot by the iron ranger pay box.","protection":"Your standard DL rack for 5.6 and below climbing.","location":"The entire park."},"__v":0},{"_id":"QPDxzojmX9qVbAbBcc8t8A==","name":"Half Century Scrambler","yds":"Easy 5th","grades":{"yds":"Easy 5th","french":"1+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.73115,43.41452]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"112217660","mp_crag_id":"111360564","climb_id":"QPDxzojmX9qVbAbBcc8t8A==","areaRef":"9wTg90x0UJSLKmST1g96Mg=="},"content":{"description":"[Also known as \"the old man's birthday challenge\"] \n\nI'm putting this entry here as a place-holder.
