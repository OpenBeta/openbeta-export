Approaches range from 30 seconds to less than ten minutes. Â Smooth Operator, the namesake, is an old school V4, with a high and slick topout. Â Sir Mix A lot and Le Craguette are a mere minute from the car and check in at V4. The Tilted Boulder has a cluster of fun, harder lines and very hard undone projects. Â What Up Weasel is a favorite of the area too clocking in at V7 and has a number of enjoyable problems just next to it. Â North by Northwest is an outstanding and fairly serious V2.\n\nThis area is definitely worth a visit!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":26,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:22.516Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:50.980Z"}
