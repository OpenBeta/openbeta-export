(I haven't committed to this one yet...)The stand start for each of these (from the left hand pinch and right hand juggy sidepull) is also fun and around the V2 range.Note: The talus at the bottom of this climb is pretty unstable due to the slope, be careful! ","protection":"Several pads, the landing is sloping.","location":"Directly across the gully from Tranquility Pillar.
