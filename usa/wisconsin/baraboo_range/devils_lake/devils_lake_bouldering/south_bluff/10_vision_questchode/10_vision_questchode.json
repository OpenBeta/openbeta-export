Since the south bluff has no existing trails(technically) primitive hiking skills should be utilized to minimize impact. the chode is one of the many off the radar bouldering areas uncovered by a few devoted local climbers. the chode is the eastern most of these and offers,hands down, the best slab problem in the park. the obvious lines have been done, but at the most only 10 people have ever even seen the area!! the chode offers some huge unclimbed cave routes as well as the developed slab on the chode as well as some great short steep problems on the east facing walls. In addition to the chode is thye boomtown area which like the chode has seen maybe 10 people ever9besides hunters).
