It likely starts matched on a half pad crimp rail down low. A few powerful moves on perfect edges and horridly small feet leads to an easy finish. It is about 25 degrees overhanging. Edit: Ben Summay has done a V7ish version of this.  See photo for his starting position.  He thinks he maybe could add another move.","protection":"2-3 pads. Full pads fit better than big pads. I moved a big boulder a bit to make the landing flatter. It would be nice to get the boulder out of there completely but I couldn't manage it by myself.","location":"In a small talus field that is a 5 min walk west of \"Variation of I See the Bucket\" (West Post).
