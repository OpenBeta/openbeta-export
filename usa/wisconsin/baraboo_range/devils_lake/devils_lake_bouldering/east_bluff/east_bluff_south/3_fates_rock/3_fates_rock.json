Perfect for the summer to escape the heat and heavy tourist traffic. Negative angle wall featuring plenty of crimps and a small roof section. Landing has some overgrown weeds, but very safe with a crash pad due to no rocks. This area offers a lot of potential to be explored."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:17.452Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:46.473Z"}
