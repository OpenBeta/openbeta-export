Was going to be Tales From Gnarnia, but the approach and landing of this problem makes the name more valid. Anyways, climb the middle of the face starting just left of perth and use all sorts of sharp, painful crimps. I would ask that any future ascents be mindful that the lichen on this boulder make it VERY cool. Please try to not scrape too much off. The view from the top is SPECTACULAR and if the movement was little better, it would be 4 stars no doubt.","protection":"The more pads the better.
