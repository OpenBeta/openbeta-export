Nothing fancy here, just big moves on good holds with a decent landing and a nice view of the lake. This would be a great candidate for a gym rat's first outdoor boulder.The location does leave a little to be desired, but its worth running a few laps on before moving on to harder things in the area. If you do manage to make it off the beaten path, you'll enjoy a ride up the Magic Carpet!","protection":"1 pad.
