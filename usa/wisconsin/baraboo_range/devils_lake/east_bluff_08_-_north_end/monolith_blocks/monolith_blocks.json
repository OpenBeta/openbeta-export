Climb starts by climbing lower groove at wall base center to gain a horizontal fracture and slopng foot ledges.  Angle left here and use small horizontal edges and side pull weaknesses to gain the crux of the climb at the point where the climber passes through the visible small overhanging band.  Gain a sizable flake while moving right towards the route's upper crack.  I think this is a height dependent type of face climb.
