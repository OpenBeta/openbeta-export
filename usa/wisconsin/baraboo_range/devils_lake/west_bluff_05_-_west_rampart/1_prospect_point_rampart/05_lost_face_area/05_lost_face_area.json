The lower moves are tricky and a bit off balance moving up the crack if the climber stays right of the crack and slighty easier and more secure if the climber works up the left side of the crack utilizing a few side pulls off the arete on the left.

You won't need any large gear...Tri-cams and Hexes work the best for me.  When leading there is a great ledge to sit on and anchor off.  The ledge is above all the trees and it has to be one of the best views at the park.  Climb it in the morning.  When the sun is rising it paints the Lake in this awesome glow, plus you get to see a ton of hawks flying just above your head...Well worth the early wake up.  I want to try this variation.  First top rope the climb at the ledge that I mentioned earlier, or lead it.  Start the climb over to the right at this thin crack that shoots strait up.  Then you hit the crux traverse over to the left to the overhang and continue up to the ledge.  The crack to the right is listed as a 5.7 and the overhang is a 5.8.
