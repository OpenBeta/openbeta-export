The 5.7 climber will be well-challenged by the route's initial low crux. However, this toil will be rewarded with excellent climbing on the beautiful, low-angle face above. Even those climbers with more experience should not underestimate the funky body-English required to negotiate the polished holds and finger-locks in the first twenty feet - more than one 5.10 climber has been humbled by the sequential nature climbing here.  \n\n  After the start, the angle, and difficulty, drop considerably. Here, climbers can choose to follow the right-angling crack to a pine tree, finishing on chunky, unaesthetic climbing above the tree. Preferably, and to get full-value from the route, many will head left, working into another crack system where they will enjoy excellent climbing in a beautiful position. All should pause at one of the many comfortable rests to take full-advantage, soak in the amazing view of the valley below, lean back, take a deep breath, look up at the sky and laugh at the world for a few seconds. It is here where, with the sunshine on their faces, many climbers have found the answer to the eternal question \"Why?\"  \n\n  For those hoping to maximize their experience on Peter's, the route offers one more optional (although some purists and the 1970 Climber's and Hiker's Guide call it mandatory) challenge. Having taken the left crack system, climbers will find themselves deposited on a comfortable ledge, where they will encounter another ledge to their left, separated from the main wall by a #3.0 C4 size crack (a long sling is useful here). From this ledge, a two or three move sequence provides a final, but tenuous, upper-crux. The further left the climber stays the more difficult this sequence is.  \n\n  After surmounting the \"headwall\" a move or two on blocky terrain deposits the climber at the base of a giant boulder.

Michael's, like Peter's, has a low crux that leads to easier, aesthetic climbing above. Unlike Peter's, a route that is adored by all, Michael's inspires strong opinions in both directions. Simply put, climbers either love Michael's or they hate it.\n\n From the base, Michael's appears to be an appealing, straightforward crack system, that forms the line of weakness up an impressive wall. But then, from the base, it is easy to look past the start. Reviewing the comments below (or even the entire forum, Michael's Project:  Timeless classic or horrific sandbag?, on the subject) will give the aspirant climber quite an education in the variety of opinions surrounding the quality of climbing to be found at the beginning of Michael's. Almost everyone who has climbed Michael's, will agree that the start is awkward, wide, polished and often slimy. The disagreement about Michael's concerns whether the climbing beyond the start properly compensates the climber for what he or she endured to get there.\n\n Having groveled (and there really is no other word for it, except maybe \"thrutched\") up the difficult, off-width, inside-corner start, the climber can reach back-and-to-the-right, latch a jug just around the corner on the face left of Callipigeanous Crack (continuing straight up the inside corner would place the climber on Kamikaze - a dubious proposition indeed). After establishing on the right-hand face, the climber is richly-rewarded with the route he or she had expected in the beginning. Good holds on the face lead the climber up to where it is possible (and indeed, desirable) to head back into the corner and continue to the top on solid jams. The route finishes in a narrow hanging gully.\n\n In the end, an ascent of Michael's Project (especially on the sharp end) is a rite of passage for all DL climbers. So, grab a rope, a rack, a willing partner and get out there to experience Michael's for yourself. Only then can you add your voice to the cacophony of firmly-held opinions.

The route is in the inside corner to the right of Peter's Project.  Start up the inside corner.  About halfway up you can either stay to the right where the corner gets steep and a little strenuous, or go to a shallow dihedral to the left (about 8 feet left of the corner) where the climing is less steep but also less featured.  A great place to take a beginner.","protection":"Standard Rack","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"JcngfhDVXLiZ0X8TheXGzg==","name":"Algae","yds":"5.4","grades":{"yds":"5.4","french":"4a"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.71365,43.4137]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"107650152","mp_crag_id":"105730107","climb_id":"JcngfhDVXLiZ0X8TheXGzg==","areaRef":"jZDv1XU3Xy2BTYuBfE34wg=="},"content":{"description":"Easy climb up flake and jugs within a chimney.
