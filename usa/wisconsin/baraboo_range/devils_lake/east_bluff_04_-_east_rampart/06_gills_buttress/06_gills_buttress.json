The original name was our way of making fun of ourselves (never miss an opportunity  for that!) for repeatedly punishing ourselves on this thin,complicated, contrived yet independent face climb. Hence the original name, which is also derived from the old saying “glutton for punishment “. Forgive us for our misguided youthful exuberance ! “ He was a very nice boy ,he used to cut the grass.....until he started listening to Zappa and going rock climbing”.The original name has now  been redacted by MP administration . I for one will not look at this as a problem, but rather an opportunity. I am now changing the name of  this climb to “Glutton for Punishment”.Some folks were offended by the original name. Some will be offended by the new name. And some punters will even be offended that I changed the name at all. You can’t please everyone! C’est la vie.My late friend Richard “Prunes” Bechler (prez of Dlfa ) is definitely laughing his ass off from the great beyond over my predicament and current state of affairs.
