Its also a showcase route for the Hawks Nest and starts out on the right side of the wall. This technical face route follows an incipient seam system up a gorgeous swath of stone passing marginal small wire placements and 5.9 climbing.

Aim for the small notched roof before the angle break, and then romp to the top.\n\n This is a fairly serious lead for the grade, and you'll want to make sure you are up for it. The 1979 guide offers this captivating advice if you question your skills: \"Leaders who fall on this climb may go to the happy hunting grounds\".
