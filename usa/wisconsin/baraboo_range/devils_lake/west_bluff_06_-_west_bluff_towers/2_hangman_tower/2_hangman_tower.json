The crack starts out about a foot wide with a flake to the left with a crack in it that takes gear well. Moving up the crack, it gets smaller above the flake and then larger once again. When you are above the flake, you should be able to use a #3 BD cam and some hexes to protect. The crack constricts at the top, be careful not to get stuck here because it is easy to wedge your chest between the blocks.
