The climb tackles a very nice crack on this steep exposure up into a niche then out of the niche exiting right. There is a unique lie back section above where the crack is a bit too small for the average sized hand to jam that takes you up to where the crack ends and the climber is forced to climb left up onto a ledge via a very brutish mantle move (no feet). Above the ledge the difficulty eases way off but the fun factor stays high with neat moves up steep smooth slab but good holds on the rib over and left. Great route I think!","protection":"Take extra cams in the size of BD Camelots .75 to 2 to sew this up.... especially the BD Red.  There is a fixed piton at 1/2 height that looks OK (has a slight downward angle but it's a big angle piton) and a fixed cam just above that looks still OK.  The mantle move is protected with the smallest TCU or 4Cam (OO) or Zero in the horizontal at the back of the ledge.. you can get in a couple and both deep.  It's quite the exercise to hold on and place em though...","location":"4th pitch variation of the route \"Turk's Head Ridge\" on the north exposure of this buttress.

Turks Head Ridge, with the Wiessner Wall finish is seven to nine pitches long.  Sure the pitches are short, but its all we've got.  \n\n  To approach, walk north past the cabins on Tumbled Rocks Trail until you can see a tower about 50 yards above the trail. This is the first pitch (5.3).  Descend the tower, and continue on long, mostly unbroken ridge to the base of Wiessner Wall.  Continue up Wiessner in two pitches and complete the longest route in Wisconsin. \n\n  Pitch two (5.6), an ugly wide inside corner, protects well with big cams. The third pitch, a left slanting finger crack is the crux (5.8) and difficult to protect.  It is short, though, and the 5.6 face to the right might afford the leader some respite. After this, it is 5.4 climbing to the top. \n\n  For what it's worth, I have usually climbed the ridge in this order: \n\n  Pitch 1: The Tower, 5.2  \n\n  Pitch 2: The Dirty Inside Corner, 5.6  \n\n  Pitch 3: The 30 Foot Wall, 5.8 or 5.6  \n\n  Pitch 4: The 15 Foot 5.1 Groove  \n\n  Pitch 5: The 40 Foot Inside Corner/Ridge, 5.4  \n\n  Pitch 6: The short Rightward Diagonalling Crack, 5.4  \n\n  Pitch 7: The Double Cracks, 5.5  \n\n  Pitch 8: Wiessner's Chimney, 5.4  \n\n  Pitch 9: either Wiessner's Face, 5.7 or The Crack Above The Tree, 5.2 \n\n  I feel as though, when climbed this way, you maximize both the quality and the quantity of the climbing.

Lots of green colored lichens either side of the crack but doesn't effect the climbing one bit.

There is a nice face hold just left of the crack edge that helps to reach past the flared portion and to reach a great right hand ring finger lock with a just barely usable opposing thumb push (makes the lock a bit more solid).  There are two possible finishes- one tops out on ledge to left at top, the other climbs through steep crack and broken rock to higher ledge over to right.  The right hand finish makes the climb longer and more fun.","protection":"Except for the first 10-12 feet (pro is smaller and more marginal here) the whole climb protects beautifully and bomber with wired stoppers, tricams, and TCUs or cams (all in small to large finger size).","location":"Located on steep face down below western exposure of Turks Tooth"},"__v":0},{"_id":"X2d5Lp1SX2y7HASQt7xodw==","name":"Belly Flop","yds":"5.6","grades":{"yds":"5.6","french":"4c"},"fa":"Old School","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.73802,43.4176]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"107504975","mp_crag_id":"105730146","climb_id":"X2d5Lp1SX2y7HASQt7xodw==","areaRef":"jX4RULIEUO+iX+2RbHThtg=="},"content":{"description":"The route has exposure and protects well.  \n\n  Description from Sven's guide: \" Northeast ledges and overhang.
