A V2 off width problem to start , a V1 layback problem to start, or a stand start that still goes at 5.8.  \n\n  Either way, once past the initial start, the crack is wide and it goes to the top. Some mandatory 5.8 off width was required here. We thought it was enjoyable, and I even threw in a foot stack or two.  \n\n  Unlike most DL off width cracks that are surrounded by blocky ledges this was legit crack climbing.\n\n (INFO on original boulder problem below)   This problem is super fun, and is one of a kind at the lake. OW roof crack problem, which we found best to climb feet first.  \n\n  Starts on juggy flake inside crack.
