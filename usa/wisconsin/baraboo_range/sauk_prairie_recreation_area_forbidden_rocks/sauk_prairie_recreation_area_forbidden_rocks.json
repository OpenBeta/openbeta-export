There is a 20-25 foot wall and several boulders. Great area to hang out for the day.The rock here is unique.  It is formed from shattered Barabook quartzite, that was tumbled and then re-cemented together with quartzite sand.  This matrix then mostly metamorphosed, formed a really solid chunk with an appearance similar to a conglomerate.Figuring out how to climb the routes and problems here is an experience much like learning to read Braille - your sense of touch is just as important as your sense of sight.  Enjoy!For most of the decades there has been climbing at Devils Lake, this area was either private farm land or the Badger Ammunition Plant.  Only recently was the Ammunition Plant de-commissioned and divided between the Ho-chunk Nation, the USDA, and the WDNR.  As such, there is little climbing history here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:16.361Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:44.698Z"}
