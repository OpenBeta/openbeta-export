Donald who gave it to the state Department of Transportation, and two surrounding acres, in 1952 as a scenic wayside. The \"wayside\" was closed in the 70's due to vandalism, but it is included in the now Donald Park trail system (Dane County Parks). There is a geocache stashed on the top of this rock.Wrap blocks for top roping carefully. Two 30 ft webbing straps should be sufficient for nearly all anchors.
