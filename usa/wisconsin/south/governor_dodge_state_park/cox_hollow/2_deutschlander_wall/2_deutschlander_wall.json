There are a handful of routes and some hard bouldering opps tucked in below the base.   \n\n  There are a couple options for easier top ropes on the left/middle side of the wall, while the hard lines are on the right. \n\n  This is a beautiful little area to spend a day.  The summer months, of course, will be a lot noiser than those of fall.  If you are bouldering well there are some very difficult problems to clean up a bit and do.
