Before I broke my wrist, actually. It was a great way to get back into the game. It's the face with the death landing. A low crux leads to a thin, really sketchy slab. The slab includes a mono, a few holds that broke multiple times while cleaning and working, and some really skimpy feet. Needs more traffic, but I'm not sure that will work out. It cleaned up to be one of my favorite problems in the Dodge. As classic as most climbs of the same grade and danger in Bishop in my opinion. \n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=I_5hi7iâ€¦","protection":"I left my pad at home on accident.
