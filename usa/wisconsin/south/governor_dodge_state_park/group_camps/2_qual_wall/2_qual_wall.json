To start, climb the somewhat chossy chimney/inset to a good ledge in the left chimney near The Nordwand.  This is where the climbing really begins and becomes quite good.

And keep slapping, heel hooking, and toe hooking until one can reach the perfect jug at the top of the block.

Slick Willie was president. The Macarena was sweeping the nation. The internet was a torture device. And the U.S. sport climbing scene was still in it’s wild and rebellious adolescence. After a six month road trip of some the best sport crags in the nation at that time, Seth and I came back to Wisconsin with a whole new perspective on life. A Red Recollection was the first line we established here for obvious reasons, and it is named after the Red River Gorge, which I thought had the best sport climbing I'd ever seen.\n\n The line climbs the center of the wall up a unique \"tufaesque\" layback feature for thirty feet with awesome non technical stemming.
