It has a number of better quality lines that take you to the top of the tower, but these are flanked by a bunch of questionable rock. Most of the lines take good gear, but it is also possible to set up tree and gear anchors at the top for top-roping. The easiest way up is a short 5.4 line (Saddle Up), from the high point near the back of the tower. This formation doesn't get climbed much, and some of the lines can get fairly mossy. Helmets recommended all round. All routes are trad/TR - there are no bolted routes here, and the park does not currently allow new bolting."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:27.885Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:58.891Z"}
