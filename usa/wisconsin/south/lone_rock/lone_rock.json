These offer a good half day addition to ice climbing at Governor Dodge State Park, which is a reasonably short distance to the south.\n\n Access is very quick - less than 100 yards from the car.  After a long cold spell it is possible to walk to the base on the river ice, but think twice before you do this.  The river currents create thin spots, and I have seen someone soak a leg by breaking through.  More often people access the various columns from above, either lowering and belaying from above, or rappelling in.\n\n At various times this has been considered a good place to get out and climb by headlamp."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:16.361Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:25:09.449Z"}
