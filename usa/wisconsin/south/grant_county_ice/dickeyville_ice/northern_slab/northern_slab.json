The top of the ice is a ledge densely packed with trees that are 1\"-3\" across. You can sling the trees (or rap off them), or push your way through them for more adventure.  \n\n  Above the ledge, you can climb a couple of 15 foot \"rock\" steps on crumbly sandstone - more sand than stone - followed by a 60° snow slope that climbs almost 100 ft to the top of the road cut. You can walk off left at the top, towards your car."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:16.840Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:45.553Z"}
