These are all about WI4 or harder, and do not have a walk off. Except for the one route (Tree's Company) where you can sling a couple of trees at the top, you will have to rap off of v-threads. The road cut itself is close to 200 feet tall. If you join two ropes, it might be possible to TR with anchors at the top."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:16.840Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:08:57.214Z"}
