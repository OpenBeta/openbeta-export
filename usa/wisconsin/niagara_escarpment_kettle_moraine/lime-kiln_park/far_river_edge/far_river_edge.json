There is a slight overhang on most of the wall. Also, there isn't a large landing area and the area is right on the water, so the water level of the river will also play a factor unless you don't mind getting you and yourself wet/ muddy. The ground is also pretty much completely rock, so I heavily suggest bringing a pad or more."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:26.602Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:57.852Z"}
