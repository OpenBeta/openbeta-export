There in the shade lies a sporty and bouldery mix stretching horizontally almost 100 feet.  This pumpy ledge resting in the shade reaching 15 to 20 feet gives any climber a chance to hop around on some rocks.  Leaving the hands hot and ready to climbing more, this bantam sized bomberish blissful beauty beneath the trees,\\ breathes a batter of pockets, edges, and side pulls that delivers a little bit of everything.  Sitting a stones throw and then some north of The Tower at UW-Green Bay gives this spot easy access.  Run up the trail to The Great Wall, park at The Tower or at the BP and easy access to this rock awaits you.  Having chalk and brushes never hurts, and a crash pad probably isnâ€™t a complete necessity.   - Be sure to check out Big Ben, it's only a few hundred feet away!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:25.923Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:42:56.855Z"}
