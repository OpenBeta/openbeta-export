A long way back while drilling for rock they struck a natural spring and the quarry filled up with clean water great for swimming. Through the years different companies have opened the quarry for swimming, with waterslides, boating, fishing, rafts etc. The south side of the quarry has great cliff jumping and 20+ ft walls. Lots of opportunities for DWS."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:25.925Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:25:19.623Z"}
