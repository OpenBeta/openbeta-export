Buckle up, this ledge is one heck of a ride.  With close to 200 feet of horizontal rock, and many different hand holds, it takes a skilled climber to deadpoint this from one end to the next.

After using some DJ Snappy skills on the over hang get ready for some stretching and squirming for the last half of the rock which is always a good time.  With only mild moisture after rain falls this rock sits dry and ready to fly.  With a mixed bouldery feel and solid rock its an adventure waiting to be ceased.  Tucked away just of the UWGB Trail in the woods makes access simple.  Park at the BP Gas Station or at The Tower and walk south onto the trail a couple football fields.  Then cut in towards the road and Big Ben the peacefully princess of the pines will be there ready for you.   - Be sure to check out The Great Wall, it's only a few hundred feet away!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":9,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:25.923Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:07.962Z"}
