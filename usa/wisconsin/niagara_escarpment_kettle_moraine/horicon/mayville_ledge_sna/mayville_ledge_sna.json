The cliff gets higher the more north you go until heights of nearly 80 feet but the bottom of the ledge is on private property... \n\n  The rock is much like the adjacent Ledge county park. It can be extremely crumbly in some areas. Very dirty. Also reminds me of High Cliff State Park (which makes sense because its on the same geological formation). \n\n  Be careful! This place was originally owned by Mayville Limestone before acquisition by the state. Since then they have not removed the barbed-wire and no trespassing signs... but as long as you use Google Maps you'll have no issues."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:25.925Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:25:19.613Z"}
