It is 15 ft of quality vertical climbs.  \n\n  It faces the sun in the morning so it is a good spot to boulder in the winter because the snow will melt. \n\n  Sit starts are usually always hard in this area (but not impossible).  \n\n  The climbs range from V0 to about V2. But they are all fun with precise footwork needed. Top outs are also possible but can be challenging because of all the choss at the top."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:27.125Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:09:09.015Z"}
