Start sitting at the bottom of the steepest part of the corridor and climb directly out tiered roofs. The right wall is most definitely off.  \n\n  The Overhang was attempted for years until a small block was pulled off with hand pressure. The removal of this block created a hold and allowed this problem to go. For a while, the block still sat at the base, and it was possible to put the block back in, thereby making the problem much, much harder. It was sort of like two for the price of one. These days, the block is long gone.   \n\n  This is a classic problem on good stone with a worthwhile top out.
