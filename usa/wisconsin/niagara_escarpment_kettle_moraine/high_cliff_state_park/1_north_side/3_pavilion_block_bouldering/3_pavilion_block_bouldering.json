Most established problems start on either side of the long, low roof. The left side of the wall is quite tall and generally unsuitable for bouldering, though The Traverse of the Gods climbs across this section.  \n\n  The leaf-filled corridor is also included in this area and can be found about 100 yards east of the block. The problems are shorter and provide high quality bouldering with good top outs.  "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":24,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:34:27.125Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:25:20.394Z"}
