Clip up then take a load off and sit on the large boulder. Contemplate your existence and consider all the decisions that have led you to this moment. When you feel ready to move on, work out a rail and into the first crux, getting established over the lip. Recompose yourself and fire a long move to the next lip and into the second, even harder, crux. Once through, pull the 3rd and final roof and into a rad dihedral finish.","protection":"6 Perma-draws to Lower offs.","location":"Only route on the Triple Roofs wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,b33d5a8f-4494-55c0-a863-049dce4065d9,7171ecce-25fb-5d6f-8043-884ba05e379b,c01da0e1-65e1-5934-aef1-f885ee0e4100,717c9350-67d0-5889-82ef-0a88955d90b4,723b49f5-f456-537f-ac99-f52ed5d8ea11","pathTokens":["USA","Arkansas","North-Central Arkansas","Cowell/Deer Area","Haunt Hollow","Triple Roofs"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12c"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.28301,35.8966]},"bbox":[-93.28356508364692,35.896150339818135,-93.28245491635307,35.897049660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120124400","area_id":"cjtJ9fRWU3+smfUu1djqEQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-93.28356508364692,35.896150339818135],[-93.28245491635307,35.896150339818135],[-93.28245491635307,35.897049660181864],[-93.28356508364692,35.897049660181864],[-93.28356508364692,35.896150339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":"3 roofs.
