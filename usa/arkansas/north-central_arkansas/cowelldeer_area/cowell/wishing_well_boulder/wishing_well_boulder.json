The rock looks suspect but is actually pretty solid (I spent some time on rappel yanking and yarding on these guys to make sure).\n\n note, you can sit start a more direct line, but it's not that interesting and adds nothing to the problem. there is potential for a sit start and line to the left of this one, but it would have to meet up with this one and share the ending.","protection":"plenty of pads","location":"Middle of the giant boulder's beautiful face, start on the obvious huge jug around chest high."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,b33d5a8f-4494-55c0-a863-049dce4065d9,7171ecce-25fb-5d6f-8043-884ba05e379b,c01da0e1-65e1-5934-aef1-f885ee0e4100,50bf9489-bc59-59a4-8934-2e6c3fda1ab6,3f6ef840-e332-548c-886e-b5e18dfffb72","pathTokens":["USA","Arkansas","North-Central Arkansas","Cowell/Deer Area","Cowell","Wishing Well Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"},{"count":1,"label":"V5+"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.13338,35.83759]},"bbox":[-93.13393467046555,35.83714033981815,-93.13282532953447,35.83803966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"114607457","area_id":"P274QOMyVIyIbrXhjf/7cg=="},"content":{"description":"This is a massive boulder tucked into the woods, surrounded by some semi decent other boulders.
