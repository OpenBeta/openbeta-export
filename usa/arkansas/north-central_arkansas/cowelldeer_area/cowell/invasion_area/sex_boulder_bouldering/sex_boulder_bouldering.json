Best to use the Fennel guide to find it. But I'll give you an outline: From Cowell on Hwy 7, take Cowell Rd (1204). Dirt road. 5 miles in, you'll see 1204C branching left. Take that, and park perhaps a quarter mile down in a little gravelly/rocky turnout on the right. Hike back half way, and look for a cairn leading downhill (on your left hiking back toward  1204). Steep downhill hiking, then sneak through the huge chimney between the boulders. You'll come out in a little area with Electralica (v5-6, 4 stars) on your left, and Ab Lounge on your right."},"__v":0},{"_id":"+CPiu9+AWZe3MdRI/EzOMQ==","name":"A Dream Come True","yds":"V6-","grades":{"yds":"V6-","font":"7A","vscale":"V6-"},"fa":"Patrick Weldon","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.13015,35.87129]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"112391897","mp_crag_id":"112448401","climb_id":"+CPiu9+AWZe3MdRI/EzOMQ==","areaRef":"X2z4IJ5uVuqOCCLHNzisJA=="},"content":{"description":"Move from obvious holds and pasty feet to a big crux move landing you a horizontal crack, followed by two reaches on and off sweet pockets.
