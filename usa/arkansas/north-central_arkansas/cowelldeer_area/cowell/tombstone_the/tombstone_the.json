It is perfect for those trying to escape the masses at HCR or Sams. The name comes from a small cemetery that is located near the parking area above the cliffs. Until recently, most of the routes were traditional climbs established in the early 1990’s. Now there are several new sport and trad lines that make Tombstone a great area for a small group or a weekend trip. Also note, a high clearance vehicle is needed to access this area or you would have to hike approximately 2 miles from the invasion campground.  \n\n  The Tombstone is located on a rocky peninsula that points almost due North (with climbing on the east and west sides), so you can chase the sun or shade depending upon the time of year. To those with small children and dogs, the standard approach involves down climbing or rappelling, so use the fearless approach."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":15,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:23.644Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:18.337Z"}
