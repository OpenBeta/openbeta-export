Great potential for high-quality traditional lines.  Be aware of your impact in this area.  At the cliff-edge, walk left about 50-75 foot to find a scramble down to the base of the cliff or rappel in.  The sandstone is very competent and bomber for amazing gear placements.  No power drills allowed ever."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:20.896Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:09:05.839Z"}
