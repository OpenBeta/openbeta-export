A good assortment of boulder problems and a handful of roped climbs exist in this secluded zone. The area is a work in progress with development ongoing.

Bouldering is all around the area with a few established problems existing but little to no information about them. The routes are on the furthest downhill side of the area where there is a nice bench to loiter on. WARNING: This area sits down range from HCR's shooting facilities. The typical times for their shooting activities are Monday mornings and Thursday evenings. Exercise caution and common sense when heading to the crag and avoid completely if the range is active."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:20.897Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:28.406Z"}
