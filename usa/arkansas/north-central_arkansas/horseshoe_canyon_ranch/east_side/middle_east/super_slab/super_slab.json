Kudos to Jason Roy and the rest of the ranch climbing staff for putting this fine route up and doing a particularly thorough job in cleaning it. This 5.8 face climb is highly sustained at the grade, and the movement is very thoughtful yet wonderfully flowing throughout. It is also fairly unique in that it is almost two different and yet similarly moderate but sustained and excellent face climbs in one. Climbing to the immediate right of the bolts on subtle and angled but positive recessed jugs has one feel to it, but climbing to the immediate left of the bolts produces a totally different feel on a cool collection of more technical slopers and crimps. Left may be the slightly harder (8+/9-?) path, but it is debatable. A final mantel brings you to the CW anchors.
