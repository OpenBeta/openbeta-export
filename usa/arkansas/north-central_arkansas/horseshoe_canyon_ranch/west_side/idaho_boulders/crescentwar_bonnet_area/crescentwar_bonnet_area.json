Traverse into the tricky lower crux that is managing some slopers and sticking the arete. Once you finagle your body around the arete, you'll find yourself compressing through some crimps out left and that comfortable, tacky corner. There will be a rest jug about 20 feet up, and one last long lock off blocking the deep sigh of relief that awaits you on the chill topout. ","protection":"Multiple pads and spotters","location":"This is located on the far opposite corner of the same giant boulder that the popular War Bonnet V5 holds. To approach, walk from The Loaf Boulder hangout area to and past War Bonnet and then through the triangular arch that reveals The Crescent V3.
