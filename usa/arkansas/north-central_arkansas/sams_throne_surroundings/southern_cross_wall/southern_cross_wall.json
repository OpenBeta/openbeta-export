The overhanging limestone faces south and catches the sun afternoon and early evening. This climb starts on overhanging limestone pockets then heads out and over a roof bulge to a steep upper face. I used a pink .05 tricam for extra protection in one of the roof pockets during the first ascent. A two bolt rap anchor available for a clean rappel.","protection":"Quick draws, pink .05 tricam, and standard rap anchor cleaning gear.","location":"Head down the water drainage, south and down hill from the Throne. An old forest road and faint game trail gets you close to the creek. The creek then cuts through the sandstone and down through the limestone to form a seasonal waterfall. Down climb the shoot which brings you to an undercut ledge area. Southern Cross starts on the right wall, on the left side of the overhang. Do not walk down to the lower section or you have gone too far. Top rope is possible off trees above but are located on a very steep slope."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,b33d5a8f-4494-55c0-a863-049dce4065d9,7171ecce-25fb-5d6f-8043-884ba05e379b,a6e462e0-3c37-5660-a80a-91fb088a1f2d,659c4b29-dd26-5656-9c48-a3db3e508912","pathTokens":["USA","Arkansas","North-Central Arkansas","Sam's Throne & Surroundings","Southern Cross Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-93.05393,35.8655]},"bbox":[-93.05448486573816,35.86505033981813,-93.05337513426178,35.86594966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"112406762","area_id":"ZZxLKd0mVlacSKPbPlCJEg=="},"content":{"description":"Overhanging limestone, directly down hill, south of the Throne, between White Trash Wall and the Deliverance ridge.
