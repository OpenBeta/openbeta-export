Jim Karpowitz climbed this in the 80's with no fixed gear, and no pre-inspection. \n\n  This is the spirit in which 90% of the routes at Sams have since been sent.  Last year, a rash of rap and retro bolters descended on the Throne spraying bolts, and opinions on anything within gunshot.  \n\n  I knew it was a matter of time before they got to the green face. It's the most obvious remaining gem. Luckily, they left it untouched. I  headed up with a small rack and figured out the \"creative\" gear placements; worked the crux, and came back two weeks later for the send.  \n\n  This is how \"the game\" works at Sams, and hopefully will for a long time. Time moves slower here, and someday, someone will do the direct green face.
