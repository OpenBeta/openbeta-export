The top half is a beautiful arete, one of a kind at Sam's. This route is historically significant for two reasons. It is the first fully bolted line at Sam's and it is the first sport route bolted by Clay Frisbie, Arkansas' most well known developer. The one downside is that the route does not actually begin until you step off the ledge and straight into the crux at the halfway point. You can place a #2 Camalot at the break on the ledge to protect a ground fall if you are not comfortable making the next clip. Follow the arete until forced onto the right face. Work your way back left from there until you reach the aptly named \"thank god,\" jug. Find a knee-bar rest at the last bolt or just rocket through to the chains.","protection":"5 bolts, optional #2 Camalot.
