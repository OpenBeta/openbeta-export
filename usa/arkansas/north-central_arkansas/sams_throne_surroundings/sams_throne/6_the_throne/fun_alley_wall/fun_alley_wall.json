The crux is near the top when the angle starts to get steeper, and it revolves around a somewhat hollow, blocky flake.  A small cam will fit behind this flake, but a fall on it would most definitely dislodge it, so probably don't do that. most of the rest of the rock on the route is bomber.The anchors are no longer equipped for lowering. Hopefully this will get fixed in the future.  The route is a popular top-rope as it is easy, and the anchors used to be easy to access.  Accessing them from the top now is definitely still doable, but would be very scary.","protection":"Standard rack, leaning toward the small stuff with a few spots for nuts.
