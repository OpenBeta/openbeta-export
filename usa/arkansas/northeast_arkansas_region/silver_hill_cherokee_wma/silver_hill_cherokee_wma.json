This area has what I'm guessing is the Witts Spring Formation (Prohibition and Bikini Beach) sandstone. Worth exploring. The main chunk of stone can be found in a small valley between Silver Ridge Rd and Dug Hill Rd. There are also many good options for deep water soloing where this tract of Cherokee WMA meets Greers Ferry Lake and becomes Army Corp of Engineers Land. If you are between the lake and white \"+\" on trees you are on public Army Corp lands."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:25.777Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:21.149Z"}
