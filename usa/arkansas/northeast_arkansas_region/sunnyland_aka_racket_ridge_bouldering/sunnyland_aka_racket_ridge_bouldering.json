When the gate is open, it is possible to drive right into the middle of the cluster and park. This true boulder garden contains several dozen house sized boulders and at present, is choked with briars and blackberry brambles. Be prepared to clean boulders and do some trimming of prickly vines.I found this area circa 2015 driving on a reconnaissance trip and never found the opportunity to make it back. I maybe explored 25% of the boulders because the thorns were pretty intense. Bring some tools for cleaning and be prepared to develop a virgin boulder garden. I've been sitting on this for 1/2 a decade and feel the public should learn of this place. Hopefully it will get the development and the traffic it deserves!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:18.113Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:27:24.293Z"}
