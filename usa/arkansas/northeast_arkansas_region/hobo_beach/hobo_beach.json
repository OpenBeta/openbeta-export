Landings are flat and sandy, just keep an eye out for the glimmer of broken glass or the occasional hypodermic needle. Holds are fine grained texture and soft on the skin. Hobo is a great way to warm up if you have some off the radar projects lurking in the greater Batesville area or you're a local looking for a way to circuit and get stronger on some steep stone.There is some discussion over what exactly in the hell the formation is. Generally, it has been accepted as the Batesville Sandstone but there are some arguments this may be something different entirely.Either way it's here and you are interested in climbing. The rock feels (and sounds) soft and hollow but it is surprising resilient. Surprisingly, holds are rarely known to break."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":20,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:25.778Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:56:21.623Z"}
