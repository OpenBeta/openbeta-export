Home of Darcy's Law (one of the most classic hard boulder problems in Northeast Arkansas)The most concentrated circuit area in the Gasfields - everything tops out here. Bring some brushes, clippers, and loppers to rehab the area since it's been nearly a decade since anyone last climbed here. If you keep an open mind, what you'll discover here is a strange Arkansas proxy to Horsepens/Font style fine grained sandstone on slopers and compression. This will never be a long distance destination but it is a great training zone (especially for those living close by) to have for climbers in the North Eastern/North Central parts of Arkansas. This area can get a lot of sun in the winter time but with the nature of the cave provide shade throughout the day and the cave can also be very sheltered from the wind and conversely, fairly shaded in the spring and fall during leaf-on. The Cellar has been posted on 27crags.com (27crags.com/crags/the-gasfi…) for nearly a decade but it doesn't seems that very many people have ventured into these boulder gardens since the first ascensionist (circa 2011). Assume boulders will need to be recleaned but it'll be worth it and you'll have these little zen gardens of public land all to yourself to session your heart out and finger tips off!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":28,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:52:26.711Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:39:13.110Z"}
