The lake (shaped like a wish-bone) is generally surrounded by hills on all sides. The roads leading into Lake Lincoln are mostly winding county roads. These roads, with lake access points on the N and W sides of Lake Lincoln, allow for a timely movement of casualties to surrounding medical facilities.
