Move up and left to gain a good stance on the slab below the first bolt. From here, a highly technical sequence on very small feet and barely useable hand holds leads to a decent flake at the halfway point. From here another tricky and technical sequence on small crimps leads to good holds at the lip. Move slightly back right along the lip to reach the anchor. This is a true technical slab testpiece. It is very sequential in nature, requiring accurate foot placements and lots of tension. It climbs like two stacked boulder problems with perhaps the briefest of shakes between the two. The clipping positions are tenuous and there are few opportunities for chalking.A highly aesthetic line that has outstanding movement on superb sandstone with two incredible rail features. The position and setting of the climb is special, as is the opportunity to climb directly over water. A nice change of pace in a state best known for its steep climbing. Important note: If you fall before clipping the first bolt, you will fall into the lake. It may be wise to stick clip this bolt. Additionally, since the belay platform is so far to the side, it may be necessary to anchor the belayer in order to prevent them from being pulled into the water during a fall.","protection":"3 bolts (with an optional 4th bolt) to a 2 bolt anchor","location":"This climb is located on the Ripples Boulder on the side that faces the water.
