Casual climbing at the start leads into a crux section with some committing moves as the holds decrease in size and the wall steepens to near vertical. Topping out the route can be a bit tricky but if anchors ever get added then that won't be a concern. Top out and build a tree anchor just a few feet back from the edge. There is even a perfect, chair sized boulder to sit on while you bring up the 2nd.  \n\n  This would be a good beginner lead as the crack offers good stances while placing pro and the crack accepts a good variety of gear. We found that the route seems to have been made for hexes as they slotted in the crack in textbook placements.","protection":"Cams up to a #3. Bring some hexes, you won't regret it. Tree anchor.","location":"Hike past the Rhyme or Reason wall and follow the trail as it dips down away from the cliff.  Keep hiking for about 3 mins and you will be able to see this obvious crack on the only section of cliff tall enough for a route.
