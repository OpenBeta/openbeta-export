At this time, it may be easiest to rappel in due to the difficult terrain at the base of the cliff. Follow the bolts up the continuous slab to an awesome layback feature where the angle steepens. A few more techy moves and a mantle guard the anchors. At this time the key holds are clean, but the route as a whole is very dirty, be prepared to do a bit of scrubbing. If it were a bit cleaner, the route would gain a star or two!","protection":"5 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor w/rings","location":"Once at the overlook area, look to the north and you can see the slab in its entirety.
