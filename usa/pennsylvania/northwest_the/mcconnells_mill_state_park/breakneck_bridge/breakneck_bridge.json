Commit to a good undercling to gain the slab with a crack in it. Chuck a piece of gear in if you can find a placement. I gave it PG-13 because if you can’t find a placement here, the next good gear isn’t until you continue up to find a great horizontal crack at 15-20 feet up. From here continue up towards the short dihedral. The crack in the dihedral takes nuts and passive gear well. Layback and stem your way up the dihedral, and find a dirty ledge up high that allows you to exit the dihedral. Continue up using roots and whatever else you can find to top out.
