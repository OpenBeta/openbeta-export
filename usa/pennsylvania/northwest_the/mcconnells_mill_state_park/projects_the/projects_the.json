Missing the last move means a solid whipper. Very overhanging so relatively safe to go for broke. Would recommend taking a couple of extended draws to make clipping positions more efficient. Also when cleaning don't pull the last draw or you'll send yourself and the belayer flying off into the woods like some redneck cirque du soleil acrobatic nightmare.
