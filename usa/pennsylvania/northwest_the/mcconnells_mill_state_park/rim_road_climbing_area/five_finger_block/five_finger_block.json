The rest of the block can be bouldered with numerous variations and top-outs, some bad falls and a pad is helpful. Head to the north end where a small boulder sits on a ledge for easy down climbs or to set up a TR. This is a great place to warm up or for beginners.

A cheater block is often placed for the start of this climb, feel free to move them out of the way and enjoy the opening moves. The rest of the route is straight up with solid large holds.
