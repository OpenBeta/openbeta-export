I'm not a PA local and it was clearly climbed a lot as there was chalk on a lot of it, sorry I don't know the name. There were several fun easier routes here and one harder one. If someone has names for the boulder or routes, please update it. I'd say it's generally V1, except 'the hard route' #4 starting right hand on the right edge of the west side.  \n\n  The crux for the north face (what I marked 1,2,3) is near the top simply because the holds are a little smaller. The west face sit starts were kind of hard too for us as novices, but standing starts were easy to get going and fun still."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:57.477Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:26.353Z"}
