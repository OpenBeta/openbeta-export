Most good boulders are within the first 100 yards of the entrance, although they don`t stop there. This was apparently once an established area, with a few top rope, or highballs depending who you are. Ive been trying to restablish the area without much luck.

Please try to leave the area you`re in cleaner than when you arrived (not a hard task if you pick up atleast one piece of trash). Theres a popular hang out a little ways down the trail that people call the jumping rock where you can swim during the summer (trash gets heavy in this area, be forewarned).
