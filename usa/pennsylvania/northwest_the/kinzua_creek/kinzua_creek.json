Amazing conglomerate with some crazy little features all over the boulders. Around 20 boulders, possibly more. An incredible amount of problems that could be set. Easily accessed from Route 219, and on National Forest Land. Perfect place for a little getaway, with Kinzua creek less than 100 yards away and some great fishing. Only warning could be about bears and a lot of rainy weather. Just use common sense for both."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:57.466Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:23.281Z"}
