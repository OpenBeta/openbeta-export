Very well placed bolts for clipping positions. Crux is the last move, can be accomplished via intermediate or one big dynamic move. Chains have surface rust but are solid, probably a good idea to rappel rather than lower off to save your rope. Once a leader sets up the anchors it can be top roped to work out the moves.This route was originally done as a boulder problem which goes at V1 R.","protection":"Sport","location":"See the topo picture for location, it's the only bolted route on the Little Chief Boulder"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,a9036599-b208-520e-91c8-b2fa0cf34056,e2f6f352-3b81-58aa-9e33-3750d8dbf239,491dc1bf-d039-5c17-a848-3f6c52b6c5dc","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","Northwest, The","Indian Rocks","Little Chief Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a/b"}],"byDiscipline":{"sport":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.81622,41.34874]},"bbox":[-78.81681898592622,41.34829033981814,-78.8156210140738,41.349189660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"121837659","area_id":"SR3Bv9A5XBeoSD9sUrbF3A=="},"content":{"description":"This boulder is located diagonally next to the Chieftain Boulder housing many PA Highball classics."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:58.052Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:26.640Z"}
