This tall, alluring face has been contemplated by every visitor to the Stables, since the late 1970's or early 1980's I would imagine.  It is the most obvious project at all of Governor Stables, partly due to it's proximity to the entrance, and also the fact that it is the proudest line on one of the best boulders.   \n\n  Start off of the flat rock at the base.  Begin on the good holds in the horizontal crack.  Move up to a solitary sidepull, then somehow span the five or six foot blank vertical face to the top of the boulder.  The only feasible way to work this project would be with a top rope, because it is a tall boulder.  The grade is merely a guess, as I had to put something to enter this into the database.  The problem does not seem that hard upon first glance, but believe me, it is a very long reach from the good sidepull to the lip of the boulder, and it is very sloping as well.  Someday, someone very tall may complete this problem.
