Stumbled upon this area while doing woodcock surveys, thus the incredibly appropriate name and road that this area is on. Good mix of bouldering and top rope, with no anchors as this is a brand new area. Needs more scoping to determine possibilities of trad and top-rope. \n\n  Does not seem like this would be a crowded spot being out in the country. Rock is quite clean already and free of moss, felt sturdy. Most of the bouldering routes are on a significant slope which one could accidentally tumble down from a fall. No camping opportunities in this area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:55.868Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:51.449Z"}
