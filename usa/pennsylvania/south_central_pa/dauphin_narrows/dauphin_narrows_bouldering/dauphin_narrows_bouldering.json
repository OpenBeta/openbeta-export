But there is only a little bit of solid, appealing stone. Therefore there's only a handful of problems because there is A LOT of exposed, weak rock that I have found to be dangerous (adding to the danger is the shit landings that are all around on this steep hill/ridge side). \n\n  Landings here range from totally safe, to if you fall you are likely to roll all the way down to the tracks.  \n\n  This is NO major area (like Mount Gretna, Whiskey Springs, Governor Stables, Coll's Cove, etc). I'm appreciative of the small amount of quality stone/problems that is here.  \n\n  Enjoy and please apply effort to leaving no trace!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:58.946Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:55.931Z"}
