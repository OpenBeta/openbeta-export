Clip the ring hanging over the lip of the roof then pull the roof and follow three more bolts through highly featured vertical terrain to a two bolt anchor. For full value and better climbing, stay on or just slightly left of the bolt line after the roof. In my opinion this climb is really a move or two of 5.10 at the roof surrounded by easier climbing. Note: Do not climb past the anchors, nothing but frightening choss.","protection":"7 bolts on route. 2 bolt anchor with rings to lower off.
