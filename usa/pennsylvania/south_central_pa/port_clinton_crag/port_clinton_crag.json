Start at the far south corner of the crag and work the dihedral up to the small ledge just to the left of the face.  Transition out from here onto the face and climb up the center of the two crack system.  Handholds are limited, but all there.  Continue up about 10 feet, using a left hand side-pull around the corner and a pointy flake on right (crux).  After moving through crux, continue up another 10 feet and traverse right towards base of chimney.  Continue up and through chimney to walk off (top rope can be set with gear and long webbing/cordelette).  Be careful of loose rocks.","protection":"Protection is all there, although difficult to place with limited rest positions.  Set of C4s up to #2 and medium sized stoppers should suffice.  Red C3 was all useful for pro before the traverse.","location":"Start at the far south corner of the crag"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,f1d4db42-c5d2-5c85-9aa8-1e5c69928c04,8ff183fb-afd3-5e3e-8e2f-173e1d212106","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","South Central PA","Port Clinton Crag"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.0233,40.5739]},"bbox":[-76.02389199488849,40.57345033981814,-76.02270800511151,40.57434966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107165364","area_id":"j/GD+6/TXj6OLxc+HSEhBg=="},"content":{"description":"This is a small rock outcropping located off of the Schuylkill River Trail (John Bartram Trail)in the town of Port Clinton, PA.  The crag sits along the old railroad bed, which is now the trail system.  The main part of the face is slightly overhanging and provides for a relatively forearm pumping experience.  As of my first trip climbing here (6/7), it didn't look like it had been climbed before.  Be careful of loose rocks and dirty cracks.  Protection seems to be okay, but many of the routes would be quite challenging lead climbs.  Toproping should be possible for most lines- be sure to bring a rack to build an anchor.  If rocks come off, be cognizant of people passing by on the trail.  It gets a lot of use from hikers and bikers."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:58.942Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:27.914Z"}
