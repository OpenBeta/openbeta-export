Pretty straight forward problem.  \n\n  If you use 100% traditional offwidth technique (knee locks, hand stacks, heel to toe camming, leavittation techniques, etc) it is harder than V3. If you use mostly offwidth technique but use some of the face holds it goes around +/- V3.","protection":"Three pads for me to feel comfortable.","location":"Down the hill (South) of the Main Wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,f1d4db42-c5d2-5c85-9aa8-1e5c69928c04,b5cb1c74-5019-568d-a15b-3d312df56a20,6a482601-b4e0-5129-8f5e-bf872c72be3d,a4157923-d9f3-5bc9-ad86-8c3c0fca9bee","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","South Central PA","White Rock Acres","White Rock Acres Bouldering","Bubba Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.08831,40.13197]},"bbox":[-77.08889812791739,40.131520339818145,-77.08772187208264,40.13241966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108158887","area_id":"pBV5I9nzW8mthow8D8qb7g==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-77.08889812791739,40.131520339818145],[-77.08772187208264,40.131520339818145],[-77.08772187208264,40.13241966018186],[-77.08889812791739,40.13241966018186],[-77.08889812791739,40.131520339818145]]]}},"content":{"description":"This pyramid shaped boulder is home to Bubba the offwidth roof crack."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:58.942Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:55.520Z"}
