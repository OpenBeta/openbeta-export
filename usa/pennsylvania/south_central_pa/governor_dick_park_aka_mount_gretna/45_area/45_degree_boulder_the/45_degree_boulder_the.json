Two obvious holds are the only features on the 45 degree wall, the first boulder one encounters on the walk into Mt Gretna.   \n\n  Not quite 45 degrees, this problem begs to be climbed.  Begin on a sharp right hand undercling and the three finger pocket for the left hand.  There is a large foot to start on.  Heel or toe hook the ramp on the right and move up to the gorgeous slopers at the lip.  It is possible to go with either hand.  Topout on the Fabulous finishing rail.  It will  help if the conditions are sticky. \n\n  There is a great video of the first ascent on the 2001 film Hard Gret.  Dynamic movement on finely grained slopers makes this a must do.
