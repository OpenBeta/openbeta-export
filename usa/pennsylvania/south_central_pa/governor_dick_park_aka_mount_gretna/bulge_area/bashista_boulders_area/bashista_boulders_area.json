To send this climb specific beta is what you KNEED.  \n\n  Sit start or squat if you cannot reach the starting holds. Start right hand in a good single pad undercling and left on the sloper rail. Move up the narrow block compressing with your whole body until you hit the good hold on the lip, from here climb around the right side of the block to a tough top out. \n\n  This would get 4 stars however, the close proximity to the rocks on either side make it less than classic because of the dab potential. \n\n  Also apparently on the FA it was topped out fairly straight on but that feels very contrived and after talking to several locals the new standard and most natural line is to top out on the right side. When I climbed it I found this to be the most natural way, topping out straight up takes away from the quality of this great line.","protection":"A couple pads ad spotter.","location":"From 'The Box' walk up the hill and to the right, pass 'The Bulge' and when you pass that boulder look left into a corridor and you will see this line."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,f1d4db42-c5d2-5c85-9aa8-1e5c69928c04,b143faf5-2192-5e09-9610-3020af408b1f,4ef5021e-611e-5254-821c-f2db40141f99,83ea484a-a374-5e72-854f-47193bcdc6ae","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","South Central PA","Governor Dick Park (aka Mount Gretna)","Bulge Area","Bashista Boulders Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V8"},{"count":1,"label":"V5"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.45356,40.23912]},"bbox":[-76.45414905763855,40.23867033981814,-76.45297094236143,40.23956966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116187446","area_id":"g+pISqN0XnKFT0cZO83Grg=="},"content":{"description":"Bashista Boulders."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:00.077Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:12.187Z"}
