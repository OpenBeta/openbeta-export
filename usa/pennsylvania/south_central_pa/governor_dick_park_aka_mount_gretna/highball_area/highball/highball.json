Gretna.  It climbs the subtle sloping lip of a steep roof and in true diabase style; surprisingly finicky and technical despite the severe overhang.  A testament to Chet's ability to envision problems from seemingly unclimbable features.   \n\n  Start sitting on the rail.  Heel hook and head for the triangle shaped hold, which is more of a feature than a hold, that you will utilize for both hands in the near future.  This problem will work your right hamstring.  Get established on this hold (will help if it is cold and not humid), match with a gaston-ish meat wrap grip and make a dynamic move to snag the two and a half finger crimp.  Now you need to attain the sidepull/crack/fingerlock thing with a go-again.  A tiny foot lies far under the overhang for the left foot to aid in the transition between crimp and crack.   \n\n  The crux is over, toe hook the left foot on the starting rail which will allow you to hook your right heel over your hand (probably the only time I have ever had to do this on diabase) to grope the right hand up your choice of a blank wall around the corner or a sharp arete, aiming for the apex of the arete with the top of the boulder that forms a nice pinch.  A right knee scum is possible.  Pull around the right face, traverse the lip and topout.  This problem has been done as an eliminate without using the crack and is most likely V9 that way.     \n\n  Trickle in Time is the problem that almost everyone considers the benchmark for V8 at Mt. Gretna.  It is a problem that feels impossible until one works out the subtitles.  In optimal conditions with low temperature and humidity, this problem feels easier. (in my opinion it could be a sandbag V6 at one or two granite bouldering areas I can think of).  A guaranteed full body workout.","protection":"A pad or two, it will help if one is thin due to dab potential.","location":"Not in sight of the Highball boulder.

It is certainly the most serious highball in all of Mt. Gretna.  Joel Brady caused quite a stir among us locals when he completed this long eyed project during a visit around 2004.  Not only is it incredibly highball and proud, but a pointed rock lies embedded in the ground directly underneath the fall zone.   \n\n  Start standing and climb up to a flat jug on the corner around ten feet up.  Take a deep breath, then begin the horrifying journey up the next fifteen feet through rarely traveled terrain.  The right face is flaky and not the best rock quality.  On the plus side, it is peppered with tiny flaky edges.  The upper portion appears to utilize the arete for both hands in some spots, and the left hand on the arete with right hand on edges on the right face in other areas.   \n\n  It would be prudent to clean the rock on toprope before attempting, as I am certain the climb has not been tired in quite some time.  Better yet, work the boulder on a top rope before bouldering it out.  Think of it as a headpoint.  Or the best idea may be to skip this climb and move on to a problem that will not risk broken ankles or worse.   \n\n  If you send this boulder, you have serious street cred in my mind.  I imagine it has seen only a handful of ascents in the ten years after its first ascent.  The Brady Arete is one of the most risky undertakings that I have seen out of all of the diabase areas, save for a few of Char's creations at Haycock.
