Cam the right foot into the bottom, wide part of the crack.  Lean left and reach high to hook your right middle finger into the mono.  This hold is not so much of a mono as a tooth for one finger.  Left foot on the most miserable foothold imaginable.  Stand onto it and reach high left hand to where the crack offsets.  Begin strenuous, delicate laybacking to the topout.   \n\n  The mono is notorious for injuring fingers, and I worry that if my left foot would skate off the smeary edge, one could lose the finger.

Work your way into a position where you will be spanning between the arete and crack with your hands and no feet.   \n\n  Hike the left foot up to nearly nothing, perch for all you are worth and reach up high left to a tiny, nearly unusable sidepull.
