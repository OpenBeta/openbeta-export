It is the northern extension of Rocky Ridge that lies on your left when you bear right to head towards the main Hunter's areas. There are no trails, but unless it's the dead of summer the underbrush isn't too bad. Most of the rock here is dirty and in need of cleaning. The rock is less densely spaced than at the main Hunter's area, and there are sections of stratified sandstone that are too loose to climb on. However, if you're willing to do a little exploring and some cleaning there are quality boulder problems to be had along the ridge."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:56.302Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:22.168Z"}
