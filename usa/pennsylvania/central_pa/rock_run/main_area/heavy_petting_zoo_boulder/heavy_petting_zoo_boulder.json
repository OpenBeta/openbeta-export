Nice holds and very interesting and cool movement. Video beta: https://vimeo.com/243213836\n\n Sit start on two not very obvious crimps (see video for clarification) with a pretty good foot. Climb into the stand start and then go out left to a super cool pinch and top as the stand. \n\n The first ascent was done by matching the first hold you go to (the better of the two crimps used for the stand start). I did it with some rose move beta that improved the quality for me, but also forces you to stray slightly off route. Both methods seem about the same grade. ","protection":"a couple pads to avoid bailing down the hill","location":"Right below human pony girl."},"__v":0},{"_id":"5X60orZ8WTuMF3oRN+5qWw==","name":"Wailing Wall","yds":"V9","grades":{"yds":"V9","font":"7C","vscale":"V9"},"fa":"Brian Harrington, 2011","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9382,41.5061]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"111035366","mp_crag_id":"111018588","climb_id":"5X60orZ8WTuMF3oRN+5qWw==","areaRef":"gGY2TJG3X6m0cSIUviwAfw=="},"content":{"description":"Starting on solid crimps (one is two fingered) move up to a pinch and then the top out","protection":"Pad(s)","location":"Far left of Heavy Petting Zoo's main face; start is a few feet left of Human Pony Girl"},"__v":0},{"_id":"dS9i1qWyU2mVdBo9AAJd6w==","name":"Unicorn Princess","yds":"V9-10","grades":{"yds":"V9-10","font":"7C+","vscale":"V9-10"},"fa":"Brian Harrington, 2011","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.9382,41.5061]},"left_right_index":2,"mp_id":"115352475","mp_crag_id":"111018588","climb_id":"dS9i1qWyU2mVdBo9AAJd6w==","areaRef":"gGY2TJG3X6m0cSIUviwAfw=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start same as wailing wall sit.
