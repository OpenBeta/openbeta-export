This is the only boulder found in this area (plenty in Rock Run as a whole) but it is worth visiting due to the setting and that the boulder has 5 distinct climbs on it. Perfect for a mid-day retreat. Climb and have lunch next to the waterfall! \n\n  The crux to the sit start is the 2nd/3rd move. After repositioning higher up on the starting left hand rail make a big move to a sharp jug with the right hand. From here make another large move with the left hand to the arÃªte (sidepull). Reposition feet, drop the right hand into the sidepull closer to the middle of the climb and move on through the stand start up obvious features. \n\n  The setting is great, the climb is fun, but the starting foot is high and the second food is a bit polished.  \n\n  I feel it is a v5 or v5+ (I've seen v6 for the sit on other sites as well as v4+). I give it this rating because I struggled with the high foot for the start. A more flexible person may rate it lower. A long reach helps. Regardless, it is a very fun climb in a setting not often seen in PA.","protection":"1-2 pads is sufficient. Careful of the boulder to the right of the sit.
