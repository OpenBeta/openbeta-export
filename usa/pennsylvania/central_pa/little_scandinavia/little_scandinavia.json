There are multiple faces along the cliff. Around 50ft in most places. The rock in some areas is pretty crumbly and hard on the hands. Good trees for top-rope anchors at the top of the cliff with easy access from around the sides of the cliff. \n\n  At this point only the large bowl-like section of the wall on the far right (when facing the cliff) has been climbed. There are 4 established routes there. Still a lot of unexplored climbs at Little Scandinavia! \n\n  Will be putting up photos showing the 4 established routes soon."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:55.867Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:21.209Z"}
