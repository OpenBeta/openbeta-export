Since then it has become the second bolted route here at Donation and designed for the beginner sport climber. Bolts are many and close. Clipping stances are solid and accommodate shorter climbers. A great route to experience and gain confidence in sport climbing!The crux is getting up and over the slab next to the bigger of the two trees growing right out of the rock - between bolts five and six. Use the tree’s trunk at first if needed but aim to not use it eventually. Don’t go too far right on the slab though as it becomes much harder. Stay as direct as possible.","protection":"Seven Wave glue-ins to ClimbTech hooks for easy clip-in and lower-off. The new safe standard for sport climbing.
