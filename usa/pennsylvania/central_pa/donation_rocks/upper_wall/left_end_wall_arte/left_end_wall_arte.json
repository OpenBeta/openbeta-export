It’s short, almost like a high-ball boulder problem, but a lot less risky by way of top rope anchors above. Those anchors will accommodate all three routes so tie in to them accordingly. The .7 is the prominent jagged arête at the right end of the north face. The .9 is the arête downhill from that and finishes on the west face. The 8 is the north face. Try and complete the Triple Crown by doing the 7,8,and 9 in a row without a fall or untying.","protection":"Anchors at top","location":"North face and arête"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,127b5393-2e00-5b5b-a3a8-6f90ec643563,6bf8cbc2-6fbc-5ead-a50e-b55d892620f5,70beb842-7b03-5ae7-b670-f3f318090e10,79f63a20-3fca-5b13-a13e-90a9b8954ef4","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","Central PA","Donation Rocks","Upper Wall","Left End Wall & Arête"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.9438,40.5743]},"bbox":[-77.94439199842759,40.57385033981814,-77.9432080015724,40.57474966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119051486","area_id":"efY6ID/KWxOhPpCpuJVO9A=="},"content":{"description":"Currently the only developed part of the Upper Wall.
