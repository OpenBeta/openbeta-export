Here reading the rock and balance are key. There are holds here but you gotta look closely and be able and willing to plant and trust your feet. Many climbers rely too much on their hands and on their upper body strength. Listen, your legs are way stronger and your climbing shoes contact the rock on a molecular level! I preach feet - find good feet and your hands will thank you!\n\n Very Thin is a short but fun route that is another Donation classic.

An all time Donation classic! Thin offers you TR (top rope) as well as Trad (traditional). It’s a sweet little thin line up Africa Wall that you gotta do and will enjoy.\n\n Start it wherever you like - some approaches are easier than others so test yourself and try a harder start each time. Anchors for this are on top of The Buttress and are the wide-set glue-ins to your left when on top. You will need two double length slings or a standard cordelette to make it out over the edge with your biners. ","protection":"Anchors on top","location":"Main Wall: Africa Wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"G7Eil3kmUziB0vcBU8IOEA==","name":"Killer Whale","yds":"5.10+","grades":{"yds":"5.10+","french":"6b+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.94374,40.57332]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"118064249","mp_crag_id":"118007201","climb_id":"G7Eil3kmUziB0vcBU8IOEA==","areaRef":"FajA945OXK6ZhwL4yBnmWw=="},"content":{"description":"I put this route together because I wanted to make something that featured the other side of the giant pointed roof above The Flake. I discovered the left side a few years ago while working its length and up the arête - similar to Barber’s Roof. There’s a huge pocket that I could put both my hands into as I moved out to the point. It was only later when I was setting up for another climb did I look over and see that it looked like an eye and that roof could be the head of a whale. The climb as a whole is pretty killer taking into account the Africa Wall part which is sparse to begin with and the traverse out and up the whale head arête. Hence the name Killer Whale.\n\n Your start may vary but I like to tackle the little overhanging wall at the bottom vs. the easier approach to the ledge below Africa. Once there stay on the far right of Africa Wall. Top out there and proceed up to the whale head. Move your hands out and into the eye while anchoring your feet below. With your right hand, reach out and grab the nose. Break your feet loose, find new feet, and dead point up higher with your right. Once locked in high, pull up, get your left foot in the eye and stand up. Now up and over. Just like that. ","protection":"TR for now.
