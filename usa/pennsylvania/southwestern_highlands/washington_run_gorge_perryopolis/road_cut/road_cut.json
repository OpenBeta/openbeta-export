Fairly easy, mostly crimpy climbs. What makes this wall stand out is the incredible friction of the rock. Looks like sandstone, but it grips like conglomerate. The wall itself is man made, where they blasted for a road, and not very steep. Great for warming up, plus there's a pull off about twenty yards away from it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:55.881Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:51.558Z"}
