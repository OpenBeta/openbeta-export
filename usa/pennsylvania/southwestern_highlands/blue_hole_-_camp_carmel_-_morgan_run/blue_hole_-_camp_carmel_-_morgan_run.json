The information on this page is for reference only.A nice secluded spot with a variety of bouldering and top rope problems. It is mostly wooded and shady, but the main wall gets a lot of sun near the top, especially earlier in the day.The top of the wall is just about ideal for setting up top rope, with lots of large sturdy trees for anchors. Also recommend following the trail to the top overlook point, where there is a very nice view of the valley.Nearby is the (now closed) \"Blue Hole\" swimming hole, just across the dirt road and downhill from the climbing."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:04.019Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:16.791Z"}
