It only has two faces that are full of cracks and good holds. This area is good for new climbers, but is also good for those new to rappelling. There is a large ledge to back off of and it is a short wall, making is easier to learn how to rappel. The bolts are on top of the large boulder at the top of the rock, so there is a short climb to set the anchor. This is safe as long as you are careful.Â "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:03.550Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:00.841Z"}
