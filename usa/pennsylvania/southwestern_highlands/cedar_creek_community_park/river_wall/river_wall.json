About 35 foot high wall, with a fairly blank, less than vertical face. Good for slingshot top roping, all though scrambling to the top is an adventure in and of its self. Your best bet is climbing up on the left end of the cliff where a few trees grow up the side. For the most part, it's very good solid sandstone but has some shale underneath the overhang. Overall just a fun little place to play around. Takes a long time to dry however."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:04.527Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:17.546Z"}
