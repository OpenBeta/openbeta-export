Home to several clean cracks, potential for trad climbs, and a 50 foot tall freestanding block. Incredible quality rock, with several amazingly aesthetic areas, including a highball situated next to a crevice which gives birth to a spring. So far, this is the only extensively explored area in the Wild Area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:04.011Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:01.533Z"}
