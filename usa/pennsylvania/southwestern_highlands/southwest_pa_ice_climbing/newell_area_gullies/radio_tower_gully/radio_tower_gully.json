It has two waterfalls at the top, before the two gullies merge, that are about 8 to 12 feet tall. At the bottom, there are two waterfalls stacked on top of each other, for a total height of about 25-30 feet. This area receives sun for the end of the day, and has a spectacular place to watch the sunset from at the top of the bluff.
