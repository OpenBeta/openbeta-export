Its close proximity to the car and fine selection of moderates make it a popular weekend spot for local ice climbers.  Conditions can be checked from the Meadow run parking area which is situated directly across from the flows.  Climbs range from NEI3 to M8 with a little in between for everyone.  Most climbs are easily toproped from the large trees above.  Access to the cliff top is left of the main ice flow approximately 150yrds at the lowpoint in the rockband (usually a small steady stream flows over the rock at this point)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:04.007Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:16.916Z"}
