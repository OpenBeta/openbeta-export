Home to the notable highball boulder problems Finders Keepers and Wide Awake Nightmare, the very committing mega highball Astral Travelin', as well as a number of stunning double digit projects. There are also a couple high quality V0-1 problems, and a few excellent lines in the v5-6 range (Vlad and Founding Fathers), as well as a few other decent moderate lines in the v2-v4 range--enough to keep easy- to moderate- climbers interested for a day or so, but probably not much beyond that. There are about 8 short, stout sport routes, also, generally of average quality, with the exception of one stunning bolted line that would be v14-ish if you didn't need a rope (but you do). Because the terrain at the rocks is quite rough and the boulders are concentrated, there isn't a lot of room to move around, and the main zone probably can't handle more than 10 or so people at a time. Apart from the main zone, there is a) the corridor as you walk in, with perhaps 7-10 moderate but lower quality problems, the deep Pit below the main stuff holding another 5 or so problems, and some more average quality lines down below in the forest to the left (opposite direction from the Pit), which can help folks spread out. If the parking is crowded, consider going back down the road to the Pyle, a.k.a. Falls City Pub boulders. The Proving Grounds is heavily hunted at times (and there is a tree stand on the hike out). Wear orange/consider going elsewhere during hunting season--the first day of hunting season in particular typically sees about 15 hunters out and about. Rattlesnakes have been spotted on top of the boulders along the ridgeline, but not, to our knowledge, down among the boulders or on top of the established problems. Use caution."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:04.006Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:01.361Z"}
