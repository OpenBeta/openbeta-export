Climbing up it includes climbing through at least three separate rock layers, each about 20-40 feet in height. The first layer is a type of limestone and the last layer is a type of sandstone, but I'm not sure about any intermediate layers. Potential here for a multipitch route, but be careful of loose and sharp rock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:04.526Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:17.287Z"}
