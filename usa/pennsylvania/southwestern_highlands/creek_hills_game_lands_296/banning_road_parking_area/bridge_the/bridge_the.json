This is a large railroad trestle who's legs can be climbed very easily in a variety of manners. Around 120 feet in height, all steel (?) beams. For safety's sake, please rap off rather than trying to walk down the length of the bridge. This bridge is over a thousand feet long, way longer than it takes to lose a foot race with a train. Just use common sense."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:04.526Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:33.269Z"}
