Throw to good holds along the top of the boulder. There are plenty of foot options for those who like to smear or throw in heel and toe hooks. Once both hands are on the main horizontal crack in the boulder, throwing the right hand to a high sharp crimp will be the crux. Tall climbers will be able to skip this intermediate crimp and should throw their right hand in to a slightly farther jug just past the crimp. Rock over the high right foot and reach up to the last two top out jugs to stand up.","protection":"1-2 mats.
