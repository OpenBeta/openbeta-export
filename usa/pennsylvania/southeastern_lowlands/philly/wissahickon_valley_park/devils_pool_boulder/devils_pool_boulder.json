Follow the crack up and right where it flares out. The crux is getting from the flare to the upper lip of the boulder and there are two ways to go about it. Either make a reachy dynamic throw to the lip, or calf hook into the flare and use an undercling to wrestle your way into an insecure heel/toe cam then reach for the lip. Either method is very committing and having a spotter would be very nice psychological pro. The topout is easy enough but not a \"gimme\" so exercise caution as it would be a nasty fall coming off of the top.","protection":"1-2 pads and a spotter","location":"On the face of the Gritty boulder above the \"swimmer's rock\""},"__v":0},{"_id":"ecOErYieUMuqoouo8Jt0NA==","name":"Unknown Undercling","yds":"V6+","grades":{"yds":"V6+","font":"7A","vscale":"V6+"},"fa":"Rich Shoemaker","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21479,40.05154]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"120153853","mp_crag_id":"116112949","climb_id":"ecOErYieUMuqoouo8Jt0NA==","areaRef":"/q1ITaUKWKSGZH+CEJwwLg=="},"content":{"description":"Starting on the far right of the front face, traverse left to the sloping crack until you reach the start of \"Unknown Herb\", Finish on \"Unknown Herb\".","protection":"pads, spotter.","location":"Devils Pool Boulder"},"__v":0},{"_id":"qGPzyaHYVNmyvQs6+HQ5pQ==","name":"Shouting at the devil","yds":"V7","grades":{"yds":"V7","font":"7A+","vscale":"V7"},"fa":"Josh Newman","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21479,40.05154]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"120153827","mp_crag_id":"116112949","climb_id":"qGPzyaHYVNmyvQs6+HQ5pQ==","areaRef":"/q1ITaUKWKSGZH+CEJwwLg=="},"content":{"description":"Start in the prominent crack that \"Wrastlin'\" follows, but climb straight up the face and out left.Â ","protection":"1-2 Pads, Spotter","location":"Middle of the Devil's Pool Boulder"},"__v":0},{"_id":"+fSEvPUzWXutqS8wuzdS3Q==","name":"Potpourri","yds":"V2+","grades":{"yds":"V2+","font":"5+","vscale":"V2+"},"fa":"Rich Shoemaker","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21479,40.05154]},"left_right_index":4,"mp_id":"120153795","mp_crag_id":"116112949","climb_id":"+fSEvPUzWXutqS8wuzdS3Q==","areaRef":"/q1ITaUKWKSGZH+CEJwwLg=="},"content":{"description":"Climb the arete on the far right of the boulder up to the alcove, and follow up to the top.","protection":"1-2 pads, spotter","location":"Right arete of the Devil's pool boulder"},"__v":0},{"_id":"/hgjadRgVtOLBCnS/6oERA==","name":"\"Unknown Herb\"","yds":"V4-","grades":{"yds":"V4-","font":"6B","vscale":"V4-"},"fa":"Rich Shoemaker","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21479,40.05154]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"120153876","mp_crag_id":"116112949","climb_id":"/hgjadRgVtOLBCnS/6oERA==","areaRef":"/q1ITaUKWKSGZH+CEJwwLg=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the juggy left crack and climb straight up","protection":"1-2 Pads, Spotter","location":"Left side of Devil's Pool Boulder"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,c557f60c-fdc4-50a5-a046-ee2be8ec0b64,5d7ade9a-3475-5436-a34b-1d241b3bd143,e4ba1160-1b38-55fd-8e04-1b06c3480fee,fead484d-a50a-58a4-8664-7f82109c302e","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","Southeastern Lowlands","Philly","Wissahickon Valley Park","Devil's Pool Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V6+"},{"count":1,"label":"V7"},{"count":1,"label":"V2+"},{"count":1,"label":"V4-"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":5,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":2,"expert":2}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":2,"expert":2}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21479,40.05154]},"bbox":[-75.21537743331487,40.05109033981814,-75.2142025666851,40.05198966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116112949","area_id":"/q1ITaUKWKSGZH+CEJwwLg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-75.21537743331487,40.05109033981814],[-75.2142025666851,40.05109033981814],[-75.2142025666851,40.05198966018185],[-75.21537743331487,40.05198966018185],[-75.21537743331487,40.05109033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is a boulder embedded in the hillside, typical of Wissahickon Valley Park.
