This boulder has some nice climbs and may have first been climbed by Rich Shoemaker but very large flakes have broken off the bottom since. A bit chossy! There is also a slab climb around the left side of the boulder which i haven't done. For this boulder a walk off all the way to the left is possible but a bit annoying. I downclimbed as far as I could before dropping off a few feet to my crash pads."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:03.085Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:00.219Z"}
