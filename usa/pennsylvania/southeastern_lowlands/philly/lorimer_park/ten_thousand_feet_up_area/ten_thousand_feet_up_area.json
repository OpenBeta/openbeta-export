This route begins V-easy and ends V-hard (but I usually climb with ropes so I'm not that familiar with bouldering grades. Open to suggestions.) Start standing on a coffee table size rock. Pretend you are standing on a ledge ten thousand feet up. Proceed through the easy Orangutan/Jungle Traverse, which is an excellent warm-up. Stem through the dihedral. Throw a calf up and around the corner and step up high to keep things easy or stay low around the corner for a challenge. Down-climb or stay low to continue traversing through some wide reaches until reaching another good resting spot. Breeze through a long easy section and then take a rest before the cave. Continue into the cave, being aware of the sharp boulder under your back. Climb up and out of the cave to the right, watching for loose blocks. Try to gain a comfortable stance and rest as if you are ten thousand feet up until you are ready to do it all in reverse!","protection":"","location":"There is a coffee-table-sized block at the beginning of the area to step off of."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,c557f60c-fdc4-50a5-a046-ee2be8ec0b64,5d7ade9a-3475-5436-a34b-1d241b3bd143,5864fa08-a60b-5c67-b70b-152088b7c2f7,01d3dc57-c9ba-535e-a565-c6a0f28115d8","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","Southeastern Lowlands","Philly","Lorimer Park","Ten Thousand Feet Up Area"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V-easy"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.07102,40.09945]},"bbox":[-75.0716078467338,40.09900033981813,-75.07043215326622,40.09989966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116365425","area_id":"AdPcV8m6U16lZcag8oEV2A==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-75.0716078467338,40.09900033981813],[-75.07043215326622,40.09900033981813],[-75.07043215326622,40.09989966018186],[-75.0716078467338,40.09989966018186],[-75.0716078467338,40.09900033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is a pleasant, shady, area.
