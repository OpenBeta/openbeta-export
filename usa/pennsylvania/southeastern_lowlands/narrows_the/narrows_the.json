This area is filled with 400 foot high Brunswick Shale and has reliable routes. There is convenient parking which offers practically no approach. If it happens to snow a lot make sure to bring a shovel to get into the parking lot. Over the winter, this summer choss pile turns into a pretty great place considering it's in PA, but still be careful, theirs still plenty of loose rock.  \n\n  The three most popular and most reliable routes are, Main Flow, Main Gully and Dead Deer Gully."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:00.096Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:57.161Z"}
