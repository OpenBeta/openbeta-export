There are 32 trad routes that were led ground up on gear and a few pins. Mel Hamel, Tom Moffatt and I , had our run of the place, and climbed the lines we could with the gear we had at the time.The original sequence numbers will be a little difficult to use as we always approached from the downstream end (climber's right), but the upstream end (climber's left) is used now.Only four climbs had fixed gear at the time, between 1981 and 1983, two each in the area behind the Great Wall, one pin on Fruition and one on Thunder Road. In some cases small cams which were not available at the time may allow ascents of climbs where the pitons disappeared, but use some care, particularly on the Rotwand, as we were in deck territory every time we went out the the nose to work on getting some gear.As I understand it, some routes have been bolted on the Great Wall. The most common center route on this wall has been led on gear at 5.8 X. We did some other routes that were pretty bold, and I am concerned these would get bolted unknowingly. If you are planning to bolt more routes there I would appreciate any opportunity to fill you in on existing trad routes there.Buttresses and routes, from upstream to downstream.Rotwand* The RotwandGreat Wall* EB, Phone Home* Great Wall Nose* Great Wall (center trad line)* Great Wall right variationLeaning Pillar* Pro-found* Right Hand DriveButtress 8* Strapaducktome * Bondage and DisciplineButtress 7* Don Genero* Would I?* HarelipButtress 6* Three Stooges Go Climbing* Thunder Road* Simple SoloCentral Buttress (Buttress 5)* Monster Mash* Tryin' Times* Stop the Presses* Central Buttress Direct* Knuckle Sandwich* The Nose That RoaredButtress 4 is short and has no routes.Buttress 3* Shattered* FlatteredFruition Buttress (Buttress 2)* Limburger Groove* Self Cleaning* Fruition* TuitionButtress 1* Dead Men Don't Eat Roughage* Mel's Route* The Tongue That Swung"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":25,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:00.097Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:29.846Z"}
