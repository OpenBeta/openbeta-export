A great place to train finger strength as most of the holds are good but small. In my experience there are no loose stones in this structure however that is subject to change. Some of the holds may have some crumbly mortar on them that needs brushing off. Landings are generally good and this makes for a good spot to get in a large amount of climbing on small holds without roping up. Be cautious as there is a metal rebar structure within the stone walls that shows in some isolated spots, but overall is not a concern."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:00.097Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:12.081Z"}
