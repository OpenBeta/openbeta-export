If so, then this is the line you'll want to check out. Interesting moves lead you out this cave. If you refrain from researching the beta, you'll have a fun time trying to decipher the odd yet fun moves that will lead you to higher ground! \n\n  Start in the back of the cave on a flake and work your way towards the prominent notch. Figure out how to get around the lip and up through the little chasm. Hit the final seam and revel in the fact that you just did some acrobatic moves to get there!\n\n The easiest way to get to this problem is by coming from the Caves. Once you hit the caves, go around the backside and scramble up along the talus. Under My Thumb is about 150 yards uphill. Its somewhat hard to spot.","protection":"2-3 pads.
