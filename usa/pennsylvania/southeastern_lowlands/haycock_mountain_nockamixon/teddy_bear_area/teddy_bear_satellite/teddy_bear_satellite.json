The top will almost always have to be cleaned off and the same will have to be scrubbed from all the debris that built up from no one touching it for months (or years). Despite the fact that its unnamed and only a v3, its a rather fun line nonetheless.  \n\n  SDS in the pit. Left hand on a low but good crimp and right hand in the seam. Work your feet and follow the seam up to the lip. A few tension moves and good foot placements will see you hitting the lip and doing the fun topout. Just try to avoid the vegetation that has grown a few inches thick on top of this one!","protection":"2 pads.  \n\n  Because this one starts down in a pit, like all other things at Haycock it gets a bit bunchy at the start. Its somewhat hard to pad the start, but once you pull on, you'll be up over a larger block which is easily padable.","location":"Despite the fun nature of this line and the fact that its somewhat large when compared to the surrounding talus blocks, its easy to miss this one. You can even spot it from the main trail, roughly 15 yards off to the side. \n\n  From the point of the trail where you break to Teddy Bear, turn left instead and look towards the never ending line of talus blocks. Walk towards the talus and look for the biggest block. The total length wont be immediately recognizable because this one starts down in a shallow pit."},"__v":0},{"_id":"59qIjzykXheUP6exv2AiSw==","name":"Panda Crack","yds":"V0","grades":{"yds":"V0","font":"4","vscale":"V0"},"fa":"Eugenel Espiritu","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21634,40.48938]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"119293783","mp_crag_id":"111503576","climb_id":"59qIjzykXheUP6exv2AiSw==","areaRef":"mK3jNf0sW0mRmp5Vc7f1TA=="},"content":{"description":"Offwidth crack, a tad bigger than most male fists.","protection":"Crash pad","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,c557f60c-fdc4-50a5-a046-ee2be8ec0b64,d9750f05-6ef3-5d1d-97a6-4b7ca6a1db90,21ceb352-ff82-51eb-bce8-4e2c739c4815,98ade335-fd2c-5b49-919a-9e5573b7f54c","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","Southeastern Lowlands","Haycock Mountain (Nockamixon)","Teddy Bear Area","Teddy Bear Satellite"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"},{"count":1,"label":"V0"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21634,40.48938]},"bbox":[-75.21693124867073,40.48893033981814,-75.21574875132926,40.48982966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111503576","area_id":"mK3jNf0sW0mRmp5Vc7f1TA==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-75.21693124867073,40.48893033981814],[-75.21574875132926,40.48893033981814],[-75.21574875132926,40.48982966018186],[-75.21693124867073,40.48982966018186],[-75.21693124867073,40.48893033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"There is quite a bit of talus around the Teddy Bear area.
