Start in the crack at the back of the cave. Traverse leftward across the left overhanging face. Work your way through a heinous gaston and then out to the lip. Round the lip and make your way up the slab.","protection":"2-3 pads.  \n\n  Because you traverse the left overhanging face for a bit, you'll need 1-2 pads for this stretch and maybe another near the start of near the end for good measure. Its a bit cramped in the little corridor, but the landing directly underneath the crux traverse section is flat and can be easily padded.","location":"As with Witch Hazel, The Wookie is in the little corridor behind Hematoma. Find the Hematoma boulder from the main trail (its smack on it!) and walk around the leftside of the boulder to access the back. Walk into the narrow little corridor.

Work you way up the rail and the right arete until its possible to turn onto the face. Brace yourself for a somewhat tricky and elusive topout.  \n\n  Careful not to dab, this one gets a bit tight.","protection":"2 pads. This one has a pretty steep ramp that you'll land on if you come off. Because of the steepness, you'll likely slide down just like a sliding board. With only one pad, its hard to get it to lay without sliding down. With two pads, you can pretty much cover the whole ramp.  \n\n  There is a slight, but very real chance of falling off the short face and missing the ramp. If this happens, you're in for quite an uncontrollable fall into a pit. An attentive spotter is a plus for this one.","location":"If you can find Hematoma, you can find this on. While standing on the main trail and looking at Hematoma, work your way around the left side of the boulder and go to the backside.
