Although this is pretty lowball, the reason you need a few pads is because this traverses left to right for a good bit until you start heading up. This is situated just above  a pit, but over the years logs have been added to try to build up a landing. The logs are stable (somewhat) but be sure to weight test them a few times to be sure they didn't move. You wouldn't want to biff into the pit.","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"oxA3RoBSXL+x8nT2MBxrVg==","name":"Cooperazzi","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.21844,40.48832]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"109610176","mp_crag_id":"113958891","climb_id":"oxA3RoBSXL+x8nT2MBxrVg==","areaRef":"haugJchkWDGJ00G52tHutg=="},"content":{"description":"Start on the v-shaped slopers in the center of the boulder.
