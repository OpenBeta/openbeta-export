Several small outcroppings. Rock quality is good but the rock worth climbing is in short supply. Adjacent to private land on two sides and the Brandywine Creek on another, these rocks lie on within the borders of Marsh Creek State Park where the lake drains and joins the Brandywine creek. Accessing some of the boulders involves either a creek crossing or walking over a very old and in questionable condition railroad bridge...your call."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:00.914Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:28.373Z"}
