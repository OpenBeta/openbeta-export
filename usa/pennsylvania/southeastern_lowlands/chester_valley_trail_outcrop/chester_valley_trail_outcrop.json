Not much but enough to keep a beginner occupied for a couple hours. It is shaded pretty much all day. This is a multi-use trail so there are many runners and bikers when the weather is good, but the trail is wide enough that this isn't really an issue. Rock varies from flaky shale to very good and solid with the shale making up the bottom 1-2 of most spots. There are probably more spots like this along the trail and in the wooded area surrounding it, but the trail is >13 miles long so I haven't explored it extensively."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:20:03.548Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:31.410Z"}
