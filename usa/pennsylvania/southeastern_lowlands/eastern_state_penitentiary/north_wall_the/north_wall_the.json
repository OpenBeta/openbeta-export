The coping is almost   completely missing from the a section at the top   of this area.   The Wissahickon Schist selected for this part of   the wall is especially jagged for the first half of the   climb. A large, lightly colored rectangular stone is   set back about 2” deeper than its neighbors near   the halfway mark. Following this ledge is a challenging series of distant crimps, zig-zagging a path   up to a sparse, dynamic finish.","protection":"Improvised Materials","location":"Come out of the north entrance of Cellblock 4 facing the wall.
