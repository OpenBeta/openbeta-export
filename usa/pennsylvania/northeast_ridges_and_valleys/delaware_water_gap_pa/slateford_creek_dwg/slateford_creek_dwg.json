Climbing next to a 65 foot roaring waterfall is awesome! Climbs are located on the South and North of Slateford Creek at the base of the Slateford Waterfall. These climbs are on shale cliffs and are wet most of the summer. Spring and Fall are good times to climb these or in the winter for mixed climbing. All of the routes are recommended to be top-roped due to issues on the tops of the cliffs."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:56.685Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:05:52.712Z"}
