There is a bolted belay next to a medium size tree directly above, halfway up the wall. It is 5.5, but you may have to hunt for the 5.5 moves, a direct line will be a bit harder. Gear in the beginning seemed sparse, better up high.  \n\n  For P2, the crux is right off the belay ledge. Start just left of the belay/tree and move up in an alcove, Get good gear and pull the overhang, then sprint up 70' of easy terrain to a small tree and second set of bolts.","protection":"Rock pro, trees, bolted rap/belay stations","location":"Starts on the left side of the Cat Wall. \n\n  Descent - Rappel the route in two raps with a single 60m rope."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,e66a7f5e-9c62-5282-8578-b6d5e239d014,9ad2ba77-9e1d-530a-beb8-966a3a79da3a,aa793def-b44d-5520-90b8-6612268efea0,9aa278f0-a71b-5e22-bef5-97b448f743a2,a34861e3-9123-5091-9169-871028a4b3ca","pathTokens":["USA","Pennsylvania","Northeast Ridges and Valleys","Delaware Water Gap (PA)","Mount Minsi","d.
