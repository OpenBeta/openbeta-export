This wall has the potential for one or two nice routes.  This wall will require lots of work and cleaning.  The Poison Ivy needs to go first!  It is nasty stuff.  My daughter and I spent weeks on steroids after cleaning the PI from the Skooch Wall.  The PI in the Enigma Crack had vines as thick as my arm!  If you attempt to clean this face, wear rubber gloves and a Tyvek suit!  I would also recommend cold weather only."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:19:57.468Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:23.330Z"}
