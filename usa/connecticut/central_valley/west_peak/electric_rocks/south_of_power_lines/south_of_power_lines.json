There is a fair amount of moss/grime at the start too. Once you get to the flake, there are plenty of options for pro as you work up and around it. Once past the flake (where the tree is in the picture), it's smooth sailing to the top.","protection":"Up to #3 Cams and a set of nuts","location":"Once parked at the Sloper parking lot, follow the power lines toward the cliffs. The trail will eventually turn into a black blazed trail, at which point you can follow this all the way to the top, cross past to the south of the power lines, and find a few gullies to climb down to get to the base of Low Voltage Crag. The other option is to bear right off the black blazed trail once you get to the scree field and do a semi-bushwhack to the base of the cliff. This route in particular is furthest to the climber's right (route 19 in the Connecticut Climbing book)."},"__v":0},{"_id":"yDqceBjTX7eKwsa01OL1tQ==","name":"Nightcrawler","yds":"5.5","grades":{"yds":"5.5","french":"4b"},"fa":"Ken Nichols, Chris Stone, 1975","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.82993,41.58799]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"117086757","mp_crag_id":"108190304","climb_id":"yDqceBjTX7eKwsa01OL1tQ==","areaRef":"RTOT5IlvUHiyOgK53a7H6Q=="},"content":{"description":"There are a few trees growing out of the cracks on this route, making for a few interesting moves to work around them.
