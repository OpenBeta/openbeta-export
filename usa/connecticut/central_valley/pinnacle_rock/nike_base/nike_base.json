It has a lovely view of the suburbs and is delightfully free of the broken beer bottles that adorn Pinnacle.  Most climbs are 40-50 ft. tall. The ratings are old-school and stiff. \n\n  The crag is named for a Cold War era surface-to-air missile radar site that was located here and operational from 1956-61.  You can still see remnants of the concrete and fences, especially if you walk a bit south on the Metacomet Trail.

Bring a long static or webbing to set top rope anchors from trees."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:03.098Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T00:59:57.411Z"}
