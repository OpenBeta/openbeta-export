Although the finger crack is short, it is a true CT adventure. Best to do in two short pitches to avoid rope drag.

A Connecticut classic.  Although obvious from the road below, this is somewhat tricky to find when approaching from the blue trail from the parking lot at the castle.  Be sure to look at the landmarks around the climb as you drive up. \n\n  Climb the relatively easy corner to the first roof, undercling left (crux), and continue up a wide crack through another smaller roof to the top.  A belay can be set after the first undercling to lessen rope drag. \n\n  Approach from the Metacomet trail.  A gully on the south side gives access from the trail. \n\n  This can be toproped but a fall from under the crux overhang generates a very wild swing into space.

Solid dark basalt rock, pretty secluded.  \n\n  By John Peterson: \n\n  This area contains a number of different rock faces. As you look across the water from the approach road, Ampitheater is the biggest face, on the left, Fall Wall is a smaller face to the right, and Merimere Face is the rightmost of the larger cliffs, easily identified by the roofs of Thor's Hammer. \n\n  There are many smaller routes on the crags near the castle but these are mostly garbage (literally). Of all the routes in the green book in the castle area, the only one I'd reccomend is Glassworks.
