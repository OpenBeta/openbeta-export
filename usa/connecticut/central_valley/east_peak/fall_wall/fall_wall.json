Carefully peer into the crack, seeing if the monster rat snake has returned home that day.\n\n Rest and then pull above the roof at a left-facing corner, questing into the action packed cruxes above.

Good protection is available here, but the gear is very specific, somewhat finicky, and it's strenuous to place.\n\n Continue above, following an interesting variety of holds near a jagged crack, and enjoy sustained pumpy climbing.
