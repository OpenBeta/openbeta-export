Before it was freed, The Cage was an A3 aid climb. As such, it had only 3 ascents before that status changed, including Sam's first. I did the last aid ascent. Back in those days some of us were interested in training for Yosemite's \"Big walls\", so we practiced aid climbing where we could. It was during the 2nd aid ascent that apparently the leader found the nailing too committing, and so drilled a bolt before doing the last few \"Rurp\" placements. After completing this 2nd ascent, he then thought better of it, and rappelled down and chopped the offending bolt. Sometime later, this same climber decided the route could go free, but wanted a bolt, right where he had chopped the first one. To his credit, he drilled that 2nd bolt free and on the lead. It just goes to show, sometimes all this bolt stuff is not as cut and dried as some fundamentalists would have you believe. For the record, my aid ascent took place while the 1st bolt was still there, and I did clip it and was grateful it was there. I guess Sam did the only aid ascent.\" -Courtesy of Mike Heintz\n\n ","protection":"PM or post info pls...","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"uHiDbbKRW6OnQNCxh100nA==","name":"Bushy Groove","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"John Reppy, 1955","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.82342,41.6175]},"left_right_index":47,"mp_id":"105805307","mp_crag_id":"105799122","climb_id":"uHiDbbKRW6OnQNCxh100nA==","areaRef":"aafZQHPWWwiNIlDJgYnYqg=="},"content":{"description":"This route is seldom climbed but definitely worth doing.

Bring your long climbing rope and anchor rope.  \n\n  Many of the Connecticut's finest routes are at Ragged Mountain, including Wiessner Slab, Wiessner Crack, Unconquerable Crack, Broadway, the YMC Route, Carey Corner, and Subline. Climbers of all abilities will find high-quality routes at Ragged.  \n\n  Ragged has a long climbing history - many famous climbers have put up routes there, including Fritz Wiessner, Henry Barber, and Layton Kor. \n\n  Descend from all climbs using the trails at either end of the crag. \n\n  Ragged Mountain is owned by a group of climbers, the Ragged Mountain Foundation.  For directions to the crag and parking, please see their website at raggedmtn.org.  Please respect the neighbors and avoid trespassing or parking in the many no-parking zones. \n\n  Although the RMF does not charge admission to their property, they rely on donations and memberships to survive.  They have constructed trails, fought for parking, and advocated for climbers all through Connecticut.  If you climb there you should become a member - an annual membership is cheaper than a single day in the Gunks. A Historic Guide to Ragged Mountain (1964) John Reppy and Sam Streibert have generously allowed a copy of the original Ragged Mountain guidebook to be hosted on the Internet.  I've attached this as a comment below.  This is an interesting historical document and also a very good guide to many of the classic climbs at Ragged.A Guide to Ragged (1964) Please note that the 1964 guide lists routes on the Small Cliff. This cliff is on private land and not currently open to climbers. Restrictions This property is governed by a very strict conservation agreement.  Adding new fixed protection is forbidden.  Protection that existed when the cliff was transferred to the RMF can be replaced or upgraded but this is best done by locals.  \n\n  Commercial use of Ragged Mountain is strictly regulated.  Groups of more that 6 cannot use this area if participants are paying.  If you have any questions about whether your group is commercial, please contact the RMF.  Any large groups should contact the RMF before they use the crag. \n\n  There is absolutely no camping allowed on Ragged Mountain or anywhere nearby. \n\n   Please check the RMF website and the kiosk below the cliff for additional regulations."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":89,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:01.424Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:35.884Z"}
