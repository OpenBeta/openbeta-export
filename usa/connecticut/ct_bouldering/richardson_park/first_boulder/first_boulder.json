Start standing on the ledge and tap it with your hands. get your feet as high as possible using weight shifts, dishes, friction, and possibly some crimps. once you get your feet high enough you can either reach up to the jug or more likely, jump to the jug. from there, you can work statically to the top or jump to the second jug and celebrate. It isn't that bad once you get it, but it is very hard to figure out. It is a lot harder if you are shorter. ledge and rail to the right are off and the crimp to the left that's a part of \"Rock-A-Bout\" is also off.","protection":"A pad, and probably a spotter.","location":"Right in front of the big tree, start standing on the ledge, and touch itÂ with your hands to start."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a2f1ea01-91f2-59f1-b724-e30fafb7d4e8,799b7548-4b56-53ab-aa29-6b22914ec00e,cb881eda-092c-59d7-903b-a2a6f914e764,09c3260d-89fe-533c-8b21-d14070ae14f3","pathTokens":["USA","Connecticut","CT Bouldering","Richardson Park","First Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V0"},{"count":1,"label":"V3-4"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.53032,41.32336]},"bbox":[-73.53091875257802,41.32291033981813,-73.52972124742199,41.32380966018185],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118956781","area_id":"CcMmDYn+UzyLIdFAcK4U8w==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-73.53091875257802,41.32291033981813],[-73.52972124742199,41.32291033981813],[-73.52972124742199,41.32380966018185],[-73.53091875257802,41.32380966018185],[-73.53091875257802,41.32291033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the first visible boulder as you walk in. it has a few decent routes and features"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:05.507Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:33.332Z"}
