Large gimme foot holds kinda ruin this as a boulder problem, but its still worth doing. Heck- do laps on it.   Campus it.   There's some real nice moves across the diagonal crack.  The sit start is awkward and kinda sill, a standing start on jugs is nicer.","protection":"Dont really need anything. Bugspray.","location":"Start on the lower left side of the large face sitting, work up onto block and into handcrack.  Several crosses and you drop into a flake, and drop into a hard match on a perfect small horizontal.  Balancy moves get you out to the right side where it gets easier and you top out on the arete and some cool pinches."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a2f1ea01-91f2-59f1-b724-e30fafb7d4e8,799b7548-4b56-53ab-aa29-6b22914ec00e,75b54355-0b11-50e3-bd7d-7a783b05377a,709c3643-8230-525b-9bc9-12c3493cecaa,100ecf3d-6465-526a-9b64-4473815bf1e4","pathTokens":["USA","Connecticut","CT Bouldering","Nehantic State Forest","Keeny Road Boulders","Piano Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.3182,41.3771]},"bbox":[-72.31879924702747,41.37665033981814,-72.31760075297252,41.37754966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107634892","area_id":"EA7PPWRlUmqbZERzgVvx5A=="},"content":{"description":"Large flat boulder five minutes up the trail to the left after balance rock.
