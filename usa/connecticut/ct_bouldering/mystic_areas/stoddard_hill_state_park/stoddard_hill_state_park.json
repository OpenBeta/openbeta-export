It is about 5 minutes from Mohegan Sun Casino. Park at the boat ramp and follow the trail across from the boat ramp, up stream, to the Stoddard graveyard. Just above the graveyard are the diamond hard cliff bands that make up the area. This area has some fantastically steep gneiss rock with super unique holds. Its also idyllically located on the Thames River which often cools the area down and offers a great western view. This area gets good afternoon sun. This is a small bouldering area with PERFECT rock.  The rock is gneiss, but feels almost like quartzite.\n\n VIDEO: s22.photobucket.com/albums/…¤t=stoddard1.flv "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:08.035Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:07.567Z"}
