It is right off of Exit 89 of I-95. This boulder has a plethora of nasty little grips in the form of small crimps and slopers. It is also quite steep. This is a good combination for fun hard climbing. It is three minutes from downtown. It home to the classics such as Cannibal Ox, The Natural Mystic, and the crimpy One Truth. Its also right next to I-95 so expect so road noise, but there is also a nice little swamp there too and on a late night with the lanterns it can be a nice spot.\n\ns22.photobucket.com/albums/â€¦\n\n "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:08.035Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:58.705Z"}
