The land is part of Copp Family Park in Groton. In particular there is a big roof and some very cool looking slabs. A few problems have been done here. If you look on the map it might be worth hiking the contours to the south east. There also appears to be a few huge erratics with perfect stone."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:08.977Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:38.603Z"}
