Staying on the left side of the arete is easier (V0), and there's a great variation traversing further right that has a long move on slopey pockets (V3).Note: This excellent boulder is slightly overhung and has a great, flat landing with a handful of fun problems and variations from V0-V4. It's absolutely been climbed in the past, but I spent some time in Jan 2021 giving it a thorough clean-up (aside from the wet/mossy crack in the middle). Between this and the handful of other problems in this zone, it's worth the jaunt for some easy-moderate bouldering. This area tends to have a nice, warm micro-climate in the cold months.","protection":"","location":"Located below Grey Matter directly off of the orange/blue-blazed trail.
