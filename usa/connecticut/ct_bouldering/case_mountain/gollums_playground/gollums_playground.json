There are 2 veins of quartz running vertically up this wall that make it look cool and give it its own character as well as some horizontal cracks.     There are also 2 nearby walls; Chipmunk Wall and Lego Wall, SW of the actual Playground proper, which are good for beginner warm-ups or just for funsies.\n\n     Harder routes along with several others still need to be established by someone better/stronger than myself and the routes listed here are in no way comprehensive or the complete picture of the potential here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":12,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.024Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:43.198Z"}
