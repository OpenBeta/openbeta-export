The traverses can be modified to be more difficult.   There are several easy/forgiving slopers and some more challenging crimps along these traverses. The top-out routes are more limited in number and are generally easy, although there are a few small finger pockets that can be used to add difficulty.    The ground is soft & flat, perfect for several mats, and a big fallen tree offers a nice spot to sit and rest. Mountain bikers frequently ride by at a safe distance (since the wall is not directly on a trail).Great spot!"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:09.934Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:01.628Z"}
