This time work left towards the arete with a high left foot on the outer most point. It's a difficult side-pull with your left hand on the arete with a high left foot to rock onto which gives it a V2 rating, otherwise a nice V1 finish along the arete. Top out is easier than adjacent climbs. Exit the boulder down the less than vertical opposite side and use the tree to stabilize/jump off. This is the dotted red route in the pictures.

This is a nice warm-up V1 that starts just 10-12 inches off the ground with both feet on the boulder. There is a left handed side-pull about half way up which is probably the most precarious position as you have to then reach with the right hand to a fairly crimpy hold, but its solid if placed correctly. Top out is a little bit of a tough mantle for a beginner and given the height could be dangerous for a first-timer. Recommend 2-3 pads for a beginner group but we did fine with just one pad and one spotter. The route is the yellow dotted line in the picture.
