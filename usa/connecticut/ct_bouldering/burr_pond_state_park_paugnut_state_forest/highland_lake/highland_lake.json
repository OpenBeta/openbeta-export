There are a handful of very good pink granitic gneiss boulders among the slabs.Almost completely undeveloped, so bring your brushes.  As far as I’m aware, there is no documented climbing history on any of these, despite how crowded Highland Lake can get in the summer. Legal access. Close enough to the lake that boat traffic is audible."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:11.022Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:03.333Z"}
