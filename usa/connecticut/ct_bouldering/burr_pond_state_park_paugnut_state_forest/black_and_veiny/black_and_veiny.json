Clean and sound with little to no moss, no loose or crumbly areas, and grittty sticky granite.  Landings are relatively flat and clear of obstructions.  Uphill face provides easy route back off.     Left face (looking uphill) is slightly less than vertical and has two lines of deep hand cracks.  Downhill face has slight overhang and gritty slopers.  Right face has shallow finger cracks and more challenging routes up.   Be wary of black bears throughout the park, and since this trail is used by mountain bikers who may not see you as they come around switchbacks - try to not block the trail."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:11.027Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:03.726Z"}
