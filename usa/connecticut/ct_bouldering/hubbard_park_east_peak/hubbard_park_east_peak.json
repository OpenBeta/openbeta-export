These are some decent boulders visible from I-691 on the  north side of the highway just before the pedestrian bridge of hubbard park.  Take a left off of exit 4 on the 691 westbound.  then take a left on W Main St and head downhill about 1/2 mile and the park entrance will be on the left.  Park at the trailhead at the back of the pond area. \n\n  There are about 12 good boulders in this area, some smallish and some highball.  The rock is traprock and the holds are big diamond shaped traprock on the ends of the boulders, and a more smeary, textured surface on the faces/backs of the boulders.  Someone else has climbed here as I found chalk on some of the more obvious lines.  There are some genuinely fun problems here,   be sure to check it out.   \n\n  I will try to get out and take some photos of some of the more obvious lines.   If anyone has climbed here or knows who did the FA's or has beta for this area please add it here.  Also, if this was someones secret spot, I'm sorry, I figured it was fair game since its in plain view from the highway."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:08.980Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:59.706Z"}
