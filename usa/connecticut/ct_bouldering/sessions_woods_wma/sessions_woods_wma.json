Whereas the most well-known walking loop traverses mostly flat terrain, there's a lesser known outer loop composed of some of the town's lighter-traveled hiking paths, part of the blue-blazed Tunxis Trail system. These paths are much steeper, narrower, and wind around near cliff bands and boulder fields on the outskirts of the park - also hosting some of the relatively least junky (though still chossy) rock in the area.\n\n To my knowledge, climbing here is no different than in other state parks: probably legal, but that also hasn't been verified with park leadership. I can't say I know much about geology, but the rock here is seemingly distinct from the flaky schist-mica bedrock boulders that are more easily found in the surrounding area, and they make for a little bit better climbing. Most of the best spots lie along the same ridgeline as the Mile of Ledges area a couple miles down the road, though Sessions definitely hosts a wider variety of boulders."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:05.500Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:54.999Z"}
