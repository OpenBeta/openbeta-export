If you have ever hiked in Roosevelt, it is hard to miss because it is not very far into the main Blue Trail. This boulder stands high amongst the scattering of small, uninteresting boulders around it. Not too far south of it is a small quarry that has some chossy yet high scrambles. \n\n  There are only a few climbs here, but its proximity to the parking lot and main Blue Trail makes it worth visiting."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:05.505Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:33.291Z"}
