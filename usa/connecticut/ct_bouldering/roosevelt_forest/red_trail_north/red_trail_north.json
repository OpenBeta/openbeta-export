It has surely been climbed before, but it is a matter of what, when, and by whom. Any historical information would be appreciated so that proper credit may be given. This area is defined by plenty of cracks. The cracks range from finger-width to small off-width. The cliff is naturally divided into two sections, left and right, by an uninteresting boulder between them. Surprisingly, the much shorter left section has most of the harder problems. However, the right section makes up for lack of difficultly with highball danger."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:05.505Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:43.104Z"}
