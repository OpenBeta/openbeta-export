It has been nearly ten years since I have been back here, so it's hard for me to remember much about it. However, I do remember there were some decent outcrops, with a number of overhanging walls, on good quality rock. Maybe around a dozen problems? Maybe more? If the bouldering turns out to not be worthwhile, you can at least finish the hike up to the top of Swan Hill for some great views of the Connecticut River.  \n\n  Hopefully, you'll be rewarded with something worthwhile. Definitely let me know what you find. Enjoy! "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:03.101Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:38.274Z"}
