It's location is pretty far out, so I wouldn't recommend making the drive for this one specific area. However, if you are in the area anyways, it's a cool spot to hit up. Also, it's about a 10-15 minute drive from the Trout Brook Nature Reserve, which is great for hiking. So, if you go hiking there, and want a little climbing afterwards, this is a great spot to do so.\n\n Also, something worth noting is that I found some old barbed wire scattered throughout the area. It's sparse, but could be easy to miss. I would not consider it dangerous, since it's old and dull by this point, but it's still worth noting.Â "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.025Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:05.322Z"}
