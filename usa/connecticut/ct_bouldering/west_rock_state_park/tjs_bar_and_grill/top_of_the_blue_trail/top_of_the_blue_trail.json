It looked like it could be a cool little crack climb and it was. Sit start with hands matched in the lowest point along the crack. First moves are the crux. Work your way up the crack to good holds and top out one of a few ways. Topping out directly above the crack might be the most fun and keeps the crack climbing style of movement going a little longer.Â ","protection":"Pads","location":"This crack is located in the center of the last short cliff band before you come to the scenic lookout point overlooking the lake when you first summit the ridge.
