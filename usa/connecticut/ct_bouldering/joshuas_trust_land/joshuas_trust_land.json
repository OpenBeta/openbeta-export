There is a main rock face with some shorter sections and outcrops (10-20 ft.) at the Coney Rock Overlook, and a few erratics to the north east on the Mullane Trail called Proposal Rocks.  I believe all the rock here is gneiss, and is similar to the rest of the rock you'll find in the mansfield area (e.g. Wolf Rock and Pot Hole) The trail is sparsely traveled, I normally only see people on the weekends hiking to enjoy the sight off of the Coney Rock overlook.  Also, the area also known as \"Mulberry Boulders\" off of Mulberry Rd. is made of the scattered boulders between the main overlook and Mulberry Rd. below.  This area has more/better problems with photos soon to come."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:08.979Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:59.662Z"}
