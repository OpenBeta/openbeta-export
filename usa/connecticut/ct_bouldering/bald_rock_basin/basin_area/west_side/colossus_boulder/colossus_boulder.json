Strenuous and technical moves on incredibly small crimpers leads to a jug 20 ft. off the deck. From the jug toss for the lip, mantle, and kiss the earth - you're alive!

Fire up to the jug atop the flake on the arete, then work your up the arete using slopers and pinches to a decent flake just right of the arete up high.
