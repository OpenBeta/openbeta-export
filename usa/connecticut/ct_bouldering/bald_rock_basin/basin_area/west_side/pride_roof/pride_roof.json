Topout is probably 30-35ft off the deck.  \n\nAt the top of the arete is a massive loose block which appears to be wedged into place although SKETCHY AS HELL. I have rappelled in and bounced on it but couldn't get it to fall. If this thing falls on you or your spotter you will likely die. The detached hanging block can be seen in the photo on the right side of the roof.
