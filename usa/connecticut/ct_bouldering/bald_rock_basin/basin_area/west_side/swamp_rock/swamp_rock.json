Several years ago a group of trees fell on the boulder and I spent several days cutting and clearing the area so it would be climbable. Now most faces are dry and I'm starting to get them cleaned up for climbing. The north face still remains undeveloped but looks to host a bunch of short thin climbing on a vertical wall with tricky slopey top outs. The western side has some hard looking slightly overhanging climbs as well as a cool looking overhaning 45 wall. The South and East sides don't really look to have any climbing.  \n\n  I wouldn't try to climb at this one if the bugs are out or if its really wet or has rained a lot recently."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:13.930Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:54.771Z"}
