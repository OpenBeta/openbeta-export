With an overhanging arete and sheer wall with HUGE feldspar mega-crystals sitting waiting for your pleasure this stone is a great HB test piece. \n\n  On April 24th, 2013  Al Ordway of Bridgeton, ME passed after a battle with cancer. Al Ordway was owner and director of Camp Winona, a small boys camp with over 100 years of tradition of turning boys into men in the great wilderness of Maine. I would not be who I am today if I had not attended Camp Winona and spent my summers under the wings of such a great man. RIP Uncle Al...
