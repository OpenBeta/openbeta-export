Though this block is short, it is worth a slap if you are in the area since it is such a close approach. Not really sure what rock type it is (conglomerate? gneiss?) but it white with black and gray streaks/waves and climbs different than other rock in the area. There are a couple lines on the face pointing away from the road and some various other traverses. The back face gets afternoon sun.Be mindful of neighbors in the area! This boulder is close to the road and within earshot of a couple houses, please keep your volume down if you go here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:08.978Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:59.988Z"}
