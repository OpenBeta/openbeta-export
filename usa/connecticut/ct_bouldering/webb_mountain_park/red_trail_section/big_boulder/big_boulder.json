Or the 4th move if you're counting matching and foot movements. Mantling up with your left arm and compressing up, while keeping pressure and not slipping on the right foot hold is the toughest park. Watch out, if that right foot slips during this movement the inside of your right knee is going right into the rock (not fun take it from me). The rest of the climb is straight forward, but if rain has washed away chalk marks, then searching for the right hold might take a second or two.Â ","protection":"Crash Pad or Spot","location":" "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a2f1ea01-91f2-59f1-b724-e30fafb7d4e8,799b7548-4b56-53ab-aa29-6b22914ec00e,323a609f-102f-5985-91fb-1a01689ba713,fc186537-a8c9-5b02-8eda-2cdceb6fb4df,ac28d3a0-b9ce-50c4-8f27-eabac1e04100","pathTokens":["USA","Connecticut","CT Bouldering","Webb Mountain Park","Red Trail Section","Big Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.16149,41.37711]},"bbox":[-73.16208924711961,41.37666033981814,-73.1608907528804,41.37755966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116848659","area_id":"rCjToLnOUMSPJ+q6weBBAA=="},"content":{"description":"About five minutes into the Red Trail at Webb Mountain Park there is a big beaut of a boulder called cleverly called \"Big Boulder\". So far there is one established V3 route on this boulder, however there possibly several higher grade climbs to be worked out. The area is canopied, cleared, and all landings are very safe, but a crash pad or spotter is recommended. The rock is fairly rough in texture, and feels crystalized on some sections. Maybe Limestone (I'm certainly not a geologist)."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:04.631Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:42:53.878Z"}
