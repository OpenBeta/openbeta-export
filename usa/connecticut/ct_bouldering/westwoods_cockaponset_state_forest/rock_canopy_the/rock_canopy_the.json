Traverse right on undercling crimps leading up to a big right handed deadpoint to a decent sloper/pinch. This is the first of three consecutive crux moves. Fall left handed into a sharp underling crimp (crux!?). Make a big move up right to a vertial pinch that is directly over your head. Match the vertical pinch and move right out to a good sloper on the lip. Match it and top out. \n\n  Every move is hard and this route requires a large amount of tension the entire time.
