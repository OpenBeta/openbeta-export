After some tips from Wivanoff and some handy LiDAR maps, I've been able to locate at least one sector of boulders in the Forest. Located just above the pond below the steep slope, the north eastern section of the Fire Rd holds a nice sector of quality boulders. The rock composition is granitic gniess and very much resembles that of Bald Rock Basin's boulders. It appears as though there's been some cleaning of problems here... and quiet a few look very very difficult. \n\nTrail Map PDF"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:05.506Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:02.743Z"}
