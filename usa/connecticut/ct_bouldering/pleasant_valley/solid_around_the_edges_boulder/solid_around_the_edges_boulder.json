This formation sits on (or real close to) the geologic formation Cameron's line which runs vertically through the eastern portion of the Pleasant Valley area, this may explain why the boulders off of the park road entrance feel and look so distinct from one another. Unfortunately for this boulder, all the face holds are poor quality, though the two sloping edges going up to the high point in the center of the boulder are decently solid and worth a slap if you are in the area."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:06.868Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:35.824Z"}
