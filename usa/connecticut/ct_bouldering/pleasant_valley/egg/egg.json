Start crossed on the lowest two slopers, throw a right heel and pull out of the dirt. The route slaps out a couple feet then up Â a couple more feet. Decent quality rock, its a shame its so short. Route may be easier if you are missing your left leg as the hardest part is not dabbin.","protection":"A briefcase pad and a carpet square will do ya just fine, a sweatshirt half full of leaves would suffice","location":"North of Walt Landgraf trail"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a2f1ea01-91f2-59f1-b724-e30fafb7d4e8,799b7548-4b56-53ab-aa29-6b22914ec00e,d224d048-1e91-56db-9e78-e619e37f117c,c329ea40-5678-5eea-9ee3-9d218a8173d0","pathTokens":["USA","Connecticut","CT Bouldering","Pleasant Valley","EGG"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V2-3"}],"byDiscipline":{"boulder":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.977,41.92561]},"bbox":[-72.97760437143315,41.925160339818135,-72.97639562856688,41.926059660181856],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120381097","area_id":"wynqQFZ4Xuqe450hioFz0A=="},"content":{"description":"mid day - afternoon sun, pretty scenic, fun little slopey lowball with one ok problem on it."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:06.873Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:45.000Z"}
