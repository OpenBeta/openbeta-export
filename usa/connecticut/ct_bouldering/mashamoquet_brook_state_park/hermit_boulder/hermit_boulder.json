The rock quality is actually pretty decent, despite the name. Every time I would link some moves, my buddy who is maybe 15 lbs heavier would try them and break off a little piece of a hold. Right after I did the FA, he broke a crimp towards the end. The problem still goes, but might be a grade or two harder. Psyched to try and FA it again!\n\n Edit: I went back with a hammer and chisel and gave this problem a proper clean. It still goes, even more fun to climb now, and might actually be easier too, say V6ish.Â ","protection":"","location":"Start sitting on the right side of the big overhang on a good crimp.
