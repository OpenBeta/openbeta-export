The property owners delineation marker is about 10' from this wall, so even though it is in the parks area, could cause access issues potentially. Lots of glass broken everywhere. Pretty much someones backyard. \n\n  The rock here is extremely wet fromt he dense forest allowing very little light in. I am assuming this would be a decent summer project when things dry up. Until then, it isn't even worth checking out really. \n\n  Definitely needs a good cleaning and scraping. Some very loose stone here.
