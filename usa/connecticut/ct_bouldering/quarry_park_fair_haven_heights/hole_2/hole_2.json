Parts are somewhat slabby and the overhang at the top looks really loose and mixed with soil. This could pose topping out issues, but maybe after a lot of cleaning work, it could provide some decent routes. The wall itself is pretty large, almost 80' from the bottom of the hole I would say. \n\n  As with the rest of the rock in this park, very wet since the woods are super dense. I think this entire area would be a decent summer spot for locals, not so much worth traveling for."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:05.507Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:02.201Z"}
