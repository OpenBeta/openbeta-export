These are hidden throughout the trail system, some more easily found than others. For instance, \"Sideshow\" and \"Flaky Cave\" are directly on the main rail trail. Others, such as a local favorites \"Old Jim\"(found near the spray painted indian) and \"Fatal Glacial\" are deep in the lush deciduous forest. A great number of these bouldering problems are covered in moss and lichen in the damper months."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.915Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:15.319Z"}
