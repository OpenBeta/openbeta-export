Directly above the first large diagonal crack (6ft off ground) is a small undercling flake with some crimpers on a flake just above it. Be gentle on these crimpers and work your feet up to gain some small holds. Climb up the technical section to just below the large spear-shaped block lodged in the second large diagonal crack. The block is LOOSE ~ DO NOT USE! From the block move straight up through some more great moves on incredible stone past the large pine tree.
