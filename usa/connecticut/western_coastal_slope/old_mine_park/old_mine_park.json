At the base of the cliff there is a scooped out area that is about 1ft of water hence is a mosquito breeding pool. There are also lots of big bull frogs that provide cool company. \n\n  Rock is quartz intermixed with granite as it's very solid all around, no chossiness. The whole face is ever-so-slightly positive. \n\n  The left side of the face is like a big 5.6. The quartz makes it kind of \"slick\" to climb on so watch out with smears if you're a total newbie to climbing. \n\n  Holds on the right of the face are mostly little crimpy ridges, the occasional sloper or sometimes a jug. \n\n  Partly sunny. Bring bug spray. Lots and lots of poison ivy clustered as you walk into the cliff area, so be aware of that if you're allergic! \n\n  The top of the cliff is angled very sharply so be mindful while setting up a TR anchor. This also causes lots of dirt to wash down and then cake onto the positivity of the cliff, which means it needs to be cleaned seasonally."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.916Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:53.236Z"}
