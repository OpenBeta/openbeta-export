Half scramble, half climb. Some technical footwork but mostly easy (very slabby) terrain. Some tricky moves here and there (5.7ish), but can be avoided or gone around. Communication can be difficult with highway noise.  Plenty of flakes (mostly 1-3\") , sufficient protection. Can easily be done in approach/hiking shoes. Fun solo","protection":"Trad gear","location":"Work in progress. Follow the train tracks until you are almost under the face. Bushwhack left up to the bottom of the face. First landmark to aim for is an exposed pine tree. From here continue up and left (if possible) to the \"Mike n Mo\" spray paint graffiti. \n\n At top out, bushwhack for a few minutes along the ridge (in a direction parallel to river) until you come to a large slab clearing. From here follow white blazed trail back to road and parking area.Â "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a2f1ea01-91f2-59f1-b724-e30fafb7d4e8,90fdf2ed-428d-5c89-9f6a-b540cabd374b,459a847c-cca7-5b98-844f-c2fb61102444,b30ee181-186d-56cb-873d-09ffa100ddce","pathTokens":["USA","Connecticut","Western Coastal Slope","Naugatuck State Forest","Toby's Rock Mtn."],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.7"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.0579,41.4609]},"bbox":[-73.05850002073831,41.46045033981813,-73.0572999792617,41.46134966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108170836","area_id":"sw7hgRhtVsuHPQn/oQDdzg==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-73.05850002073831,41.46045033981813],[-73.0572999792617,41.46045033981813],[-73.0572999792617,41.46134966018187],[-73.05850002073831,41.46134966018187],[-73.05850002073831,41.46045033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"Toby's Rock Mtn.
