It's easy to see how this 300ft tall cliff is the largest in the state... AND THE MOST DANGEROUS. This area was created from extensive quarrying operations. As a result the base is covered in shrapnel from massive blocks disloging and exploding at the base. It is NOT recommended that anyone belay at the base of any of these cliffs. Even lowering down can cause problems with the rope dislodging  flakes and blocks that could injure, cut ropes, and kill."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.918Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:53.376Z"}
