It is not recommended to hike into the base of this climb due to abundant poison ivy and difficult hiking however the danger to you and your belayer from massive rock fall should not be underestimated. Personally I would never belay from the base below the gigantic bus sized block that's loose. NO JOKE. \n\n     From the base work your way up the off angle ramp. As you near the top of the slab follow holds towards the overhang. Pull through the overhang on good holds and work out left a bit and then fire the painted face to the top. Would be a great route if it wasn't for the paint. And it's thick paint too. \n\n  Not a recommended lead...","protection":"Gear, 2 Bolt Anchor","location":"Overlook Parking Lot"},"__v":0},{"_id":"bJ1ybMpsWeK8o9QXWezwAA==","name":"Passage to India","yds":"5.8","grades":{"yds":"5.8","french":"5b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.9614,41.33219]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108380115","mp_crag_id":"108463212","climb_id":"bJ1ybMpsWeK8o9QXWezwAA==","areaRef":"/RB0fNf5WnWTFl4ALAwRvw=="},"content":{"description":"Passages supposedly ascends the face to the right of the White Streak and finishes just right of the roof. \n\n  Pls post description in comments and I will update, thnx!","protection":"Trad/Gear Anchor","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a2f1ea01-91f2-59f1-b724-e30fafb7d4e8,90fdf2ed-428d-5c89-9f6a-b540cabd374b,718b6de4-3a7d-5cb6-9ca5-4f232932416b,7675fa19-be74-5b16-9b21-f7c645a435b3,fd10747c-d7f9-5a75-9316-5e002c0c11bf","pathTokens":["USA","Connecticut","Western Coastal Slope","West Rock State Park","South Buttress","Overlook Routes"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.9614,41.33219]},"bbox":[-72.96199883372863,41.33174033981813,-72.96080116627135,41.33263966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108463212","area_id":"/RB0fNf5WnWTFl4ALAwRvw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-72.96199883372863,41.33174033981813],[-72.96080116627135,41.33174033981813],[-72.96080116627135,41.33263966018186],[-72.96199883372863,41.33263966018186],[-72.96199883372863,41.33174033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":"This is the northern most area on the South Buttress. These routes are routinely top-roped from the popular tourist overlook. Offering sweeping views of the valley, climbing here gives one a real feeling of exposure, and danger too... There are some MASSIVE loose blocks here and one MUST BE VERY CAREFUL. Entire features are loose. Lead climbing these is really not recommended IMO, if there's any rockfall your belayer will get creamed at the base.  \n\n    To the climbers right of Passages is a BUS SIZED massive overhanging arete.
