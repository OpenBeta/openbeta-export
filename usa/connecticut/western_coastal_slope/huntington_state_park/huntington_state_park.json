The park was donated to the citizens of Connecticut by the internationally renowned Huntington family. \n\n  On the Southeastern flank at the bottom of the long sloping hill that is Huntington Park, is a small 50ft beginners top roping area. The climbs are short but worthwhile for locals looking to get on an easy cliff. There is also a fair amount of bouldering potential with a few different lines having been completed already."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:13.934Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:17.441Z"}
