The wall is hidden by the canopy of the forest from the sun. The rock has a tendency to be wet in areas due to run-off from above. The only real crowd one might expect to see are people walking their dogs. Interesting enough, there are several rusty pitons scattered in different parts of the wall. There are also a bunch of boulders in this area as well. There are several trad climbs, and everything is top ropeable. Several classic lines now have fixed anchors to minimize rope drag and prevent further erosion on top of the cliff. Otherwise, extended anchors to minimize rope drag may be necessary. This crag is also a great location for folks who have learned to climb in the gym and want to take their first steps to climb outside. It's has something for everyone: classic cracks, heady trad routes, mixed routes, and boulders.\n\n Crag maintenance: Due to the location of this crag, other user groups including graffiti \"artists\", homeless people and people that like to leave their trash and broken bottles everywhere, it will quickly become grungy and disgusting. Upon visiting, please pack out any trash or broken glass that you might find during your visit. If we can all take care of this great little historical piece of rock, we can ensure a fun experience for the local climbing community.\n\n Local ethics: This is one of CT's most historical crags, seeing many of its first free ascents in the 1970's and 80's. While there is still room for new free routes on the wall, any new routes requiring fixed hardware (i.e., bolts) must be done on lead. Rap-bolting is not permitted. Hardware placed next to natural pro is also not permitted. New routes not following these ethics will be chopped."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":30,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:13.934Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:43:08.821Z"}
