Upwards of 350 feet of vertical rise between the bottom of the flows and the top of the hill.Access appears legal - within Housatonic State Forest, but just south of and outside of the restricted Canaan Mountain Natural Area Preserve at the top of the mountain.  Please try to not stray too far north and into the protected area. There is a long history of ice climbing here, but I can’t personally speak for details of any individual routes. Can someone who does know fill in the details?"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.026Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:43.342Z"}
