Much like an ice park (a la Ouray), Thomaston can be a busy crag, but the ability to easily string ropes (via leading or setting up top ropes) on a wide variety of lines can help disperse the use.  The crag gets sun most of the day, leading to plastic ice conditions (but it can also get drippy). \n\n  The routes are in the WI2-WI4+ range and are about 50' tall.  Mixed climbs can also be done, but the quarried walls are pretty solid but don't feature many incut holds.  Drytooling can be desperate. \n\n  Setting up top ropes can easily be accomplished by walking around the left side of the crag to access the large, live trees atop the cliff.  Some trees have rappel anchors on them, but walking off is easy enough if the anchors have been removed."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:01.422Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:26.028Z"}
