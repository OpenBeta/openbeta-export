This is a great beginner's area since it has a variety of independent lines of moderate difficulty.  \n\n  If you're not up to leading, all of the routes can be easily top roped off trees by walking left (some WI1 approach ice) up the summer trail to the top of the cliff.  Some of the trees are close to the edge, so use appropriate caution getting to them. \n\n  Between the main falls and the canyon's pillars are a couple of fun mixed lines that are good traditional leads when conditions are fat."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.025Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:14.260Z"}
