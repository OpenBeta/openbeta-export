The deep cut into bedrock seeps groundwater, and when combined with melting from further uphill, develops ice flows that should be climbable under ideal conditions. Faces east. Legal, easy access.  Unclear if there’s any climbing history here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.025Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:13.682Z"}
