Start by stemming the corner to a comfortable, narrow ledge at 10' height.  Pull on side jug and gneiss nubbins to mantle the triangular ledge (crux) - watch out for loose rock at the back corner.  A BD #5 can protect this crux, but the wide crack may require some cleaning/gardening. Then use discontinuous finger cracks (at corner) to final mantle move before you scramble up a large ledge to the top. Amazing view at the top! \n\n  Not ideal for first lead.  One-handed placement required at crux, and you'll likely need to do some cleaning along the way. A great top rope option for new climbers.","protection":"Stoppers, hexes, and cams (up to BD #5).
