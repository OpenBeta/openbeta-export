Easily distinguished by large horizontal cracks that span almost the entire face. On the north end of the wall the slope levels out enough for scrambling up in order to reach the top of the cliff. Top ropes can be set up using a variety of trees on the top of the cliff, but this area is perhaps better suited for the numerous different traverses that can be found along the length of the wall, at different heights and difficulties."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.029Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:43.456Z"}
