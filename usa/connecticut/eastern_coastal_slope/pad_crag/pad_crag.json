I don't know of any climbing history here but would love to know of it if it exists! \n\n   The routes are between 30 and 40 feet in length and climb on high quality gneiss. All the routes are protected by natural gear but, because of the belly-shape of the cliff, you usually have to boulder the first section before you can place a piece, so...bring a pad. Also, bring 50-100 ft. of webbing for anchors as there are no fixed anchors. Bring your small stuff up to a #1 BD and a brush. This crag has potential for a few more FA's, but needs a little attention."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.026Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:43.364Z"}
