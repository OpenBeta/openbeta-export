But we didn't that day!\n\n Not a classic, but something else for others who, like us, have climbed everything at Chatfield more times than they can count.\n\n Route Description:\n\n Facing the cliff, around the right of the arete to the right of Forearm Frenzy is a short dihedral corner, overhanging to its left and kind of dirty. At the top and just to the left of the corner are a couple of ledges about 15 feet up. Start in the corner, climb up the dihedral until you can step over left and pull yourself onto the ledge about 15 feet up. Follow a very small \"ramp\" onto a first, proper ledge. (5.5)\n\n Above the set of ledges is a short vertical face about 7 feet tall. Once on the first ledge, tend left and get on top of a second ledge a few feet higher (there's a prominent horizontal crack just above this ledge). From here, traverse out left until near the edge of the arete and then go straight up the face on its left side, which means surmounting the short vertical section using crimpers and a high step, to find yourself below a very easy slab. (crux, 5.6/5.6+) (The crux feels surprisingly exposed and committing for so short and otherwise easy of a climb.)\n\n From there, stroll up very easy, Super Slab-like terrain to the top-out, where a number of gear anchor options await you.

Many gear anchor options at top. \n\n  Be aware: the route and pro wander for the first half or so of the climb. \n\n  Be warned: Top-roping is not advisable without extreme caution, as you will run the risk of the climber falling over the left edge at the crux, where a scary swing over knife-sharp edges awaits. The same logic holds for the leader and the second; the leader should place pro in the easy terrain to help limit the second's potential to go over the left edge.

It starts off in a nice and mellow corner and then eventually turns into a nasty trail of small nickel edge sized crimps up a slightly overhanging wall.  Bring one small cam for the bottom.  Crimpy and intense on the skin.  The route finishes on the technical, exciting, and slopey finish of Psycho Jap.  Ryan fell off the top out twice before sending.  \n\n  This is probably the hardest climb at Chatfield Hollow.","protection":"Glue-Ins.","location":"Psycho Jap wall."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,a2f1ea01-91f2-59f1-b724-e30fafb7d4e8,d7198222-562b-5689-8eb7-e0853b5f80b6,57882aad-e929-5ae3-89ac-c1f3fa4c53fd","pathTokens":["USA","Connecticut","Eastern Coastal Slope","Chatfield Hollow Main Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":4,"label":"5.12c"},{"count":2,"label":"5.6"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10b/c"},{"count":2,"label":"5.9"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.10d"},{"count":2,"label":"V5"},{"count":4,"label":"5.5"},{"count":3,"label":"5.9-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a/b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.7"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c/d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13a/b"},{"count":2,"label":"5.4"},{"count":1,"label":"V4"},{"count":1,"label":"5.3"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":2,"label":"5.12d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12-"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11b/c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.13b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":33,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":14,"intermediate":8,"advanced":10,"expert":1}},"sport":{"total":14,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":11,"expert":3}},"bouldering":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}},"tr":{"total":22,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":10,"intermediate":9,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":14,"intermediate":10,"advanced":21,"expert":3}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.59364,41.36478]},"bbox":[-72.59423913355525,41.36433033981814,-72.59304086644474,41.36522966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"106051782","area_id":"V4gqrekpWuOJrMHz+kxT/Q==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-72.59423913355525,41.36433033981814],[-72.59304086644474,41.36433033981814],[-72.59304086644474,41.36522966018186],[-72.59423913355525,41.36522966018186],[-72.59423913355525,41.36433033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Chatfield Hollow's Main Wall is the crown jewel of all the rope climbing in and around Chatfield State Park. People have been climbing here at the Main Wall since the early 1970's and new routes are still going up here today. The Main Wall at Chatfield has a good diversity routes in a beautiful hardwood forest setting. Chatfield's metamorphic gneiss rock is distinctively different from Central CT's trap rock. It has exquisitely featured grey and gritty overhanging walls, roofs, aretes, cracks, and slabs with a good mixture of grades for all climbers from a beginner climbing 5.3 to an expert climbing 5.13s. You'll be amazed by the holds you have to use on the routes here: finger cracks, jugs, huge slopers, underclings, edges, pockets, and razor blade crimps.What is unique here, unlike many other Connecticut climbing areas, is that all styles of climbing live in harmony here. You can climb traditional gear protected routes, mixed routes, or pure sport climbs. Chatfield is a great place to climb a lot of routes in a day. It is compact and there are a lot of good routes within a close space. Some great moderates include the Trad Crack, Clark Bar Crack, Kyles Corner, and Super Slab. If you are looking to test yourself check out the Anarchist, Zeitgeist, Shape Shifter, Cold Vein, Its Own Spirit or the massive link-up of the Modern Collective. All these routes are different and they all pack a unique style of punch from bouldery to technical. Last but definitely not least, the traditionally protected crack routes here are some of the best in the state. Routes like Forearm Frenzy and Wallow In the Hollow will test your knowledge of gear placement and your climbing talents. These routes are classics and should not be missed if you are able to climb them.If new to the area and you are coming here for the first time bring a rope, some quick draws, and a standard rack with lots of small and medium cams. Be very careful when you are walking on the delicate thin soils of the cliff top to set up your top ropes. Try as much as possible to tread lightly in this fragile environment. Walk on rock as much as possible. You'll see some dead trees and battered vegetation and muddy trails from years of top-roping use/abuse. Walk on established trails or bare rock when you are setting up your anchors. Also please pick up any trash you might see on the way in or at the cliff. Let's keep Chatfield great for the next generation of climbers to come."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":48,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:12.027Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:14.335Z"}
