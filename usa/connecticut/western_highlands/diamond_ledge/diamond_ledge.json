It is a typically shady main cliff that maxes out at ~60ft high. The rock is a unique blend of gneiss and sharp quartz asperities. Routes at the main cliff range from 5.6 ~ 5.11+ and there is some room to expand. The cliffs on this property have been lookout points for many years and have had documented climbing since the 1970s.There is another ~45 foot tall cliff beyond the main cliff a couple hundred yards if you cut through the woods diagonally on climber's left of the main cliff. If you have information about the several routes there, please post, it looks like they haven't seen much love in a while. If you take the main broad hill trail up to the lookout where the foundation is this lookout sits atop the upper cliff.There are also a handful of boulders in the Diamond Ledges area, although they are not well documented and often require cleaning.- A cluster of boulders is located several dozen yards diagonally through the woods to the climber's right of the main cliff, they can be seen from the footpath that rounds to the top of the cliff if there is little/no foliage. - There is another round plump boulder located directly off broad hill main trail on the way to the upper cliff lookout.- There is also another \"warm up\" bouldering wall near the upper cliff lookout. This wall is to the climber's left of the upper cliff, for an easier approach take a right through the woods a couple hundred feet before the foundation at the lookout. Diamond ledges has several other rock outcroppings that exist in the slope north/northwest behind the main cliff. Much of these rocks have not been climbed due to quality and choss. Take care to stay away from houses on Broad Hill if you choose to adventure and search for new routes/boulders. Parking is located in a small dirt lot at a chain gate and a library box. Please carpool if possible especially on weekends, this parking can get full from walkers and climbers. DRIVE SLOW (less than 10 MPH) up Broad Hill, there are horses and houses close to the road, driving inappropriately could harm access."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":13,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:13.936Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:00:17.459Z"}
