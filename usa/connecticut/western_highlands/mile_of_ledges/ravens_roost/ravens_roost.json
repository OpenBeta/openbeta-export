Super featured, with a lot of climbing for such a compact area. An independent line every 4 or 5 feet if you want. Big horizontals, with great crimpers and juggy holds similar to climbing at the gunks. But the rock is peppered with weird pockets, that make it unique and very interesting climbing. Steep and pumpy, most routes are harder than 5.8- 5.9. Most could be trad led, but watch out for rock quality . Its mostly solid, with a few crumbly spots. All in a nice quiet wooded setting with no road noise. I call it ravens roost , as it had a nest full of fledgling ravens about 3/4 of the way up , last time i was there."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:14.850Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:56.317Z"}
