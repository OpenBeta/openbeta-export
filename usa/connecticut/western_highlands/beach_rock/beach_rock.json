There is short top roping and bouldering on schist rock.  \n\n  From mday: Great fun. Pumpy slightly over hanging bulgy face good quality rock. Climbs like Muscle beech 10+ (gravity waves ??) crack 11, some other good 10s and 11s. Unfortunately patrolled by resevoir police and they will boot you if you are found here."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:13.936Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:31:46.728Z"}
