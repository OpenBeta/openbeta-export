Very sunny, faces south east.  230 foot crag, mostly lower angle slab.  Rock type is similar to rumney like schist.  This area is very secluded, in fact there is no obvious trail into the base.  Make no mistake, this crag is in the deep woods, we almost got carried away by the black flies.  You'll need a map and compass, and the skills to use them to get in and out of the Grizzly Cliff. \n\n  You may encounter wildlife that the Dept. of Environmental Protection denies exists.  We almost called this the Cougar Crag. Nothing burries a deer half in the ground but big cats.   \n\n  History:  I have talked to some folks about climbing here.  Bill \"Sully\" Sullivan, Don Pelletier, Bob Blake, and Randy Noble have explored here.  Mike Cox and I were pleasently surprised at what we found.  It was a fun diversion, but it's not nearly as classic as central Connecticut's traprock."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":3,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T05:56:13.935Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:16:55.185Z"}
