Around 1.5 miles in, just after passing beneath a large overhanging Chossy wall, focus on the cliffline.  Look for a natural arch key hole at the top of a boulder, followed by a very clean, recessed area of vertical wall. Just past this, keep looking at the base of the cliff for a small cave opening directly behind a large Ash tree.  If you see a large, egg shaped boulder then you have just passed it!  Turn around and look closer.  The cave drops down below eye level looking from the trail, so keep your eyes peeled!"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,9fcc0586-276e-51ca-ab53-0eec6dcc215e,cccbe72a-c2bc-56e3-9adf-e4ac4af6559c,6d1c5ca7-c28f-5f08-adf1-84b256ef2137","pathTokens":["USA","Illinois","Cove Hollow","Cove Hollow Trail South"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V6"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":1}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-89.30135,37.62665]},"bbox":[-89.30191774862529,37.62620033981814,-89.30078225137471,37.62709966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116693030","area_id":"bRxcp8KPXwit8YSyVu8hNw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-89.30191774862529,37.62620033981814],[-89.30078225137471,37.62620033981814],[-89.30078225137471,37.62709966018186],[-89.30191774862529,37.62709966018186],[-89.30191774862529,37.62620033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"Secluded, scenic area along the western shore of Cedar Lake accessed from Boat dock road trail head.  This is the southern section of the Cove Hollow Trail #385.  After roughly a mile, the broken, east facing cliff system continues all the way to the Cove Hollow area.  Many good boulder problems ranging in style and difficulty are to be found, but will require some work on your part.  Bring a brush and an eye for lines.  This is a beautiful place, and not the trash covered, graffitied amphitheatre of the northern section.  Let’s make sure it stays that way by practicing strong LNT ethics.  Please stay on established trails and limit climbing related impacts."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:28.255Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:13.296Z"}
