This is a real bad boy. You can identify by the pike shaped impression on the left of the route, and by the spike of doom below... Moderately easy; a few little slopey holds/ insecure crimps. Crux is a few committing moves leading to a scary and insecure topout. Avoid choss to left and right of route. rock is solid in the middle.\n\n BE ADVISED There is a broken wooden post threatening to impale any would-be senders who happen to fall far enough to land on it.
