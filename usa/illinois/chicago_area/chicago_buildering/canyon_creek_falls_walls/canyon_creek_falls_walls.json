It does not get much sun so it stays wet for a long time after a rain. The best looking wall is right next to the water fall and is solid rock, which is pretty neat. the others have more moss/lichen on them. So far every time I have visited this location it was too wet to climb, hence why there are no problems set yet. I am thinking that they will be better in the fall. If you go and are able to climb it be sure to add the problem to this page. Also should mention its a bit of a highball."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:28.924Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:13.877Z"}
