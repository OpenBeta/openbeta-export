The wall is located in the parking lot of a business named Englewood construction. It gets lots of sun and there are lots of bugs. Its super crumbly so you will have to check each hold before putting all your weight on it. The wall is nice and long and great for traversing, but not so great for toping out. If you decide to climb here there is plenty of room for new problems and we hope that people put more up. After you finish climbing there be sure to move all the rocks that have fallen off the wall out of the parking lot and up against the base of the wall; we would like to keep it clean so we don't get banned from there."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:28.907Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:13.964Z"}
