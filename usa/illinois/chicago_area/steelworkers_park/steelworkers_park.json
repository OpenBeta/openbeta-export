Most of the route you can cheat the crack a bit with bonus features on the sides, especially the two boreholes, but towards the top you are committed into the crack for a couple moves.  Bits of iron sticking out give an easy topout up and left, but don't forget to place a final directional cam or clip the I-beam if you are anchoring off the main barrel.  You can climb up the regular wall and set a TR in the same way. The bits of gravel at the very edge of the crack have the potential to pop, but mostly feels fine, and you can place gear solidly into it. ","protection":"BD#0.5, as many as you want.

Former building concrete walls have been outfitted with holds, bolts, and autobelays.Autobelays:Update: No Auto Belays July 2021Currently being developed - there are four autobelays that were padlocked at the time of visit, early July 2018.Leading:The two lead routes at the time of writing this have some pieces missing - there are two lines of bolts, but only a single bolt at the top and not a proper two-bolt anchor for cleaning gear at the time of posting. Can top out and rap off the autobelay support beams but that is not the intention. Can also leave a 'leaver biner' on the bolt and lower, or backclimb using jugs since these climbs are extremely easy.My advice for safely leading the lead climbs is suggestive only and should not be relied on for your safety, if you do not understand safe leading outdoors find an experienced climber, and see the resources available on-line and in book form. The park needs to install a second bolt at the top for cleaning. There are also no lead bolts on the routes using the volumes and roofs. Bouldering:There is also a bouldering traverse set to the left of the roped climbs.Property Access: Chicago Park District project with rules posted on wall.All climbs in the 5.2 - 5.7 range at time of posting July 2018"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:28.250Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:40.198Z"}
