It tops out at over 15 ft and is a slab-style boulder until the very end. The name \"Nutri Grain comes from the very crumbly concrete rock that makes up the boulder. This one will take some problem solving and make sure to be careful, the rock isn't all that strong so don't beat on it. The Crux comes just before the top out; look for a small indent in the rock for your right foothold then get a side pull on the arete to bring your left foot up just before you top out.Crash Pads and Spotters HIGHLY recommended!
