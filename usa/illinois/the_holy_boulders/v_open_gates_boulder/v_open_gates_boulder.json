Perhaps an FA by me -- likely a barefoot first ascent. Start on Chocolate and Cheese V2 on the Open Gates Boulder. Traverse left then slightly down into the middle of Open Gates V4/5. Finish up by executing the crux of Open Gates and topping it out. Initially FA'd barefoot by me, which probably made it harder than it had to be -- but also more fun. Felt like a V7 or a soft V8 since I couldn't get the left foot down to the jug foot for the crux of Open Gates -- some other beta would probably soften this up a bit so some repeats are welcome!","protection":"","location":"Walk in from the parking on the side of the road that a line of cars usually parks at.
