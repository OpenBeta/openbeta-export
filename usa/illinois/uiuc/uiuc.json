Ranging from easy boulder problems to trad and offwidth, there's something for everyone. Because of the considerable distance from any real crag, some students decide to \"builder\" to get their outdoor fix. Many of these climbs would be considered soloing, as falling 2+ stories onto concrete is not something you walk away from. Be warned. Don't trust fake rock facades on some of these buildings, they may not take your weight. Do not ever damage the University's buildings, as they are state property. It's best not to bring crash pads or any pro/ropes to these climbs as that will attract attention. Be warned, there are hundreds of cameras on campus and all of these climbs are probably within range of a camera. Tapes are stored for 120 days and then permanently deleted unless specifically saved, for what it's worth. Don't give anyone a reason to check the footage."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:29.650Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:41.983Z"}
