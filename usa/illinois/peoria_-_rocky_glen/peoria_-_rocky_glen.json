A nice parking lot and new entrance to Rocky Glen has been added to Kickapoo Creek Road. Peoria Park District has recently posted a trail map at the entrance, along with a new trail, that is well marked, and leads to the spray painted sandstone formations. At the opposite end of the small creek that flows through the Glen is an abandoned coal mine entrance that is welded shut. "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:29.650Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:21.340Z"}
