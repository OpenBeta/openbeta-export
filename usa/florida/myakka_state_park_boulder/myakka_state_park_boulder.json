There is a plaque located on the front of the boulder indicating that the park was designated in 1966. \n\n  There is no other stone located in the park, and while bringing climbing shoes could be fun, you would likely go here to ride on an air boat or see the forest canopy via a nature walk, where you can gain some more elevation by stepping up to the top of a 76 foot wooden tower that rises above the tree tops.
