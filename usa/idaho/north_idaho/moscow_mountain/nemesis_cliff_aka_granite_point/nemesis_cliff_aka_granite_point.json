Getting a rope set up on this can be a little tricky. I safely set up a TR by building a gear anchor in a crack at the top of the cliff, fixing a static line, rapping down and over to the top of the climb, and using that same static line slung around an obvious boulder above the route. That system provided both stability and a directional for this line. Â As far as difficulty goes, the more left you go the easier it is. Mid to high 10 difficulty on the left of the arete and solid 5.11 if you stay on the arete itself. This route is sort of like a V0 boulder problem sitting on top of 15 feet of 5.6.
