You will come to an old tree that you go under and to the left of. On the left side of this tree you will clip a bolt and climb up to a two bolt belay anchor (5.8)\n\nPitch 2:\n\nThis pitch is money and climbs up a steep, thin finger crack interspersed with a few bolts and gear placements until you reach a steep head wall. This is the 5.11d part. It does not protect and so a three bolt ladder was added to aid or free climb through this section up to a triangular shaped ledge with a gear belay behind a small tree (5.11d or 5.10 A1)\n\nPitch 3\n\n: Straight off of the belay ledge is a difficult move up a steep section. Here your partner might have to cradle his/ her hands for you to put your foot into and so lift you up so you can reach better holds. Continue up on gear until you reach a belay ledge with a Lost Arrow piton and single expansion\n\nbolt (5.10)\n\nPitch 4:\n\nClimb straight up to a ledge and then begin traversing up and left under the roofy, yellow, overhung section. Here you will notice a ledge system you could traverse right if for some reason the party needed to bail. As you traverse you will go over some spooky “A, B, C blocks” with great exposure. Top out just to the right of Oka-Bates (5.9)","protection":"Mixed route: gear to three inches & bolts","location":"The route can be reached by hiking down Gunsights’ skiers left Ridge line to a notch where a ramp leads down To the North Face. Look for a scree pile that buttresses out from the face and hike to the top of it.
