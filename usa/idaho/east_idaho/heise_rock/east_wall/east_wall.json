Follow arete/chimney through jugs and pockets. Things get a bit slick and crimpy right before the roof.  The crux is either the obvious roof two-thirds the way up or the first 15 ft of the climb.  You can get over the roof by pulling into a large undercling and reaching over for hidden jugs.  Be careful using the undercling as it seems a bit loose.  Possibly an easier way over the roof is to use the crack 3 feet to the right.  Due to the polished rock from all the traffic, this route is tricky for the first few bolts, but I still wouldn't give it a 5.10a.","protection":"4 bolts to chains.  If you don't like runouts, bring a nut to put into the crack once you're over the roof otherwise you'll have 15 ft of rope out by the time you hit the chains (although the last part is more like a scramble).","location":"Rock-A-Bye Baby goes up the obvious arete on the east wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"I0tFzcfsUJiKBZFRcg8/eg==","name":"The Devil in Miss Jones","yds":"5.10b","grades":{"yds":"5.10b","french":"6a+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.6744,43.6361]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"106217697","mp_crag_id":"106215710","climb_id":"I0tFzcfsUJiKBZFRcg8/eg==","areaRef":"8z7+2UzRVv6ooB0N2QZXdw=="},"content":{"description":"Traverse up ramp on East wall.
