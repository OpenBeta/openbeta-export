Sit start left hand low and a right hand on a good flat edge. For me I found it easier to cross left hand to a good incut and bump the right hand to a pinch above the incut. Then move left and start compressing. The crux is throwing right hand to the lip. To moderate top out.\n\nDisclaimer: The hold you throw to on the lip broke in half on the FA and I foresee it breaking entirely in the future. In the spirit of that I did the line again using a 1/4 pad crimp slightly left of the original hold.\n\nI think if you use the original, it's probably V7. New way V8.","protection":"2-3 pads.
