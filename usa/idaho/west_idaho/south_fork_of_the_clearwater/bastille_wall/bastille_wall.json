This route can be approached several ways: walking below the start of Stony Staircase, scrambling up directly from the highway, or climbing 35 Miles Per Hour.  It begins near a large dead tree on the ground in a shallow groove with a bush in it.\n\nP1)  Climb past a few bolts under the white right-facing, arching wall to the lone dead tree on a ledge.\n\nP2) Go up the crack above, to a bolt then traverse right onto a ledge with a two bolt belay.\n\nP3) The third pitch can be climbed three ways, depending on how hard you want to make it.\n\n1)\t5.8 A0.
