The second pitch starts with a bit of a runout, but the climbing is easy.\n\nP1) From the left side of the boulder-covered approach ledge, climb the funky right facing corner and slab (3) to an au cheval move.  Head left on a small ledge system past a bush and a 2 bolt belay. 5.6 100\n\nP2) Climb off the ledge straight up or right (right being easier), then move left to a hidden-from-below bolt after about 40.  Climb the flake/cracks above to a 2 bolt anchor. 5.6 100\n\nP3) Continue up and left to the right-facing slanting dihedral and climb it to its top.  The belay is best positioned just above the first stunted tree. 5.5 60\n\nP4) Scramble left to the Y shaped rappel tree.","protection":"Gear to 3\"","location":"Scramble up and right from the main gully system onto a boulder strewn ledge."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,fba3ca5d-e0d9-5b59-848b-ac98e6d3b3ad,f956d297-58e8-5dcd-86e2-1c544d110fad,5e8ef5d2-3eca-5d87-a0aa-a689179cbf1d,16f53e9c-f7bc-5a40-92e2-6d975649e417","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","West Idaho","South Fork of the Clearwater","Lightning Dome","Lightning Dome - Right Side"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.85298,45.82036]},"bbox":[-115.85362521959053,45.81991033981814,-115.85233478040945,45.82080966018188],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108042683","area_id":"FvU+nPe8WkCS4m2XVknkFw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:30.641Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:43.666Z"}
