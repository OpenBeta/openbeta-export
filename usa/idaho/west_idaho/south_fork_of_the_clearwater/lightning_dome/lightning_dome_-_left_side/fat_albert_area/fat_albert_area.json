Either way this is the most classic and unique climb on the Clearwater.  This good beginners lead follows a clean dihedral for about 25 meters before tunneling underneath a natural arch to the belay.  Dont miss it!  It is nearly impossible to top rope this route since lowering through the arch isnt easily accomplished and the pendulum is nasty!\n\nP1)  Start up the low angle corner using hand jams (superb!) and laybacking until forced to undercling the roof at the top.  Just as things start looking desperate, squeeze into the arch and pop out on the belay ledge.","protection":"Rack to 3 with doubles or triples in 2-3","location":"This route climbs the obvious arch in the middle of Lightning Dome.
