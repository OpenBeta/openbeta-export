There isn't much to hold onto but small crimps, pinches and slopers near the top. It's a quick climb, but it has three variations.\n\n(L to R) The milky looking crack is a tough climb, but it's possible to reach the top on this line. The center variation converges to the right's line about half way up. The left and right lines are a bit off-center, so care must be taken when falling.\n\nThe rock cleaves quite a bit, so there are foot chips a plenty.","protection":"Top Rope only so far. Not bolted yet, although the rock at the top is solid enough for top rope anchors. There are two boulders that provide redundant protection opportunities. Bring plenty of webbing or an extra gym rope. The boulders are big and the distance to the cliff edge is about 15 ft.","location":"The route is easy to locate once your at Tiger Wall (the first cliff face you see after heading up around the bend up the pass after parking at Rattlesnake station's historical marker turnoff). The climb is on an independent pillar toward the right of the cliffs. It has a milk fountain looking crack to the left and a pedestal at the base of that crack.\n\nGetting to the top of the cliff is an easy scramble up the right (or left) side around the back of the pillar. It is a little exposed, so leashing up is a good idea (as always!).\n\nThe bottom belayer has the option of anchoring in on a boulder in front of the climb."},"__v":0},{"_id":"6A1FTpeIVrq4cOKk/y2P/A==","name":"Eagle Powers","yds":"5.7","grades":{"yds":"5.7","french":"5a"},"fa":"Grant Smith","type":{"trad":true,"tr":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.5552,43.2027]},"left_right_index":999999,"mp_id":"109147072","mp_crag_id":"108222409","climb_id":"6A1FTpeIVrq4cOKk/y2P/A==","areaRef":"Ht7c+BjqVGmzW0gr2JLrIg=="},"content":{"description":"First ten feet border on a scramble, the rest of the climb follows a dihedral crack to the top.
