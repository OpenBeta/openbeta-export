Closer inspection revealed a fun ridge scramble! This ridge climbs toward the summit of Mack/Numnut Peak. It is perfect for testing new approach shoes or alpine training.\n\nThe highlight of the ridge (first two sections) is 1000 feet long and gains 500 feet. With an average slope of 45 degrees. Exposure on the ridge is mostly minimal, but there are some spicy sections. Opportunities abound to hop on and off the ridge. Various ways exist to climb the ridge, creating a custom adventure from 3rd class to easy 5th class.\n\nRoute:\n\nFirst section: Rock Fin\n\nThe beginning of the ridge starts at an intersecting creek bed. This first section is steep, fun, and ends shortly after a rock fin.\n\nSecond section: Towers\n\nThe second section contains several distinct towers, offering the cruxes of the route. An unmistakable White Pinnacle \"The Flaming Sword\" is found during this section. This is the most engaging and exposed section. There is a rock cairn marking the end of this section.\n\nThird section: Discontinuous Wrap-up\n\nAfter the towers the ridge become discontinuous and less steep. You can hike a wandering animal trail or do an occasional third class problem.\n\nOnce you have topped out the ridge you can continue to the summit of Mack/Numnut Peak, or run down one of the various ridges. Either way it's a great workout with an alpine rock feel.\n\nI first summited the ridge at sunrise, hence the name: “Till Dawn Ridge.\"\n\nThe ridge is likely a dike of the Snake River Plain made of basalt with intruding granite.\n\nI am sure that I wasn't the first to spot or climb this ridge, but I could not find any information on it.","protection":"This could be a great place to practice alpine rock skills and placing protection. I personally found no protection was necessary. However, loose death blocks abound. Be careful on what you pull!","location":"From the pull out parking area: A faint trail to the power poles and beyond may be found left (west) of the pullout parking area. This path goes by the large fallen tree. From the power poles continue up the ridge, and finally left (west) around a hill to the start of the ridge.\n\nThis steep approach takes approximately 25 mins to one hour and involves ~900 foot gain in just under a half mile.\n\nPull out parking area:\n\n43.609936, -115.945275\n\nStart of Till Dawn Ridge:\n\n43.6164870, -115.9453759"},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,fba3ca5d-e0d9-5b59-848b-ac98e6d3b3ad,3aa36f2e-47bb-596b-a4d7-ff988a0b1431","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","West Idaho","Mack/Numnut Peak"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"Easy 5th"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.95676,43.62422]},"bbox":[-115.95738118031566,43.623770339818144,-115.95613881968434,43.62466966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"118721973","area_id":"OqNvLke7WWuk1/+YigsUMQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.95738118031566,43.623770339818144],[-115.95613881968434,43.623770339818144],[-115.95613881968434,43.62466966018186],[-115.95738118031566,43.62466966018186],[-115.95738118031566,43.623770339818144]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:34.235Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:20.680Z"}
