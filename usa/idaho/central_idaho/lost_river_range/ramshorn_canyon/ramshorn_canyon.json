The climbing is technical steep slab climbing with occasion steeper bulges. Good foot work makes this route go down much easier, maybe not the route for your blown out cruisers!\n\nP1: 5.11a climb up moderate terrain to a couple of technical cruxes back to back. Follow up to bolted anchors.\n\nP2: 5.11a more technical steep slab with some cool crack features to navigate through. belay from bolted anchor.\n\nP3: 5.11a/b I thought this was the hardest and most sustained pitch with some challenging moves off the belay over a bulge then lessening into 5.10 terrain and back into sustained techy climbing until the anchors. Bolted anchors.\n\nP4: 5.10d very enjoyable tachnical climbing through a bulge and cracks.\n\nP5: 5.10c an awesome finish w/ a great view\n\nRap route with single 70m or do short rappel off backside with easy descent down gully to left (70m only for rapping the route!!)","protection":"bolts","location":"Look for bolts starting just right of start of The Business of Fancy Dancing. look for large leftward traversing flake up wall.
