The first 1.5 miles is a mellow hike at a low angle with an amazing view of towering cliffs on either side. After a while, the trail will begin to dissipate and leave you to your route finding abilities. Keep climbing up through the pines whilst log hopping and scrambling over scree fields. At this point, you should be reminiscing of the highly trafficked well-marked trails of more popular peaks like Borah. Stay low in the canyon until you hit a fork about 2 miles in, I turned left and traveled about another 1/2 mile before heading right and straight up through the tree line. once you exit the tree line the route should be obvious. Head up to the saddle below the summit, take the east ridge the whole way up. Staying left of the ridge will keep you on continuous scree, some will opt for the more technical option weaving between the ridge. Enjoy the seldom climbed summit and views, you will likely be the only party of the day. Descend the way you came.","protection":"Trekking poles will be appreciated by most","location":"Drive as far up Middle Canyon as your vehicle will allow and head straight up the canyon."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,02ac3e51-11bc-5ac4-a837-7c27e05506b4,adecc309-9c54-5f6e-95a5-3dc8bf795a41,83af738a-46a0-5fa7-b45a-934840fb947e","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","Central Idaho","Lemhi Range","Saddle Mountain"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"3rd"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"snow":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.17539,44.24517]},"bbox":[-113.17601770074009,44.24472033981814,-113.17476229925991,44.245619660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119282241","area_id":"g69zikagX6e0WpNIQPuUfg=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:23.740Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:32.917Z"}
