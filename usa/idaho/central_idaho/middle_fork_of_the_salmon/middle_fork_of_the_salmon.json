The first time I was there we had a rope but didn't have any luck getting to the top to set a rope.  The next time I didn't have a rack so we just floated by.  Looks like a fun climb but unfortunately you have to start right out of the raft - there's no ledge at the bottom.  There were slings at the top when I first saw it but I didn't see any this time.  You'll probably have to leave a sling or two to get down.\n\nThe route is a nice handcrack (see the pictures) - there's room for plenty of other routes if you want to spend a day there.  It's not a very tall crag compared to the upper part of Impassible Canyon but looks like good rock.  Hopefully this will inspire someone to climb it and post a better description.  The rating comes from the Matt Leidecker book.","protection":"It looks like medium gear for the most part","location":"This is across from the Cliffside camp, near the end of the canyon.
