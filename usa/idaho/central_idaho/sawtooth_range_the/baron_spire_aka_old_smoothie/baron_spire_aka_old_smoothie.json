The crux second pitch could be at home in Yosemite! The crux on the third pitch is unfortunately dirty and wasn't redpointed on lead on the first ascent; it will hopefully clean up with a couple more ascents.\n\nPitch 1: Stem up a dihedral of white rock. The crack is heavily vegetated, but fortuitous face holds make the climbing easy. Follow a fun clean handcrack up the left side of a flake to the blocky belay alcove. 5.8 80'\n\nPitch 2: Jam the clean varying handcrack up the flaring left-facing dihedral (5.10c) until it rolls over into splendid and sustained flared hands (5.9) up to a hanging belay where the crack converges with a groove/crack on the right. Immaculate rock and stellar climbing make this a stellar pitch! 5.10c 90'\n\nPitch 3: Take the right-trending flared groove/crack, which is dirty and cruxy (5.10c) for the first 10'. Above this short tough spot, the climbing is sustained and intriguing and the rock clean. Belay in a blocky stance where the groove wraps around the prow to the right and into the main corner system. 5.10c 190'\n\nPitch 4: A short easy traverse on exposed blocky ledges into the main corner system. Belay where convenient. 5.4 40'\n\nPitch 5: Weave and wander up the right-hand margin of the massive corner system following the line of least resistance and best rock. Be careful with the rather dubious rock on this long pitch.

Not the worst idea to stay roped up through this traverse.\n\nP5: The infamous Beckey bolt ladder! Bust out your aiders, think light thoughts, and hope none of the manky old buttonheads rip on you.
