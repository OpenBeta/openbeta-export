Follow the gully until you encounter a small ledge with a two pin belay.\n\nP2 - Continue up the gully, bypassing a roof on the right and reaching a two bolt belay shortly thereafter.\n\nP3 - Climb a crack in a left facing flare until it peters out, then climb straight up to the groove above.  Pull around a small roof on cool holds and you should find a three pin belay on a ledge to the left.\n\nP4 - Follow a thin crack in a shallow right facing corner until you find a good spot to belay (we didn't quite reach the trees)\n\nP5 - Easy climbing leads to the trees if you are not there yet\n\nWalk off to the right and back to your packs","protection":"Single rack to 2\" should be fine","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,02ac3e51-11bc-5ac4-a837-7c27e05506b4,8266fe69-367d-5b54-85ff-1179675b468e,66191725-d2e2-5c59-a45b-f110f640f91c","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","Central Idaho","Sawtooth Range, The","Super Slab"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.6"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.97802,44.08519]},"bbox":[-114.9786460007357,44.08474033981814,-114.97739399926428,44.08563966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"109455436","area_id":"ZhkXJdLiXFmkW/EQ9kD5HA=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:34.823Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:27.566Z"}
