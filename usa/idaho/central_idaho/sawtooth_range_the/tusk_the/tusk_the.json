Pretty hard to miss and ends at a prominent ledge with trees and boulders.  Probably the best pitch of the route, although not my favorite [9+].\n\nP2 - Move belay climbers left to just below prominent left facing dihedral.  Climb blocky terrain to the dihedral above [9].\n\nP3 (my favorite) - Continue up the dihedral.  A little grundgy, on a little exfoliating rock.  Has some lieback and wide then goes through a small roof into an obvious spacey nook above with a crack in the back to setup the belay (save small gear/nuts). [10b]\n\nP4 - From the nook, traverse with finesse around the corner to the face/nice crack.  Cruise up however don't follow this too high as you need to be looking for a weakness to the right.  Beta spray: the higher you go, the harder it will be to traverse right.  Once you traverse right you will find yourself high up above the main Tusk face on a plush ledge. [10-]\n\nP5 - Lot of options.  Find weaknesses by going up and traversing (extending pieces a good idea).  Few heads up spots.  I took this pitch pretty high up to a nice big ledge.  [9]\n\nFrom here, its a straight forward scramble to the summit over blocky terrain.  Make sure to tag the summit, but only 1 member of the group at a time will fit unless you are very comfortable with your partner.\n\nDescent:\n\nFrom the summit, downclimb to the north (away from the lakes) and behind the summit block [Cl. 4] to a tat nest.  Rap off to the right (away from the Elephants perch).  70m rope gets you down with 1 rap but just barely so watch the ends!!!  Scamper down the easy gulley towards the lakes, optional rap at the very end (similar the Perch descent but less steep scree and shorter).","protection":"Gear up to #4 but could get away without the 4","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,02ac3e51-11bc-5ac4-a837-7c27e05506b4,8266fe69-367d-5b54-85ff-1179675b468e,1677b7fe-4aee-5bc8-a702-eb0607638c31","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","Central Idaho","Sawtooth Range, The","Tusk, The"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.972,44.06749]},"bbox":[-114.97262581351423,44.067040339818135,-114.97137418648576,44.06793966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"117836194","area_id":"Fne3/kruW8inAusGB2OMMQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-114.97262581351423,44.067040339818135],[-114.97137418648576,44.067040339818135],[-114.97137418648576,44.06793966018187],[-114.97262581351423,44.06793966018187],[-114.97262581351423,44.067040339818135]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:34.825Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:33:21.551Z"}
