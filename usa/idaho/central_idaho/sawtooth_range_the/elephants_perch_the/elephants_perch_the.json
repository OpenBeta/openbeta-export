The name is derived from the obvious thorn bush which sits in the middle of Pitch 5 and, in the subtle words of Cody, you can \"high step the shit out of that bush!\" The route sits on a part of the wall that is often overlooked as many of the other classics on the wall sit either left of right, but if you are looking for an adventure, escape from the crowds or just simply some amazing rock not often touched this is where you want to be.\n\nP1 (5.8): The first pitch is the same as for Boomer's Story, a simple 5.8 up a corner, a short chimney and some airy moves to a good ledge.\n\nP2 (5.12d): Off the left side of the ledge begins one of the best pitches on the Perch, and one of the best alpine pitches I have ever climbed. Exciting and fun climbing leads to a WILD chimney section and up to a decent rest. Get everything you can back and embark on the crux of the pitch and perhaps the route. Pull through a bulge and into an improbable corner. If you're David Copperfield this is no problem. This pitch ends at the original hanging belay set by the first ascentionists.\n\nP3 (5.10+): Pitch 3 pulls back into the corner and makes its way under an airy roof traverse; pull onto a ledge and follow easy terrain to a giant ledge.\n\nP4 (5.11): Pitch 4 is a gem. This is a perfect right-leaning 5.11 fingers and thin hands crack that finishes with a few surprisingly fun OW moves to the anchor.\n\nP5 (5.12+): The Thorn Bush pitch! Start in a dirty crack out right of the belay. Move back left and towards the bush. From here you can either 'highstep the shit out of it' or bear down on a few small crimps, hike a foot and blast to a good flat ledge. Mantle up and get ready for the next crux. The crack here tends to seam out but opens up just when you need it to, or maybe 6\" further than you would like.  Figure your way up into the corner and follow it to a roof. Take the roof out right and climb up to a belay.\n\nP6 (5.12-): Pitch 6 starts out with a few Funk Master Flex stemming moves in a blank corner. Move right at a roof and then follow the killer 5.10 fingers and hands to the bivy ledge. The Bivy ledge is one of the coolest hangs on the Perch and a great place to relax and fuel up before the last of the hard climbing.\n\nP7 (5.11): Off the ledge start up a locker steep finger crack, be warned this is a very sharp crack but sooooo good. When the crack thins step right onto the face and up into a thin hand/ring lock crack. Follow that for about 20 feet then step back left when possible. Follow this through a few roofs and past a couple ledges. A short hard flaring OW section leads you to a good stance and the end of the hard climbing.\n\nFrom this point follow the obvious cracks (5.10) up and right towards the Beckey Tree. From the tree take which ever line you wish to the top.  All the climbing at this point is 5.10 or under.\n\nPitch break down: 5.8, 5.12d, 5.10+, 5.11, 5.12+, 5.12-, 5.11, 5.10, 5.10- (to the Beckey Tree). 3 more pitches of <5.10 to the summit.","protection":"Double rack with lot of draws.

This is a great route that demands a solid lead head to navigate some spicy terrain.\n\nBegin by scrambling up to a tiered ledge system with a couple large trees on the SE corner of the Perch.\n\nP1 (5.7): Shared with Myopia, climb a long series of cracks, corners and blocks passing the belay for the first real pitch of Myopia and continuing a few feet up and right to a good ledge at the base of a long left-facing corner system that forks into two corners up higher (this Y-shaped corner system is an obvious landmark from below).\n\nP2 (5.10): Climb the long corner system being cautious of some loose blocks and hollow stuff. About halfway up this corner you may see some obvious face holds leading to an old bail anchor out left - do not traverse here but continue up the corner to a second line of face holds that also lead out left. This is about 3/4 of the way up the corner. Traverse across the face and then up a thin flake to a stance belay on top of the flake. This is the only uncomfortable belay on the route.\n\nP3 (5.11a PG13): The crux of the route is immediately off the belay. Step left and, using an undercling, make a big reach to the top of the thin flake. Traverse up and right across the top of this flake some distance before reliable pro can be had. At a stance, you can either traverse further right into a short corner system capped by a small roof (a bit of lichen and flakey rock, but good pro), or you can continue straight up the thin flake system (slightly harder?). Either way, the lines merge after about two body lengths at the left edge of the small roof and a welcomed rest at a huge pocket. Above this you'll be glad you brought a #4 Camalot to protect 30' of steep fist crack/liebacking. When the crack abruptly narrows, bust wildly out right on face holds and climb a series of sparsely-protected pillars to the \"Towers Belay\" that Ian mentions in the comments. This is a wild spot!\n\nP4 (5.10+ R): Climb up into a bomb bay roof feature that is plugged by a wedged block, but instead of struggling over this, move around the arete to the right onto an exposed and highly featured face. Wander up this face plugging cams into small pockets for pro, clipping a vintage quarter-incher, and resisting the temptation to move right into a huge corner feature where more bail gear may be enticing you with the promise of an easy escape. Instead work up the face via a thin section to a huge flake above a small foot-ledge. This flake and ledge are located just 10' or so left of the left-most reaching section of the aforementioned huge corner feature. Sling this flake for a belay.\n\nP5 (5.11a R): This is the money pitch. Move out left off the belay to gain an obvious thin seam. Climb this with decent but spaced pro until they (both the seam and the pro) thin to almost nothing. Arrange a nest of RP's and launch with commitment up and rightwards across a face to a small foot ledge beneath a second seam.  Climb this second seam (now more or less back in line with the belay) up to a few tough moves to gain a huge pocket on the left. Protect this as well as possible and then step up with difficulty, clip another vintage bolt, and climb 15' of breath-taking face climbing to access a shallow, left-facing corner and more protection. I followed this to a prominent dike system and traversed right (being careful of a large loose block) before stepping up to a perfect belay ledge with a small tree, but it would also be possible to continue straight up the corner to this same ledge. Either way you have now joined Astro Elephant.\n\nP6-9 (5.9): Climb the last four pitches of A-E to the very summit of the Perch.

We followed the cleanest and most straightforward variations we saw, and I think if you spent some time cleaning some dirt out of the cracks left of pitches 1 and 3, you could straighten the curves and make this rig even better.  The highlight of the route is pitch 2, a super-clean, super-tech, and super-aesthetic corner system you can see from the ground.  It's the kind that makes the angels sing in harmony when you look at it.  Pitches 3 through 5 are also pretty good, but then the route quality and difficulty goes down a notch or two from there to the top.  You can definitely rappel the route from the top of pitch 4 with a single 70 m rope via slung trees, horns, and fixed passive protection (might need new webbing).  You might be able to make it down pitch 5, also, but I'm not sure.  You certainly could if you fixed a couple of stoppers part way down the pitch.\n\nHere's the pitch by pitch breakdown:\n\nApproach:  Scramble up ~50 ft to a large ledge with some pine trees on it. The P2 R-facing corner is a good landmark to shoot for.  Also, to the left, look for a thin futuristic 1-pitch splitter off this ledge.\n\nP1:  Step right into a 5.8 wide crack in a left-facing corner.  After ~25 ft, mantle out and step right on ledgy ground. Climb up and left via hand cracks behind flakes.  Belay on a large ledge with a slung constriction.  5.8, ~60 ft.\n\nP2:  The biz.  Step left, boulder up past two pretty crappy pins, get a rest, and then fire the thin corner above.  Expect tech-9 stemming and sinker nut placements.  The stems themselves are stable and let you place gear, but moving up, well that's a different story.  After about 80 feet, when the difficulty backs off, switch to a crack system on the right.  Eventually, step left around a bulge to a belay in an alcove. 5.12+/13-, 110 ft.\n\nP3.  Climb up and right out of the alcove on gritty rock (5.9+ slightly run) toward a crack.  Pull a committing bulge that suddenly speeds up the pump clock.  Continue up the shallow right facing corner to another ledge belay.  5.11, 100 ft.\n\nP4.  Get your legs ready for one more short section of thin stemming in the R-facing corner (5.12-) to gain a widening crack.  About 30-40 feet up, cut left around a bulge on big face holds (really fun) to a L-facing corner.  Follow the corner up to a large ledge.  5.12-, 90 ft.\n\nP5:  Continue up the left-facing corner.  It starts thin, but you can use a wide crack on the right wall.  Pull the roof at the top of the corner, squirm up through a short wide section, and belay at a tree visible from the bottom of the pitch.  This pitch looks like it's covered with slippery lichen, but it doesn't really feel that slippery.  5.11-, 115-130 ft.\n\nP.5-6:  The route becomes much less engaging at this point.  Still fun, but much slabbier and with grittier rock.  There are probably numerous ways to continue up from here.  We combined pitches 5 & 6 with a little bit of simulclimbing.  Climb up and right via 5.7 grooves with hand cracks in the back.  Above, cut slightly left to belay at a decent-sized tree on the right side of a large ledge.  5.9+/10-.  230 ft.\n\nP. 7-10:  We combined these into two pitches with some simulclimbing.  From the tree belay, traverse down and left ~100 ft on an easy ledge to a large R-facing corner system.  Climb the corner and continue to angle up and right via cracks and ledges to the top.  5.8, 500 ft.\n\nDescent:  From the top, hike down the standard descent gully with one single rope rappel near the bottom.","protection":"1 set stoppers (extra ~3-7, selected brass optional), 2-3x tiny cams to green camalot, 2x red and gold camalot, single blue #3 and grey #4 camalot.  13-15 QDs and slings.","location":"Left of Becky Routes and right of Mountaineers Route.
