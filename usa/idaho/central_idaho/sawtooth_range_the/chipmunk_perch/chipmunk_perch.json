The ridge consists of four successively higher rock towers (\"horsemen\"). Start at the base of the ridge amid some trees, and pick the route that looks the most interesting.  There are many possible variations, so perhaps the climb could be made easier or harder than the given rating.\n\nAt the top of the 3rd tower you will be looking down into a notch separating you from the 4th tower.  At first it looks like a rappel will be needed to gain the notch, but if you look carefully there is a system of holds and ledges that allows a moderate downclimb (5.6ish).\n\nWe found the most sustained, steepest, and best quality pitches of the route by climbing directly up the 4th tower.\n\nAlthough most of the underlying rock is very good, there are many loose blocks; be sure to set up belays out of the line of fire.","protection":"Single rack to 3\" should have you covered.  With the exception of the 4th tower, most of the cruxes are short, with copious amounts of 5.fun climbing in between.","location":"Directly across the Saddlback Lakes from the Elephant's Perch.  If you look for some trees at the base of the east ridge (the one with the 4 towers) you can't miss it."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,02ac3e51-11bc-5ac4-a837-7c27e05506b4,8266fe69-367d-5b54-85ff-1179675b468e,59fbc5c9-b387-5257-b2c8-4597416a77fb","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","Central Idaho","Sawtooth Range, The","Chipmunk Perch"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-114.9813,44.0604]},"bbox":[-114.98192573856802,44.05995033981814,-114.98067426143197,44.060849660181866],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"108308636","area_id":"WfvFybOHUleyyEWXQWp3+w=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:35.018Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:18:28.071Z"}
