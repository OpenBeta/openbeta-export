Once you've crossed the small scree gulley using decent rock, fight off the bushes and catch the crack (as far lefts as you can go). Once at the crack, make awkward moves with weird & reachy pro to get into the crack feature. Crux is probably in the first 15 feet. Once in the crack, it's fun 5.7/8 alpine-style granite with a couple chimney moves to the top with good (but still dirty) rock.\n\nOne loose flake came off on 2nd ascent (might make for a second funky 5.8+ move?) and route still needs cleaned - helmets needed for anyone at the base.\n\nFinish at the largest tree just above crack system after fighting off a couple more bushes. Look for black 1\" webbing anchor & steel ring on tree from 2019 FA. Use at your own risk.\n\nBelayer should find good stance and chest-level crack for a good nut placement just above top of gulley near some tiny rock outcroppings at base.","protection":"Full rack to #3 Camalot, doubles of #1-3 is helpful. Slings to extend and cordellette for Anchor. Tree anchor with webbing & steel rap ring placed on 5/2019.","location":"From Sawtooth Lodge (especially from the porch of \"The Managers Cabin\"), look NE for the most obvious granite face feature approx. 1/3rd of the way up the valley wall. There's a large crack feature that begins near a very large (and obvious) burned tree. The Crack bears up and left past a roof and ends and standalone pine tree in the upper-middle of the small cliff band.\n\nApproach from the Lodge along FS-524 road and cut up through the trees to the base. Approach is forest, talus/scree, and loose, so exercise caution - and it's STEEP.\n\nBase of climb begins at crack in small gulley. Best belay stance is 5 meters right of the base near some solid rock and bushes. Belay can be protected with a bomber nut placement.\n\nOn the approach, don't get sucked into the crack feature down around the corner to the left (though that could be another route) or the small cracks up and right of the main face.\n\nAdditional routes could easily be TR'd from the tree anchor and there looks to be a great face line over the roof to the right of the top of this route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,02ac3e51-11bc-5ac4-a837-7c27e05506b4,8266fe69-367d-5b54-85ff-1179675b468e,29992abb-9342-51f4-b924-677add314aab","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","Central Idaho","Sawtooth Range, The","Grandjean"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.8+"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"alpine":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-115.16359,44.15801]},"bbox":[-115.16421677279787,44.15756033981813,-115.16296322720211,44.15845966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"120127839","area_id":"KZkqu5NCUfS5JGd63TFKqw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-115.16421677279787,44.15756033981813],[-115.16296322720211,44.15756033981813],[-115.16296322720211,44.15845966018187],[-115.16421677279787,44.15845966018187],[-115.16421677279787,44.15756033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:34.824Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:49.405Z"}
