Start to the left of the afore mentioned corner system, on a ledge at the base of a crack system that splits the slab. There is a single bolt from my anchor for the rope solo FA. It was cleaned and bolted on aid prior to the first free ascent. Climb the crack till it peters out, make a move left past bolts to a bulge, more bolts and pins past easier blocky rock to a DBB up and left. 5.10a\n\nPitch 2. Move directly right across a slabby face to the obvious left facing flake corner. Beautiful crack climbing up this to a mantle move onto the ledge above and DBB. Classic but short.","protection":"Trad gear up to Camelot #3. Include smaller wires and cams. Offsets were useful. 3 bolts and a pin.
