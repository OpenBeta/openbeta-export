Clean, compact limestone. Toes and fingers were numb in March, but it should receive afternoon sun later in the year. Climb the face to the left of chimney, sustained moves with an occasional rest stemming to outside of chimney. There is a slightly run out crux moving right through a bulge about fifty feet up. Look for cam placements in some crystal pockets. At around 100 feet, the chimney jogs out to the left and the climb goes behind it. Polished rock and some squirming gets you through this till you are on top of a large ledge. Then climb the clean hand crack directly to the anchors.DBB.
