At best I was doing this move 1 of every 3 or 4 times from the hang. Linking it from the ground was going to be a heinous task. A few hard exit moves take you into easier terrain and the main rest. Above the rest, an ultra thin, beautiful headwall, 60 feet or more in length remains. The meat of this section is 2 well spaced bolts long, and requires finger strength, creative thinking and a surprising amount of power.
