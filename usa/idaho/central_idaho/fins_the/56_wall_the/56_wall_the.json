Start with a surprisingly hard move off the flake to 3 bolts of easy and sharp climbing angling right.  The business starts as you make your way into the sloper and a very sharp pocket pinch.  One long move gains the last obvious hold until you reach the anchors.  Overall great climbing but docked a star due to the amount of cleaning I had to do up top, the sharpness down low and an anchor setup that isn't ideal.","protection":"bolts to an offset anchor and single biner.","location":"Center of the wall."},"__v":0},{"_id":"wpoCiK3xXAueWv5w5goG/w==","name":"Escape From Choss Angeles","yds":"5.11c","grades":{"yds":"5.11c","french":"6c+"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.08335,43.72956]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"111096263","mp_crag_id":"111096246","climb_id":"wpoCiK3xXAueWv5w5goG/w==","areaRef":"IDMnppr8UJihtBlKV6wnSg=="},"content":{"description":"On the left side of the wall, this has one hard move to gain the pod and a rest, then continue up brown, sharp, and chossy stone to join the seam at the top.
