For a single-pitch rock climb, this one allows you to feel nicely exposed. You've already hiked a couple hundred feet from the canyon floor, so halfway up this route, you're soaring. A great opportunity for a moderate climber to get high in the sky.\n\nNo real crux, just fun, steep and sustained face climbing on the right side of the arete.\n\nJust for fun, an anecdote: My first time climbing this route, I was belaying my climbing partner, and the golden eagle that used to inhabit the canyon (I haven't seen it in nearly two years, sadly), came swooping around the arete, just above my partner's head.
