He said he cleaned out the moss and lichen and discovered a sweet little yosemite like finger/hand crack in a corner.\n\nThe crux comes about mid way, and is easily overcome with some liebacking. Patina face holds adorn the right wall of this vertical right-facing route. I would agree with Bingham's guide, and give this climb 3 stars if not for the long approach for only two climbs on the formation, and shortness of the route. A budding 11a leader would likely appreciate this climb more than anyone.","protection":"The gear is great- it basically places itself, and you have sizing options. Bring a single set  of cams from fingers to off hands. You don't really even need runners. Lower off the chain anchors at the top.","location":"Located on the east face crag that bears its namesake- look for the vertical right facing corner.
