The rock is perfect, and the moves are elaborate, unusual, and hard.  I didn't detect any chipping or other \"funny business\" on this route, which means it's probably the hardest \"natural\" route at the City/Castles.\n\nStart about 10 feet left of the dihedral under a small roof that guards a blunt prow.  This contrived, but fun start includes an inconsequential crux gaining the face above the roof--think \"outside the box\". After getting past the initial face, get a no-hands rest in the corner before the crux.\n\nThe crux climbs the very steep (45 deg) scooped-out hueco features.  I used some very elaborate and odd (even by modern standards) moves to overcome this crux, and I couldn't help but think that when this route was first climbed, these moves would have seemed very unconventional...just more proof of Yaniro's amazing vision and talent for climbing.\n\nThis is a fantastic route, and this little crag is a great place to hang out on a hot day...it stays shady well into late afternoon due to its steep nature.","protection":"bolts","location":"At the Dungeon, there are three routes all squeezed together that kind of confuse things.  The Heretic is the left-most route.  It starts under a small roof and climbs up a blunt prow for the first couple bolts (not in the corner where Ball and Chain starts).
