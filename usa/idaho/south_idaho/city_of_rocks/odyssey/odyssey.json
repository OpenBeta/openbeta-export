This formation was originally known as the \"Hershey kiss\" as its pointy domed top resembles the famous candy. The story is the crack was supposed to be known as \"Ought to See\" (coined by Stan Caldwell?) but erroneously was recorded as Odyssey.  A bolt protected boulder problem guards the opening moves before one can gain the crack. Once in the crack (no small feat!) the climbing is overhanging, athletic, and well protected. The upper section (crux is 11a/b or so) was a bit dirty and quite sharp- you may want to protect those paws with some tape. Dave Bingham advises to \"Sneak past the bizarre bottom crux and then contend with one of the best overhanging jam cracks at the City of Rocks.\" This description leads one to believe the start is really 12a and just requires one unlock a clever solution- I know many who have tried and tried not been able to free the opening moves and establish in the crack. This feels like the most 5.13 12a I've been on in the City. The good news is you can tug on that draw after you fail with the fight of your life and then reach up to the first finger lock in the crack- probably A0 11b- and damn good at that!","protection":"A single bolt protects the balls hard boulder problem start, then bring doubles of .5 to 2.5 inch cams. No anchor- it would be really nice if someone added one.","location":"Approach via the boxtop trailhead and walk down hill until you cross the stream (likely dry in late season) and then follow the loose sandy trail in the circle creek bottom to the Hershey kiss locking formation. Approach time approx 15 minutes. You must walk off the backside of the rock."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,76021131-7623-5f5b-9efb-5dda911ccca8,abbebc02-c1f8-57b0-bcba-ee8efb064ed2,6665bf8f-14d7-56b1-b7fa-1233aff9828d","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","South Idaho","City of Rocks","Odyssey"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10b"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":2,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.70666,42.08032]},"bbox":[-113.70726584276588,42.079870339818136,-113.70605415723412,42.08076966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105866169","area_id":"ZmW/jxTXVrG3+hIzr/mCjQ=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:32.174Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:44.825Z"}
