The rest of the route is lacking.  Start from the ground, just a few feet left of a bush maybe 3 meters up. Climb past the bush and into a right-leaning crack. The rock is lichen-covered, but mostly solid and the grade is moderate.  As you reach solid protection, place it on a long runner, as you are still moving up and right, but the route is about to traverse left under the roof.  Continue on solid jams until the crack ends, and go out left a few meters to an obvious jam-crack and start into the roof on some under-clings and jams- get horizontal and pull into the roof and over it on some technical jams and an edge or two. Footwork is still key, although there is not apparently much for feet. (Hint: This *is* a crack climb, after all.)\n\nAfter the roof you will arrive on a ledge.  While it is possible to belay here, I found it more inviting to traverse left (run it out of suffer the drag) into a cleft, then go up a few ledges on the right side of the cleft and to the cliff-top to belay off of gear.\n\nTo descend, scramble down to the South and find some anchors.
