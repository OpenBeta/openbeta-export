Follow the trail around the north end of Parking Lot Rock.  The large upper west face of Rabbit rock is across from the north end of the east face of Parking Lot Rock.  The base of the climb can be identified by locating some large detached blocks.  The route starts at the right edge of these blocks and continues up the vegetated dihedral.  From a distance this looks like a classic corner.  Unfortunately it isn't; but it is fun to climb anyway.\n\nThe standard descent for the north end of the west face of Rabbit Rock is a rappel from chains on the north end; or to scramble down the north end. We did not do this.  We located some chains just slightly to the south(right) and down the face about 15 feet from the top of the climb.  A 60m rope made it safely down from these chains.","protection":"A variety of gear, trad anchor","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"flbrfiIqUFmoJtrdFf7AhQ==","name":"A-rester","yds":"5.10d","grades":{"yds":"5.10d","french":"6b+"},"fa":"Dan Sperlock","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.72075,42.08358]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"108999267","mp_crag_id":"107595359","climb_id":"flbrfiIqUFmoJtrdFf7AhQ==","areaRef":"FtRrh9TZXzixSm18GnRbIw=="},"content":{"description":"","protection":"","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,76021131-7623-5f5b-9efb-5dda911ccca8,abbebc02-c1f8-57b0-bcba-ee8efb064ed2,52463b99-18c4-5cdb-bcec-8fade08baf21,16d46b87-d4d9-5f38-b14a-6d7c1a745b23","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","South Idaho","City of Rocks","Rabbit Rock","Rabbit Rock -West"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.11d"},{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11+"},{"count":1,"label":"5.11c"},{"count":1,"label":"5.8"},{"count":1,"label":"5.10d"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"sport":{"total":3,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":3,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":1,"intermediate":1,"advanced":4,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.72075,42.08358]},"bbox":[-113.72135587389396,42.08313033981814,-113.72014412610604,42.08402966018187],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"107595359","area_id":"FtRrh9TZXzixSm18GnRbIw=="},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":6,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:32.176Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:44:44.868Z"}
