Power underclings with smears for feet follow the arch to a stance where you then climb direct and surmount the roof to the face above. You then essentially follow the strange vertical white quartz dike surrounded by great patina edges that later become huge jugs.","protection":"Placing extra gear in the crack at the start and after the last bolt is optional. Also you need to use long slings on the bolts for the underclings (at least two) to inhibit rope drag. I suggest placing a small nut to protect the starting corner, then clipping the first bolt with a runner, then backcleaning your nut. After the last bolt, expect a 25 foot 5.8 runout, but a finger sized cam can tame it if you choose.","location":"Farthest left route approached from the redtail trail access area of Rabbit Rock.
