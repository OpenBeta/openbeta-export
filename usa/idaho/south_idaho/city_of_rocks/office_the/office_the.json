About 20M to the right of this is an obvious crack/roof/bombay flare 4M above the ground.  The roof turns into a left facing corner/flake.\n\nClimb up a couple of moves and place #3-#4 Camalot size gear in the bombay.  Traverse left 3' to an obvious edge then do a cool mantle/undercling sequence to get stood up on the edge.  Layback up the flake until you hit easier ground and a bolt.  Continue up typical COR knobby slab face to another bolt, harder & scary if under ~5'9\" tall.  Follow a seam/crack (#1 Camalot) up to an alcove below a clean, vertical or steeper 1/8\" crack.  The crack which takes good nuts is the crux and again is harder if you can't reach a critical fingerlock with your foot on a large knob.

I didn't think this was any better than Silent Partner, but the guidebook and my partner did, so bowing to peer pressure, I'll give it 4 stars.\n\nStart at an obvious thin, straight up crack about 5M right of King of the Hangdogs, the obvious left facing corner.\n\nThe first 15', thin laybacking etc. on thin, left facing flakes, is the crux; decent pro is available for this section but it is tough to place.  If you have a crashpad or springy legs, you might be better off bouldering this section as the landing is smooth.  After you latch the key undercling, marking the end of the crux, there is a straightforward .4 Camalot (gray) placement.  After this, pull up and over a bulge (good pro but strenuous to place) to a good rest.  At the rest, place a nest of RP size nuts and wriggle past another tricky spot.  The climb continues in this fashion, decent but not completely obvious pro with matching moves until another crux is encountered around 2/3 height.  After this the climbing relents somewhat as does the gear.  Note: my 2000 vintage guide gives both cruxes 10+; my partner and I both found the first considerably harder.
