There is some easy climbing up to a deviously hard traverse section to the left.  Some juggy moves lead to a good rest.  More jugs on the lip of a bulge give promise to an easy finish only to encounter an extremely long reach to a thin sloping edge (crux!).  Afterwards, some nice slab move lead to the anchors.\n\nThe rock is decent on this climb, and the route was originally rated 5.11a.  The name of the route should have been a clue to its sandbagged nature.","protection":"A few bolts at the bottom and a few at the top.

There really are no pro options before then, and its about 20' up.  The climbing to it was bit technical for my comfort, and it was a strain to reach it (I'm 6'1\").  A long stick clip would have been nice.\n\nAfterward the climbing eases up considerably with a long runout (possible groundfall potential?) between decent pro placements initially.\n\nThe crux is surmounting the crack at the top.  There is a bolt protecting it.  It didn't really need to be there, as there was decent pro options nearby, but it was nice to have it none-the-less (pro would have potentially taken up a good hand-hold).\n\nThe crux sequence was kind of tricky to figure out.  There are some non-obvious holds that really seemed to help once I found them.  It was very rewarding to have done it, and earned this route a star, in my opinion.","protection":"Mixed with bolts at the cruxes.
