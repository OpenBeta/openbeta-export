Lots of climbing packed in the short 60' of this excellent route, felt hard for 11a.\n\nStart by scampering up a ramp that quickly turns vertical and devious. A small cam can ease your mind as you transition onto the face, clip the 1st bolt and pull a burly crux on patina edges to establish on a ledge. Clip the 2nd bolt and launch up a parallel set of vertical edges that just don't want to feel very good. Another bolt and a puzzling transition onto the now blank face to the left brings you to the dreaded dyno. Either launch up and immediately plummet down (gravity is a bitch) or carefully milk sharp edges and high feet to get to decent crimps and a bolt. Gather yourself and figure out the puzzling crux finish: reach into a small roof way up and left or invent a hold straight up and make something happen. Either way, you might pitch 6\" from the chains...","protection":"5 bolts, chain anchors. Optional small cam before the 1st bolt.\n\nThe last bolt and anchors are shared with the route to the left (Fido). Scary TR as the route traverses left a ways and the bolts are spaced.
