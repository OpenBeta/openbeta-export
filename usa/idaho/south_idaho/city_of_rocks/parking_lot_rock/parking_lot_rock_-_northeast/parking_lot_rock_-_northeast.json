It is found on the north east side of Parking Lot rock, just east of Cario (5.11a).\n\nThe climb starts in a right facing dihedral, and follows a juggy crack with good gear.  A small bulge is pulled and the crux finger crack is just above.  Figure out the tricky moves along a finger crack and you will arrive at a ledge with 2 bolts.  An extra finger sized cam (#1 friend) will be helpful in the upper finger crack.","protection":"Gear to 2 inches, extra finger sized cams","location":""},"__v":0},{"_id":"XZ9qnrSMWbO7jYJuZw+uQQ==","name":"Inspiration or Perspiration","yds":"5.12b","grades":{"yds":"5.12b","french":"7b"},"fa":"Bill Boyle","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.72246,42.08386]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"109166242","mp_crag_id":"107590276","climb_id":"XZ9qnrSMWbO7jYJuZw+uQQ==","areaRef":"LynvuiY4X4WwhjTRiW66Sw=="},"content":{"description":"A long and varied route! Boyle certainly had an eye for the odd! Or was it just that the obvious plums had already been plucked? Powerful and tricky moves down low on a grainy and lichen covered slab give way to a taxing undercling sequence about a third of the way up. A short section of tricky face climbing with great patina crimps set you up on a long gritty, lichen covered slab with spaced out bolts (supplemental gear- see protection section). Finally, above the slab you get to the goods- overhanging granite huecos! Underclings, slopers, delicate stems and sneaky crack climbing skills are needed for this enduro finale. A very airy and pumpy finish! 12a power down low, and 12b endurance at the top. Many bolts are poorly placed in difficult to clip locations... as far as I can tell this is the timestamp of the early Boyle routes.","protection":"Bolts. A #1 camalot tames the potential ground fall between the 2nd and 3rd bolt. Finger sized cams and or nuts can be placed in the crack on the  middle slab section and would be helpful to soothe the timid.","location":"This route is just right of Bombs Over Tripoli (12a) and down hill and to the left from Thin Slice (10a). The chain anchors at the top are placed over a roof and the result it a lot of drag while lowering...consider rappelling."},"__v":0},{"_id":"KHg55SBjWwyIyZR6/q0YJQ==","name":"Cairo","yds":"5.11a","grades":{"yds":"5.11a","french":"6c"},"fa":"Dave Bingham, Tedd Thompson 1988","type":{"sport":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.72246,42.08386]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"105740960","mp_crag_id":"107590276","climb_id":"KHg55SBjWwyIyZR6/q0YJQ==","areaRef":"LynvuiY4X4WwhjTRiW66Sw=="},"content":{"description":"On the north end of the east face, scramble up a gully to a short overhaning arete.
