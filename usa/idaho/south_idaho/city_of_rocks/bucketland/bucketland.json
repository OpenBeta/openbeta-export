I think I recall placing a blue alien in poor rock to protect a 5.10 move, then whilst looking at a grounder from a few meters up, finally placing a red camalot.  From there, one can start climbing in earnest on a fairly physical 5.9 or 5.9+.  The hard part is over before the fun starts.\n\nClimb up steep flakes, cracks and plates to the top of the rock, taking a bit of a dodgine leftward path at the top (mind the rope drag) to an anchor.\n\nWhile the book topo suggests a 2-bolt anchor, the text mentions, accurately, a \"thread\" anchor.  We re-enforced that anchor in June 2016 in case some other poor sucker gets convinced to waste good time on this line.","protection":"2x tiny aliens or mastercams, 2x red camalots, and other stuff, with some long slings.","location":"More or less central to the W.
