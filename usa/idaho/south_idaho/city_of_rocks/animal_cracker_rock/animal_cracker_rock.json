It's possible that it is an undocumented climb instead of an true first ascent. In any case, this is a good route and deserves some mention and attention.\n\nStart in the clean corner atop the huge boulder left of the route 'The Assassin.' Climb a few features to get up into the crack, place gear and head on up in the corner. Although it gets wide near the top, a few placements are available in the back of the crack, and the climbing quickly eases off the 5.9 grade. Finish up the corner into a chucky 2-2.5\" (primarily) crack system that looks steeper from the ground... but holds abound. The climbing here is no harder than 5.8, and mostly 5.7 or below. Ride that to a gear belay on the summit, or just below on one of several shelves, according to what gear you have to set a belay with and what you see.\n\nBright red 'Western Columbine' flowers were everywhere up there in mid-June.","protection":"While the FA was done with nothing over 3.5\", it is noted that there were very significant runouts. A rack including at least to #4 Camalot, or perhaps even a single larger piece is recommended. A few 2' slings will help keep the rope in line despite a deep placement or two. The top crack takes 2\" gear, +/-.\n\nThere are many options for a gear belay up top.\n\nScramble off to the left (easier, but then nasty trail) or right (long, more involved route finding to keep it 5.4), but then easy trail to the base.","location":"Look up and left from Animal Cracker. There is a stack of Boulders below the arete to the left. This is below and left of a flake system that reaches the corner that reaches the handcrack. The top crack can be seen in the Bingham Guide between Routes 'A' and 'B', but is not shown as a route."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,f4466c3f-1d59-56da-9fa9-8ef51d12d53e,76021131-7623-5f5b-9efb-5dda911ccca8,abbebc02-c1f8-57b0-bcba-ee8efb064ed2,a975632a-58d7-540d-984d-74f01bd016bd","pathTokens":["USA","Idaho","South Idaho","City of Rocks","Animal Cracker Rock"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.10a"},{"count":1,"label":"5.9"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":2,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":2,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.72271,42.08716]},"bbox":[-113.72331590808353,42.08671033981813,-113.7221040919165,42.087609660181855],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"105739757","area_id":"qXVjKljXVA2YTXTwG9AWvQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-113.72331590808353,42.08671033981813],[-113.7221040919165,42.08671033981813],[-113.7221040919165,42.087609660181855],[-113.72331590808353,42.087609660181855],[-113.72331590808353,42.08671033981813]]]}},"content":{"description":""},"density":0,"totalClimbs":2,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:01:34.234Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:01:48.062Z"}
