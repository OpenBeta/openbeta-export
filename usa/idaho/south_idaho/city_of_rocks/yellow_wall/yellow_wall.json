It would be great to hit this on a busy day when all the roadside classics have lines. Combining it with White Lightning on your way in or out makes for an epic afternoon. Skinner's Roof is also on the approach in.\n\nStart in somewhat of a corner on the right end of the formation, and then after 15 feet or so traverse left into a long stemming section. Keep towards the left as you get to the top, staying on the left side of the protruding diving board above.\n\nThe route is somewhere in the range of 100-110 feet. Top roping is not advised due to the poor position of the single-bolt anchor relative to the top-out of the route.\n\nBe careful pulling your rope. The way the single bolt anchor is positioned on top of the formation makes it incredibly easy to get your rope pinched and cemented in. When we arrived at the route there was a rope hanging down the line that looked pretty haggard and wouldn't pull from the bottom.","protection":"We used a set of doubles from #3 down, only placed 1 #3 towards the top of the route. Placed a nut or two as well, but mainly cams. A lot of smaller gear, .75 on down.
