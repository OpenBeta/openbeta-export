It's still rated 10d. It was my first climb of that sort, when George took me to repeat it in 1967. I just thought it must be normal. I also really enjoyed the need for concentration and steady nerves. . . Probably the hardest slab climb in the country in those days was my brother, Greg's route, Infinite, in the City of Rocks. Infinite had lots of 5.10 spice climbing, and a 5.11c crux fully 30 feet above the last 1/4\" bolt. Kim Miller made the second ascent in the mid 'seventies and I repeated it afterwards. These may have been the only ascents of the route early on . . . .","protection":"Mostly old quarter inch bolts.","location":"Base of the Clamshell - upper City of Rocks.  Pitch 1 goes over the roof at the lowest part of the wall (old bolt) and ends at what used to be a two pin (lost arrows) anchor.  The original Lowe route goes left, undercling, and into a shallow grove that you need to step out of via a layback.  Clip the bolt and head for a small tree.  It gets steeper and steeper.  The danger would be falling and sliding down the groove and tripping over the rope that crosses it."},"__v":0},{"_id":"FBDhyMBXXwae5jifipWptw==","name":"Finite","yds":"5.10","grades":{"yds":"5.10","french":"6b"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"trad":true},"safety":"PG","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.71963,42.0864]},"left_right_index":1,"mp_id":"117284452","mp_crag_id":"107383542","climb_id":"FBDhyMBXXwae5jifipWptw==","areaRef":"NkE45qtWWZOtWHQ//mpudg=="},"content":{"description":"This is the second pitch variation to Greg Lowe's Infiinite. FA and original name are unknown. Finite is my suggestion for differentiating this variation from Greg's route. See comments for Infinite. This route is called Jay Goodwin Retrofit in Bingham's latest (2016) guide though I did not put it up. Bingham's line is slightly wrong as well; belay is at small tree, not right of it.\n\nStart as for Infinite but climb past first belay on Infinite (where RKM placed pins) to two bolt belay. Follow well-spaced bolts above to second belay (gear) next to small tree in arching groove. Crux is going over bulge above last bolt and getting to belay ledge. Pich three is same as Infinte - wander up increasingly easy unprotected slab to top of Clamshell. Walk off to the north.\n\nI have given a PG13 rating, but an R rating could apply as well.
