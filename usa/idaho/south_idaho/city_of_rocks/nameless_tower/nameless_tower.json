It's a little gritty but will clean up nicely with  more traffic. A few cams might help, as a couple of bolts are not obvious, but when you want them, they are there. The crux, at the end of the first short pitch, is well protected.\n\nThis is a fun climb. Too bad it doesn't continue to the summit, which  might be two more pitches... anyone?","protection":"Bolts and chain anchors make for a convenient and safe ascent.","location":"Go to the base of the rightmost part of the Tower and the route is clearly defined by the bolts.
