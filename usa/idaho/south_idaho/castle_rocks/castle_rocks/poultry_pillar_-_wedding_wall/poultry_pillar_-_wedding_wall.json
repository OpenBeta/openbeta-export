Clip second bolt with a double length sling, then step down and traverse back to the right.

Finish at To Have and To Hold anchor.","protection":"The lower middle of the route has very poor pro.  Possible to place a shallow angle piton in the very shallow crack, and, tie it off in combo with a very dubious micro stopper.  Above that, another thin horizontal crack takes a thin knifeblade with 4 really poor small stoppers which might protect the climb up to the flaring crack.  .5 cam through 3 camalot protects the rest of the climb.  Caution:  initial cam placement low in the crack might not hold as the crack is very flaired down low.  In combo with the poor pin/nuts, this is a serious possibly X rated lead.
