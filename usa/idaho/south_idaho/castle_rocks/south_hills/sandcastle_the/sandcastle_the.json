The first bolt is a bit up there but its not too hard to get too. Flip your rope over the feature on the opposite side of the chimney to have pro to reach over to clip the first bolt. Continue up fairly featured rock clipping 6 bolts total to the summit. Bring some chord for the anchor.\n\nThere is some exfoliation still but its not bad and will improve with traffic.
