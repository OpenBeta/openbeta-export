Could probably go at anywhere from V0-Vhard?. You could basically walk up the steps to the R of the problem to reach the finish holds (V0). If you use only the crack, from a sit start, this problem would be extremely difficult. At least it was for me, although I'm definitely no trad climber. Would be an absolutely classic problem this way, if not for the bad landing. Crack is fingers to hands with an easy topout, if you can make it that far.","protection":"Pads","location":"Behind Monkey Hole.
