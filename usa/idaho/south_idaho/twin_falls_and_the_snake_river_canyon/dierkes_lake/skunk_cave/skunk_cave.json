Some larger moves between bigger holds leads to a cruxy headwall.  Match a super cool slopey pinch with both hands and throw high, on marginal feet, to pull the first bulge.  Straightforward, but pumpy, finish on an overhanging face.  The guidebook calls it a 11.b/c, but I think it's much softer than that.  Only one really difficult move.
