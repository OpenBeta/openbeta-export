Start with hands on the juggy bump (left on side right on top), right foot on the small shelf directly below the bump, and left leg flagged out. This won't be a sit start as you are right over a stream. Move right along the outcropping until you've reached the end and then move up following the small crack to top out.","protection":"You could likely place a mat on the center rock, but the other bits go straight into the creek. If you fall, you'll get wet.","location":"From the parking lot/trail head go down to the beach and take a right. Follow the trail for .8 miles where you'll go through the first gate and find yourself in front of the Clubhouse (on your right). The \"Clubhouse Rubble\" and \"Clubhouse RipRap\" boulders will be to your left directly on the creek line. From those boulders look out into the rocky bit of the creek and you'll see the lone boulder almost to the other side next to a small tree. You'll have to wade through the creek a bit to get there, so bring your swimmies.Â "},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,fed48af3-cd87-55e0-84dc-566a8b682faf,712bd921-1a4e-5d90-87e1-5c65499109c6,287d3a06-a788-58e1-9e15-398c7e8fb982","pathTokens":["USA","South Carolina","Rocky Creek Bouldering","Island Boulder"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V1"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.91797,34.56253]},"bbox":[-80.91851603043158,34.56208033981814,-80.9174239695684,34.56297966018186],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"119286435","area_id":"KH06BqeIWOGeFTmMfo+5gg=="},"content":{"description":"Need Description"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:22:23.730Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:23.466Z"}
