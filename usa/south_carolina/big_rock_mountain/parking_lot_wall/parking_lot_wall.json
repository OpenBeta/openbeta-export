A good entry level 5.12.\n\n Begin on a small pedestal with a thin right facing flake. Follow the flake up placing an option finger sized piece or two to get to the first bolt. Clip the first bolt and figure out the explosive sequence to get to the next eyebrow. Clip another bolt and do another explosive move. Clip the tough third bolt and make a couple moves up and right. A tricky slab move gets you to the fourth bolt. More fun slab leads to the anchors at the lip.\n\n Can easily be TR'ed by walking around the formation to the left and gaining the top.","protection":"A couple of finger sized pieces and QD's for bolts.","location":"On the approach trail up, the trail turns left and goes under this route before turning right to enter into the final gully."},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,fed48af3-cd87-55e0-84dc-566a8b682faf,c0360b54-cab1-5094-b9ce-d8e2a548cff3,10d86753-3e3c-5bb7-9617-d98dc81ea325","pathTokens":["USA","South Carolina","Big Rock Mountain","Parking Lot Wall"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"5.12a"}],"byDiscipline":{"trad":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.78857,34.95617]},"bbox":[-82.78911864000884,34.955720339818136,-82.78802135999116,34.956619660181865],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"116191243","area_id":"ENhnUz48W7eWF9mNyB6jJQ==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-82.78911864000884,34.955720339818136],[-82.78802135999116,34.955720339818136],[-82.78802135999116,34.956619660181865],[-82.78911864000884,34.956619660181865],[-82.78911864000884,34.955720339818136]]]}},"content":{"description":"This wall is closest to the parking lot.
