A big piece can be placed at the first horizontal, or skip it and make the easy moves to the first bolt. Make a hard V4/5 deadpoint move at the first bolt. Stick the decently sized crimp and clip the second bolt. Continue traversing left to some larger rails and clip the third bolt. Make another hard move up using the crystal ball. Some thin and techy moves out right lead to the next bolt at a crimp rail. Make another tough deadpoint on bad feet to get into the horizontal break. From here the route takes gear to the top. Place a couple of thin pieces in the crack in the groove. Place one last piece of gear in the crack. Pull the bulge to anchors.\n\n Can easily be TR'ed from the anchors at the top.
