Easy to locate, a 20 second approach for many of the boulders and a little less than 100 fun and quality routes makes for a great after work or school bouldering area.  There are 4 sub areas at Little Eastatoee, including the Bridge Boulders, Bubbles, Indian Rock House and Rhodorete areas, with the Bridge Boulders being the easiest to approach in the parking lot. These boulders have seen ascents for a couple of decades, but not much information was available on specific routes until 5 or so years ago.  This area is best hit in the colder months of the year, late fall-early spring, and it gets great afternoon sun that shines on the Bridge Boulders until it sets.  Expect slabby boulders at Little Eastatoee, but there are a variety of boulders from overhanging to face climbs.
