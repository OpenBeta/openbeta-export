Coming from 295, take route 6 west to Brown ave. Drive a couple miles down Brown ave until you come to your SECOND parking area on your right. There is only enough room for 2-3 cars, and it's directly across the street from a chain link fence. Start walking into the woods, and almost immediately, the trail comes to a fork. Stay left and walk another 100 feet or so. It will be the large, overhanging boulder just off the trail to the left. The route starts on the right side of the boulder, on an obvious ledge close to the ground. Climb straight up to the ledge that runs across the length of the boulder, then move to the left until you reach the far end of the ledge, and top out from there. It's fairly short, but pretty challenging and a ton of fun.","protection":"Crash pad","location":""},"__v":0}],"children":[],"ancestors":"1db1e8ba-a40e-587c-88a4-64f5ea814b8e,10f89d9c-9003-5a54-bad9-5849a525a2de,c68c38d4-c990-539f-af83-6be290f09a9f,50fd0d04-4db8-535e-a183-fbe27ff6c073","pathTokens":["USA","Rhode Island","Snake Den","Crag  1"],"gradeContext":"US","aggregate":{"byGrade":[{"count":1,"label":"V3"}],"byDiscipline":{"bouldering":{"total":1,"bands":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}}},"byGradeBand":{"unknown":0,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"expert":0}},"metadata":{"isBoulder":false,"isDestination":false,"leaf":true,"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.53119,41.8538]},"bbox":[-71.53179369242014,41.85335033981814,-71.53058630757985,41.854249660181864],"left_right_index":-1,"ext_id":"111877597","area_id":"UP0NBE24U16hg/vif/bAcw==","polygon":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-71.53179369242014,41.85335033981814],[-71.53058630757985,41.85335033981814],[-71.53058630757985,41.854249660181864],[-71.53179369242014,41.854249660181864],[-71.53179369242014,41.85335033981814]]]}},"content":{"description":"The first cliff on the right."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:09.242Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:06.776Z"}
