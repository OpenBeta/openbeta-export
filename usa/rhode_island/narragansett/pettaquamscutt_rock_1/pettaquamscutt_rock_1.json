At about 10/12' off the group there is a crescent shaped jug that can be used to rest on if needed before using several blocky holds to reach the top of this small wall.  There are excellent feet and solid, juggy, handholds at the top, so pulling the top out is not complicated. ","protection":"Several pads, it is a fairly tall climb but the landing is pretty perfect.","location":"This climb in on the back side of Pettaquamscutt rock, if you are facing the rock this climb is about 15' to the right of the flake that People of the Small Point is on.  The easiest way to get there is by hiking around to the right.  After walking up to the trail past the basketball courts, go right at the fork in the trail and then right again at the next fork.  This will send up up a short hill that goes around to the back of Pettaquamscutt rock.  It easier walking this way with pads then it is trying to haul them up and over the front. "},"__v":0},{"_id":"CmvmQzlUXhC8Qq9wcrXbEw==","name":"Railgun","yds":"V3-","grades":{"yds":"V3-","font":"6A","vscale":"V3-"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.45409,41.4708]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"121882905","mp_crag_id":"108856632","climb_id":"CmvmQzlUXhC8Qq9wcrXbEw==","areaRef":"3eag3o2MVguajR0orIUK4A=="},"content":{"description":"Sit start on underclings, good feet below you, pull on and go up right hand to long edge in the middle of the face, match it up, get high feet, make a reach up and left to an edge more sloped on it's topped half. from here rock up and mantle over the top. ","protection":"1-2 pads.","location":"On the back side of Pettaquamscutt Rock, as if you were walking to People of The Small Point.
