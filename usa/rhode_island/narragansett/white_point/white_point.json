The rock, like that at Black Point, is primarily made up of granite crimps and slopers as well as numerous sharp quartz crystals that pepper the boulder.  The constant sea breeze rolling off the water at this boulder,and its neighbor Black Point, makes it a refreshing spot to climb at on hot summer days.The small cave offers perfect shelter from the sun in between climbs and when it's just too hot to climb.  The Black Point boulder and adjacent fishing area see a fair amount of traffic in summer months but the White Point boulder is fairly secluded from the trail and as a result it's rarely crowded."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:10.270Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:36.371Z"}
