Newtown Rock boasts nothing that will blow your socks off, but it has a few solid climbs at a lower grade. It is a great spot for bringing newer climbers as the problems are very short, they generally have positive holds to work with, and the downclimb is just walking around the back of the boulder."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":4,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:12.008Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:23.072Z"}
