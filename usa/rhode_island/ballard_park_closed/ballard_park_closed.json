Not seen from the road, but once you walk into the trails, you notice it goes up hill. Take that path to the top of the wall and walk down the east side to the bottom. Expect broken glass, quartzite and graffiti.\n\n There would be some bouldering and a little scrappy top roping and leading  (at least one route with old bolts), but the park is closed to climbing by Newport City ordinance\n\nWhile the park is closed to climbing please don't post up any routes. There is a little more historical information at ClimbRi Hopefully someday it will be opened. In the mean time, not perturbing the authorities will probably give a better chance of that happening.\n\n ​The Ordinance​​​"},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:08.819Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:17.909Z"}
