This description needs to be filled out. For now, see climbri.org/ for more info.\n\n Directions: 94 North takes a sharp right at Williams Mill Conservation Area. From this bend continue North about 1000 ft to find parking for one or two cars on the east side of the road. In summer these cliffs are just barely visible from the road and may take a little sluething to find. There is a lightly used trail leading to the first of two cliffs. From the road, its less than 200 yards. \n\n Some sections climbable as is. Others would need significant cleaning (moss/dirt/webs) to use. Average height of about 20' and a total length of 100 ft., including the two sections. A reasonably flat landing pad for bouldering.Â "},"density":0,"totalClimbs":1,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:08.819Z","updatedAt":"2022-11-25T11:21:34.738Z"}
