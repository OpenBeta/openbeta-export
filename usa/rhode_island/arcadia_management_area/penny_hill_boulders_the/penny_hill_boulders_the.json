Most of the climbing is on the two main boulders, which form a small cave where they butt together, with some silly lowballs on a third. These boulders are best visited when the gates are open, so you can park nearby, with only a short 10 minute hike to get to them. Otherwise, you will have to mountainbike or walk a little over a mile and a half. I'm not sure of the schedule, but the gate was closed this winter and opened in March. \n\n  As you approach the boulders from the trail, the right side of the cave is a great compression problem Porcelain Hook Slide V5++ which follows a fat rib up the arete.. To the right of it is a hard project that will require powerful crimping out high quality rock, then some easier routes. Around back there is a short route out the other end of the cave and a good wall on the backside of the largest boulder, that has some good, but crimpy face climbing, an arete and around the corner a tall slabby face with a good layback crack."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":5,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:09.680Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:07.549Z"}
