Originally found by Dana Seaton and Mike Galoob in 1999 after getting lost in the woods. Problems range from v1 to v11-12. Note - this is a superb boulder so has gotten some attention by exuberant groups. Though it may seem you are way out in the woods by yourself due to the long indirect approach, you are actually well within earshot of a residence. Please keep your noise level to a minimum and leave the boulder cleaned of tick marks. If you do your part to rake the leaves off the top it will help for a dry visit the next time too. This boulder is on DEM land, but a private property border is just up the trail. (see comments below)This boulder is best visited during the prime cool dry season, as it can get very buggy and jungle like feeling in the heat of Summer. Wear plenty of orange during hunting season, seriously. Some of you have been in hunters sights without having a clue."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":12,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:10.266Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:19.681Z"}
