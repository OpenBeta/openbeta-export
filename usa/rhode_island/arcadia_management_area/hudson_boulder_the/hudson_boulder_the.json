Hudson Trail. It is a long low boulder, only about 8 feet tall, mostly notable for the scoring and line of multiple hand drilled  holes that show the technique colonialists used to split rock. Slivers of metal called feathers were placed in the holes and small wedges were inserted. Each was successively tapped until the boulders would split in two. However, each end is overhanging and there is some good climbing. What it lacks in hight it makes up with interesting holds with a number of sloper problems. The left overhang has the ultimate mantle problem. Marc Troob put up some lines here years ago.  \n\n  The boulder could use a bit of scrubbing, but make sure not to remove the stuck metal feathers for historical reasons. Make a special effort to brush your chalk off before you leave as this boulder is visited by non climbers. \n\n  It is worth a stop to have a look and warm up on it a little before heading on to bigger and better things at the somewhat fingery Found Boulder."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:10.266Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:07.663Z"}
