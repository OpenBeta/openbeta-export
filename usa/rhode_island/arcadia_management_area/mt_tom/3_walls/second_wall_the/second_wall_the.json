Take your pick of the available holds (I used two underclings), pull on and get establish high enough to reach a sharp incut flake with a thumb catch with your left hand, or go all the way up to a good incut pocket in the back if you are tall. A high right pinch will then get you up to a sloper where you can match. Bring your feet up, so you can reach a good edge in a seam up and out left from which you can gain the good horizontal. Carefully top out through the slot. \n\n  The sit down start should add considerable difficulty, and the low traverse in from the left even more.","protection":"multiple pads and a good spot.
