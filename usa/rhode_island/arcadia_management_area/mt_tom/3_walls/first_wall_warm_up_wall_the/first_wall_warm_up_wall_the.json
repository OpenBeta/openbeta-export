Stem off the slab under the left side of the lowest roof and climb up to the layback crack that is the start of Wiessner's Crack, which will get you to the lip of the second roof. Climb the middle of the face using a quartz edge as an intermediary to gain a nice scoopy hold just below the upper vertical crack. There was a nice but crumbly pocket at the lip on the FA, but subsequent cleaning took it away, so you get to use the good layback flake to the left. Once matched on the scoopy hold, bring you left foot up and reach around the arete with your right hand to gain a good incut in the horizontal which will allow you to set up to layback the upper crack.
