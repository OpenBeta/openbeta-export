It is roughly 5 minutes in. The trail runs right along the top, with the wall dropping off to the right. Much of it looks like a jumble of rock from above, but there are a couple of more prominent sections. \n\n  The Scoop is a highball (18') with the crux near the top. It is on a face about in the middle of this ledge and requires a dry spell to climb on due to runoff. A couple small but tall faces (15') away to the right when facing it is the Pine Line. I never could get an answer on a name so this one seems as good as any because of a prominent pine tree directly above the problem. There are a bunch of other as yet unrecorded lines, with a lot of it being in the kind of cool, moderate, needs some cleaning, do not fall territory. It has been seeing some activity and scrubbing over the past years, so check it out, as there may be more ready for climbing. It is right on the way and near the junction to get to a bunch of other areas so it is a pretty good place to warm up, with a bunch of easyish vertical climbing on good holds in a small area, with a few harder and thin problems."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":8,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:10.269Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-20T01:06:07.744Z"}
