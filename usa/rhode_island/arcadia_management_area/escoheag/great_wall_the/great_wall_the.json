It is about 45 wide X 12 tall, vertical, with lots of cool holds and a good landing. It should provide tons of good easy lines and will make a good spot for warming up. It faces west, but is down in a valley so doesn't get much of the end of day sun. There is a lot of surface area to clean, so we need people to come and take a section."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":0,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:10.270Z","updatedAt":"2024-02-19T18:39:36.357Z"}
