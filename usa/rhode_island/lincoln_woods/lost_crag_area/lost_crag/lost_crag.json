This is one of the more extensive chunks of rock at Lincoln Woods, where people used to sometimes set up TRs in the past for the higher problems. With pads they are now getting done more as highballs. At approximately 20-25 feet at spots and occasionally sporting bad landings, a TR might still be a good idea for some lines.   If coming from the The Best Kept Secret area area, you will be dropping down around the left edge of the Main Wall. You will know you are there by the big clinking Champagne glasses graffiti on the otherwise tall, beautiful, gently overhanging Blacksmith face. The far right side of this crag is named after the route Earth Mover. Below are more boulders, including Dream Time.
