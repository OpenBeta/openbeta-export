However, I have no idea if this line I'm submitting is that line at all. Just climb it and have fun guys. Start at the cluster of jugs about 5 feet to the right of 5.8 Crack, move up to the crimp near the \"B\" of \"Blunted\", make a big throw up to the first tier of the ledge (you will probably end up on a slopper/ crimp). Then match your hands to a real jug on the second tier of the ledge right behind the first tier.Grab a bad crimp or two and reach up and left to an undercling. From the undercling, climb slightly right on jugs until you reach the bottom of the small corner. Grab a hidden sidepull on your left and throw for a pinch before reaching the top of the boulder.
