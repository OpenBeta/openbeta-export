To be honest I really have no idea what grade this goes at.  My guess is V5-7, but that will also greatly vary based on the individuals stature and strengths, so I will let you guys throw up what grade you think it is, because mine is just a shot in the dark."},"__v":0},{"_id":"DGmoEGwNUXKdEekw137x9w==","name":"My Prrrecious","yds":"V5","grades":{"yds":"V5","font":"6C","vscale":"V5"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.77799,41.56712]},"left_right_index":0,"mp_id":"118875225","mp_crag_id":"118875206","climb_id":"DGmoEGwNUXKdEekw137x9w==","areaRef":"h6tutt01VXS25DvHmg5fnQ=="},"content":{"description":"A fun traversing problem starting from the middle of the cave out the opposite end of Shelob’s Lair.  Once again it is a pretty tight problem and the grade will vary based on height and stature.  You may scrape dab a little at the end of the problem but don’t worry about it as long as you aren’t thudding on the ground (they are more distractions than assistance).","protection":"Couple slim pads","location":"Start on the far ledge of the middle opening in the cave where the left hand start for Shelob’s Lair is.  Traverse your way as far along the ledge as you can and make a big move through a blank section to the exit portion of the problem.  From there finagle you’re way up and through the topout using whatever beta works for you.  For this problem any rock other than the ground is on."},"__v":0},{"_id":"gS85tuGBXlyqgdi34yNYIA==","name":"Bag End","yds":"V4","grades":{"yds":"V4","font":"6B","vscale":"V4"},"fa":"unknown","type":{"bouldering":true},"safety":"UNSPECIFIED","metadata":{"lnglat":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-71.77799,41.56712]},"left_right_index":3,"mp_id":"118875219","mp_crag_id":"118875206","climb_id":"gS85tuGBXlyqgdi34yNYIA==","areaRef":"h6tutt01VXS25DvHmg5fnQ=="},"content":{"description":"A short, sharp, and powerful problem going up the small face facing the Pyramid Boulder.
