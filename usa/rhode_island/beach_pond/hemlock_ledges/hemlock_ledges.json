The tallest portion, the right side, is about 45 feet tall and off vertical. Historically this has been a place for people to set up some easy top ropes, though  Brian Phillips'  old trad leads have recently  been retrobolted so there are a few rare for RI bolted lead climbs. Bolts, if they are OK there, should probably not proliferate too much and be well camouflaged as the area is very popular with other users, but the handful of moderate sport climbs on good quality rock are a welcome addition to RI climbing. For further info see http://www.climbri.org/beach.htmMoving left there is a cave like formation that you see up the hill as you first approach the crag. It is named the Hand of Man Cave for the silhouetted hands painted on the wall. This general area and to the left has had some recent development by boulderers and as such is described in the Deadwood Area.Continuing left, with occasional breaks are more walls, mostly about 25\" tall. There are more good short TR/solo/highball possibilities. Most are pretty easy and could use some cleaning. The rock tends to be very featured with good juggy holds. It is a little steeper over here so, though shorter than the right side, the lines can be good. It is possible to do some trad leading here if you want to practice your placements and don't mind the shortness. There are lots of trees up top for anchors and a couple bolted ones with chain so you only need a couple lockers (take care getting to them to set up. If scrubbed up, there could be some really long bouldering traverses, especially towards the left side."},"density":0,"totalClimbs":10,"__v":1,"createdAt":"2022-11-07T06:21:09.670Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T16:48:18.875Z"}
